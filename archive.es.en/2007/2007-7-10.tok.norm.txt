" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .

but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .
steinmeier mediates in estonia-russia dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians in tallinn protested violently in may , it was reported that steinmeier had practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of the monument in tallinn .
according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .
steinmeier will wrap up his trip saturday by opening a thomas mann festival in nida on lithuania 's curonian spit where the late german nobel laureate for literature had a summer home before world war ii . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .

but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .
steinmeier mediates in estonia-russia dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians in tallinn protested violently in may , it was reported that steinmeier had practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of the monument in tallinn .
according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .
steinmeier will wrap up his trip saturday by opening a thomas mann festival in nida on lithuania 's curonian spit where the late german nobel laureate for literature had a summer home before world war ii . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .
steinmeier mediates in estonia-russia dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians in tallinn protested violently in may , it was reported that steinmeier had practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of the monument in tallinn .
according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .
steinmeier will wrap up his trip saturday by opening a thomas mann festival in nida on lithuania 's curonian spit where the late german nobel laureate for literature had a summer home before world war ii . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .

a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .

steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .
steinmeier mediates in estonia-russia dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians in tallinn protested violently in may , it was reported that steinmeier had practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of the monument in tallinn .
according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .
steinmeier will wrap up his trip saturday by opening a thomas mann festival in nida on lithuania 's curonian spit where the late german nobel laureate for literature had a summer home before world war ii . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 10.07.2007 early elections loom as polish coalition collapses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy prime minister andrzej lepper was sacked poland is facing snap elections after its fractious three-way coalition broke down monday when the party of sacked deputy prime minister andrzej lepper pulled out of the government . " if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .

" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .
steinmeier mediates in estonia-russia dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians in tallinn protested violently in may , it was reported that steinmeier had practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of the monument in tallinn .
according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .
steinmeier will wrap up his trip saturday by opening a thomas mann festival in nida on lithuania 's curonian spit where the late german nobel laureate for literature had a summer home before world war ii . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible . " thor heyerdahl always made one-way trips , he always traveled downwind from a to b , " said görlitz .
" we plan on going from b back to a like all mariners would have done .

the keel boards allow the vessel to tack into the wind , something previous reed boats have not been able to accomplish . according to görlitz , the abora has completed a number of successful test runs under the skyline of new york city to see how the boat handled sailing into the wind .

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .
steinmeier mediates in estonia-russia dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians in tallinn protested violently in may , it was reported that steinmeier had practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of the monument in tallinn .
according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .
steinmeier will wrap up his trip saturday by opening a thomas mann festival in nida on lithuania 's curonian spit where the late german nobel laureate for literature had a summer home before world war ii . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible . " thor heyerdahl always made one-way trips , he always traveled downwind from a to b , " said görlitz .
" we plan on going from b back to a like all mariners would have done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thor heyerdahl standing in front of his raft ra ii in 1970 named after a god of the canary islands , the abora 3 was built on the shores of lake titicaca in bolivia by crewmember fermin limachi , an amyra indian whose father built boats for heyerdahl . " growing up next to one big boat after the other , all designed for ocean travel , i feel honored to be part of the crew , " said limachi .
" it 's my way of paying homage to my father . " sailing into the wind the boat is equipped with a single mast and 14 keel boards for steering - a technique görlitz developed during two earlier expeditions in the mediterranean on the abora 1 and abora 2 .
the keel boards allow the vessel to tack into the wind , something previous reed boats have not been able to accomplish . according to görlitz , the abora has completed a number of successful test runs under the skyline of new york city to see how the boat handled sailing into the wind . " we sailed for the second time under 80 degrees of true wind , so that is a very strong indication that this vessel is prepared for the atlantic voyage , " he said . a modern adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : görlitz tested the abora 3 off the coast of new york hailing from germany , norway , bolivia and the us , the crew of the abora 3 will have to endure the elements of the north atlantic - during hurricane season - without the comforts of even an onboard toilet .
however modern technology will be along for the trip including satellite communication and navigation , emergency transmitters and three inflatable rafts with room for 12 . for norwegian crewmember tormod granheim , all adventures are a balance of excitement , danger and exhaustive preparation . " people only see the adventure but they never understand the amount of groundwork that goes into an expedition such as this , " said granheim . abora 3 team members said they understood that the expedition can not prove that trans-atlantic trade existed , but if successful , görlitz said he hopes it will shed light on show that neolithic man was more advanced than previously thought . " these adventurers are trying to tell the human story which you can not explain just using science and dna , " said bauge .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .

but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .

but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible . " thor heyerdahl always made one-way trips , he always traveled downwind from a to b , " said görlitz .
" we plan on going from b back to a like all mariners would have done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thor heyerdahl standing in front of his raft ra ii in 1970 named after a god of the canary islands , the abora 3 was built on the shores of lake titicaca in bolivia by crewmember fermin limachi , an amyra indian whose father built boats for heyerdahl . " growing up next to one big boat after the other , all designed for ocean travel , i feel honored to be part of the crew , " said limachi .
" it 's my way of paying homage to my father . " sailing into the wind the boat is equipped with a single mast and 14 keel boards for steering - a technique görlitz developed during two earlier expeditions in the mediterranean on the abora 1 and abora 2 .
the keel boards allow the vessel to tack into the wind , something previous reed boats have not been able to accomplish . according to görlitz , the abora has completed a number of successful test runs under the skyline of new york city to see how the boat handled sailing into the wind . " we sailed for the second time under 80 degrees of true wind , so that is a very strong indication that this vessel is prepared for the atlantic voyage , " he said . a modern adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : görlitz tested the abora 3 off the coast of new york hailing from germany , norway , bolivia and the us , the crew of the abora 3 will have to endure the elements of the north atlantic - during hurricane season - without the comforts of even an onboard toilet .

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible . " thor heyerdahl always made one-way trips , he always traveled downwind from a to b , " said görlitz .
" we plan on going from b back to a like all mariners would have done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thor heyerdahl standing in front of his raft ra ii in 1970 named after a god of the canary islands , the abora 3 was built on the shores of lake titicaca in bolivia by crewmember fermin limachi , an amyra indian whose father built boats for heyerdahl . " growing up next to one big boat after the other , all designed for ocean travel , i feel honored to be part of the crew , " said limachi .
" it 's my way of paying homage to my father . " sailing into the wind the boat is equipped with a single mast and 14 keel boards for steering - a technique görlitz developed during two earlier expeditions in the mediterranean on the abora 1 and abora 2 .
the keel boards allow the vessel to tack into the wind , something previous reed boats have not been able to accomplish . according to görlitz , the abora has completed a number of successful test runs under the skyline of new york city to see how the boat handled sailing into the wind . " we sailed for the second time under 80 degrees of true wind , so that is a very strong indication that this vessel is prepared for the atlantic voyage , " he said . a modern adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : görlitz tested the abora 3 off the coast of new york hailing from germany , norway , bolivia and the us , the crew of the abora 3 will have to endure the elements of the north atlantic - during hurricane season - without the comforts of even an onboard toilet .
however modern technology will be along for the trip including satellite communication and navigation , emergency transmitters and three inflatable rafts with room for 12 . for norwegian crewmember tormod granheim , all adventures are a balance of excitement , danger and exhaustive preparation . " people only see the adventure but they never understand the amount of groundwork that goes into an expedition such as this , " said granheim . abora 3 team members said they understood that the expedition can not prove that trans-atlantic trade existed , but if successful , görlitz said he hopes it will shed light on show that neolithic man was more advanced than previously thought .

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible . " thor heyerdahl always made one-way trips , he always traveled downwind from a to b , " said görlitz .
" we plan on going from b back to a like all mariners would have done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thor heyerdahl standing in front of his raft ra ii in 1970 named after a god of the canary islands , the abora 3 was built on the shores of lake titicaca in bolivia by crewmember fermin limachi , an amyra indian whose father built boats for heyerdahl .

" it 's my way of paying homage to my father . " sailing into the wind the boat is equipped with a single mast and 14 keel boards for steering - a technique görlitz developed during two earlier expeditions in the mediterranean on the abora 1 and abora 2 .
the keel boards allow the vessel to tack into the wind , something previous reed boats have not been able to accomplish . according to görlitz , the abora has completed a number of successful test runs under the skyline of new york city to see how the boat handled sailing into the wind .

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible .

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible .

botanist and archaeologist dominique görlitz is no exception .
he 's setting sail to cross the atlantic - against the wind - in a reed boat . long before columbus or the vikings ever set foot on american soil , stone-age man made regular trans-atlantic trips in reed-hulled sailboats , according to görlitz ' theory .
the ancient mariners could have established trade routes between the americas , europe and africa by making use of the gulf stream and prevailing winds as many as 14,000 years ago . to test his theory , the 40-year-old german , accompanied by 11 volunteers , will attempt the journey of over 6,000 kilometers , setting sail in the abora 3 , a 41-foot-long -lrb- 12.5-meter -rrb- , 12-foot-wide -lrb- 3.7-meter -rrb- boat made completely out of reeds and rope , from new york on july 11 and hoping to land in spain within 65 days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this trip marks görlitz 's third reed boat expedition " we underestimate the capabilities of our ancestors , " said görlitz , who is embarking on the trip as part of his phd research at the university of bonn .
" homo-erectus was able to walk out of africa and settled the other continents almost 2 million years ago , why could a handful of neolithic seafarers not be able to cross this simple waterway ? " görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible . " thor heyerdahl always made one-way trips , he always traveled downwind from a to b , " said görlitz .
" we plan on going from b back to a like all mariners would have done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thor heyerdahl standing in front of his raft ra ii in 1970 named after a god of the canary islands , the abora 3 was built on the shores of lake titicaca in bolivia by crewmember fermin limachi , an amyra indian whose father built boats for heyerdahl . " growing up next to one big boat after the other , all designed for ocean travel , i feel honored to be part of the crew , " said limachi .
" it 's my way of paying homage to my father . " sailing into the wind the boat is equipped with a single mast and 14 keel boards for steering - a technique görlitz developed during two earlier expeditions in the mediterranean on the abora 1 and abora 2 .
the keel boards allow the vessel to tack into the wind , something previous reed boats have not been able to accomplish . according to görlitz , the abora has completed a number of successful test runs under the skyline of new york city to see how the boat handled sailing into the wind . " we sailed for the second time under 80 degrees of true wind , so that is a very strong indication that this vessel is prepared for the atlantic voyage , " he said . a modern adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : görlitz tested the abora 3 off the coast of new york hailing from germany , norway , bolivia and the us , the crew of the abora 3 will have to endure the elements of the north atlantic - during hurricane season - without the comforts of even an onboard toilet .
however modern technology will be along for the trip including satellite communication and navigation , emergency transmitters and three inflatable rafts with room for 12 . for norwegian crewmember tormod granheim , all adventures are a balance of excitement , danger and exhaustive preparation . " people only see the adventure but they never understand the amount of groundwork that goes into an expedition such as this , " said granheim . abora 3 team members said they understood that the expedition can not prove that trans-atlantic trade existed , but if successful , görlitz said he hopes it will shed light on show that neolithic man was more advanced than previously thought . " these adventurers are trying to tell the human story which you can not explain just using science and dna , " said bauge .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .

red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .

after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .

according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .

but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .
the social democrats would score a largely unchanged 12 percent and the psl five percent , the poll found . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" görlitz said he believes the discovery of tobacco beetles and cocaine - native to the americas - in the egyptian tombs of ramses ii and tutankhamen , both of whom lived around 1300 b.c. , along with the stone-age cave drawings of boats and ocean currents founds near gibraltar strongly support the idea that trans-atlantic trade occurred long before christopher columbus set sail in 1492 . a return journey if successful , the crossing will mark the return leg of an earlier expedition by the norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl . twenty-three years after his ground-breaking voyage aboard the kon-tiki in 1947 , heyerdahl sailed a papyrus boat called the ra ii from morocco to the bahamas , proving that trans-atlantic sailing - at least with prevailing winds - was possible . " thor heyerdahl always made one-way trips , he always traveled downwind from a to b , " said görlitz .
" we plan on going from b back to a like all mariners would have done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thor heyerdahl standing in front of his raft ra ii in 1970 named after a god of the canary islands , the abora 3 was built on the shores of lake titicaca in bolivia by crewmember fermin limachi , an amyra indian whose father built boats for heyerdahl . " growing up next to one big boat after the other , all designed for ocean travel , i feel honored to be part of the crew , " said limachi .
" it 's my way of paying homage to my father . " sailing into the wind the boat is equipped with a single mast and 14 keel boards for steering - a technique görlitz developed during two earlier expeditions in the mediterranean on the abora 1 and abora 2 .
the keel boards allow the vessel to tack into the wind , something previous reed boats have not been able to accomplish . according to görlitz , the abora has completed a number of successful test runs under the skyline of new york city to see how the boat handled sailing into the wind . " we sailed for the second time under 80 degrees of true wind , so that is a very strong indication that this vessel is prepared for the atlantic voyage , " he said . a modern adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : görlitz tested the abora 3 off the coast of new york hailing from germany , norway , bolivia and the us , the crew of the abora 3 will have to endure the elements of the north atlantic - during hurricane season - without the comforts of even an onboard toilet .
however modern technology will be along for the trip including satellite communication and navigation , emergency transmitters and three inflatable rafts with room for 12 . for norwegian crewmember tormod granheim , all adventures are a balance of excitement , danger and exhaustive preparation . " people only see the adventure but they never understand the amount of groundwork that goes into an expedition such as this , " said granheim . abora 3 team members said they understood that the expedition can not prove that trans-atlantic trade existed , but if successful , görlitz said he hopes it will shed light on show that neolithic man was more advanced than previously thought . " these adventurers are trying to tell the human story which you can not explain just using science and dna , " said bauge .

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

" if there is no majority government , then early elections remain the only solution , " said prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency .
" the aggression of the opposition makes it impossible to have a minority government , " he added .
he said voters could be called to the polls in the autumn unless andrzej lepper 's populist samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party changed its mind .
samoobrona leader lepper was fired on monday evening after being caught up in an anti-corruption investigation .
" i offered jaroslaw kaczynski my resignation , while also warning that it would mean the end of the coalition government , but apparently the decision to sack me had already been made , " lepper said in an interview with channel tvn24 .
samoobrona and the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- were junior coalition partners with kaczynski 's conservative law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
anti-corruption probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski government spokesman jan dziedziczak announced that lepper , who was also agriculture minister , had been fired amid an anti-corruption probe .
" the decision follows facts revealed in connection with the operations of the national anti-corruption bureau , related to a case of large-scale corruption , " dziedziczak said .
" two people have been arrested in connection with the case , " he said .
lepper confirmed to tvn24 that anti-corruption investigators had searched the agriculture ministry and said one of his aides was detained .
kaczynski later announced that sports minister tomasz lipiec , a member of the lpr , had also been sacked , and accused both men of graft .
" there are strong signs testifying to the fact that andzrej lepper and tomasz lipiec are implicated in criminal activities , " kaczynski told reporters , alleging that " bribes worth millions " were involved .
attempts to bolster minority kaczynski 's conservatives brought the rural-based samoobrona and the ultra-catholic lpr into government in may last year .
the move was meant to bolster the minority government of pis , which narrowly won elections in september 2005 and had been relying on their tacit support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 kaczynski has sacked lepper before , after the two men logged horns last september over the 2007 budget and plans to send more polish troops to afghanistan .
but kaczynski was forced to bring lepper back into the cabinet in mid-october to end a three-week political crisis and stave off snap elections .
before monday 's bust-up , the coalition controlled only 224 seats in poland 's 460-member parliament - pis has 149 seats , while samoobrona holds 46 and the lpr 29 .
shaky alliances the government has managed to stay in power thanks in part to divisions among opposition parties , which agree on little except that they dislike poland 's rulers .
the liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , with which pis held fruitless coalition talks in 2005 , has 131 seats , while the ex-communist social democrats have 55 and samoobrona 's main rival , the polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- , has 25 .
smaller conservative and populist groups , plus independents , hold the rest .
early elections are not in the interest of pis , samoobrona or the lpr , according to a survey released friday by the cbos polling institute .
it found that if elections were called immediately , po would edge pis with 27 percent of the vote to 25 percent .
samoobrona would see its 2005 score slashed by half to six percent and the lpr , which received eight percent in the last elections , would not clear the five-percent threshold required for seats .

" one of the issues addressed will certainly be relations between the eu and russia , " he told a regular government news conference .
" you are aware that a few difficult situations developed in the last six months .
these were difficulties which in our opinion have been tempered recently by a willingness on both sides for dialog . "
steinmeier , who will be traveling with a delegation from german cultural institutions , will meet government leaders , presidents and foreign ministers in each of the three countries , which are eu and nato members .
plötner said ties with each of the three countries had deepened during germany 's six-month presidency of the european union , which ended june 30 .
berlin moved to advance ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors such as ukraine during the german presidency in cooperation with the baltic states .
red army memorial row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal of the memorial sparked controversy relations between russia and the baltic republics have been strained for the last 16 years since the countries gained independence as the soviet union fell apart .
a bitter dispute over the removal of a red army memorial in april plunged relations between estonia and russia to their lowest level since 1991 .
moscow blasted the move as a " blasphemous " affront to the soviet dead , and tallinn has accused the kremlin of being behind cyber-attacks in may that forced the closure of government web sites and disrupted top businesses to take revenge over the moving of the war memorial .
plötner said steinmeier had spoken with both sides during the crisis to help cool tempers .
steinmeier mediates in estonia-russia dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians in tallinn protested violently in may , it was reported that steinmeier had practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of the monument in tallinn .
according to a report in the daily financial times deutschland , steinmeier suggested the estonian ambassador to russia go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation .
steinmeier called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov to suggest not only that estonian ambassador marina kaljurand take a holiday , but also that moscow drop the dispute for the time being , the paper reported .
after speaking with moscow , steinmeier reportedly called estonian foreign minister urmas peat and got him to agree to the deal , the financial times reported .
ambassador kaljurand left moscow on thursday for a two-week vacation and pro-kremlin youth activists blockading the estonian embassy in moscow ended their protests the same day .
steinmeier will wrap up his trip saturday by opening a thomas mann festival in nida on lithuania 's curonian spit where the late german nobel laureate for literature had a summer home before world war ii . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would reduce the total us atomic weapons arsenal in europe to about 350 .
it marks a fraction of what the us deployed in europe during the cold war .
" i think it 's almost certain that the bombs are n't in ramstein anymore , " hans m. kristensen , author of the study , told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel .
" in any case , there are several indications that they are n't there anymore . "
" the best proof you can get " the fas study cited a public report by the us air forces in europe -lrb- usafe -rrb- from january 2007 , which lists nuclear installations in europe to receive visits in the coming months from american nuclear safety experts who usually help local teams prepare for regular technical inspections .
for the first time the ramstein air base is not on the list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states still has around 350 nuclear weapons stationed in europe dating from the cold war since inspections for all us nuclear bases in europe are mandatory , the fas believe that the removal of ramstein from the list is proof that it no longer contains nuclear weapons .
" the list clearly proves that the weapons are gone , " kristensen said .
" the army ca n't store them there without regular inspections .
in this business , this is the best proof you can get . "
neither the pentagon nor the german defense ministry has officially reacted to reports of the removal of the nuclear arsenal at ramstein .
welcome news for anti-nuclear lobby it remains unclear when , if at all , the nuclear weapons were removed from ramstein .
the issue flared up in 2005 when members of germany 's previous social democrat-green government vowed to take up the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil at nato amid widespread opposition across party lines about their continuing presence .
proponents of a withdrawal of the weapons argued that they were a cold war relic and undermined the international non-proliferation process .
by the time the cold war ended in the late 1980s , more than 2 , 570 nuclear weapons were estimated to have been deployed across dozens of locations in germany alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists in germany demonstrate against nuclear armament with a skull-faced statue of liberty nestled in a bomb in 2005 , der spiegel , citing unnamed german defense officials , also reported that nuclear bombs in ramstein stored in special underground vaults had been discreetly removed during major construction work at the air base .
the assumption now is that the weapons were never returned to ramstein .
remaining nuclear weapons raise pressure on berlin reports of the likely withdrawal of the 130 nuclear weapons from ramstein will be welcomed by germany 's anti-nuclear lobby as a boost for disarmament efforts .
but experts point out that the withdrawal also raises pressure on the government to justify the presence of the remaining us nuclear arsenal on german soil .
politicians from germany 's opposition green party and the left party have long demanded the complete pull-out of all nuclear weapons from the country .
according to the usafe list of us nuclear installations in europe , the only remaining us air base in germany that contains nuclear weapons is büchel in the country 's southwest .
it 's believed to hold around 20 nuclear bombs in underground bunkers .
" it will now be difficult for the federal government to justify the remaining nuclear weapons in germany , " wrote otfried nassauer , director of the berlin center for transatlantic security in an article for der tagesspiegel newspaper .
he argued that the nuclear weapons in germany failed to fulfill any military purpose but rather ran up huge costs because of the need for expensive personnel to monitor them .
" until now the federal government always told proponents of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons that washington continued to stick to the deployment of nuclear weapons in germany and it was berlin 's duty to show solidarity in nato , " nassauer wrote .
" the first argument no longer holds .
the federal government now needs to justify why it continues to support the storing of nuclear weapons when the us itself no longer considers it necessary in germany .

the ex-leader and his wife pojaman were named in a case involving allegations of wrongdoing in a land deal .
mr thaksin , who has lived abroad since he was ousted in a military coup last september , has denied any wrongdoing .
the first court hearing is due on 14 august .
several other cases of alleged corruption and abuse of power are pending against mr thaksin .
" the supreme court political crime section accepts the case , " tonglor chomngarm , the supreme court 's deputy head , told reporters . "
as of now the two defendants will not return to fight the case on the grounds that the judicial process is still being interfered with " noppadol pattama thaksin family 's solicitor the charges relate to the purchase of a prime plot of land in bangkok in 2003 by mr thaksin 's wife pojaman , for 772m baht -lrb- $ 24m ; £ 12m -rrb- .
the land , owned by a government agency , had earlier been valued at 2.1bn baht -lrb- $ 66m , £ 32m -rrb- .
mr thaksin is accused of illegally influencing the deal .
if convicted , the couple could be jailed for up to 13 years and face a fine .
anti-corruption investigation prosecutors told reporters that mr thaksin and his wife had been ordered by the court to attend the opening arguments .
the former prime minister has remained abroad - mainly in london where he has a house - since last year 's bloodless coup .
he said last month that he would only return to thailand to face corruption charges if he could be sure of a fair trial .
mr thaksin 's solicitor , noppadol pattama , said on tuesday that his client would not be returning for the opening arguments .
" both of them will fight the case , but as of now the two defendants will not return to fight the case on the grounds that the judicial process is still being interfered with , " he told the afp news agency .
however , a conviction in thailand could affect mr thaksin even if he stays in exile , the bbc 's jonathan head in bangkok says .
his recent acquisition of the british football club , manchester city , is still subject to the football association 's " fit and proper person " test , which specifically bars people convicted of corruption , even in a foreign court , our correspondent adds .
military leaders who carried out last september 's coup cited corruption and abuse of power in mr thaksin 's government as their justification .
the billionaire former prime minister and his family have since been under investigation by an anti-graft panel set up by the military-installed government .
other charges currently pending against mr thaksin include concealing his assets and implementing policies that favoured his family 's business empire .
more than $ 1.5bn of his assets have been frozen .
mr thaksin argues that the investigation and charges are politically motivated .

if convicted , the couple could be jailed for up to 13 years and face a fine .
anti-corruption investigation prosecutors told reporters that mr thaksin and his wife had been ordered by the court to attend the opening arguments .
the former prime minister has remained abroad - mainly in london where he has a house - since last year 's bloodless coup .
he said last month that he would only return to thailand to face corruption charges if he could be sure of a fair trial .
mr thaksin 's solicitor , noppadol pattama , said on tuesday that his client would not be returning for the opening arguments .
" both of them will fight the case , but as of now the two defendants will not return to fight the case on the grounds that the judicial process is still being interfered with , " he told the afp news agency .
however , a conviction in thailand could affect mr thaksin even if he stays in exile , the bbc 's jonathan head in bangkok says .
his recent acquisition of the british football club , manchester city , is still subject to the football association 's " fit and proper person " test , which specifically bars people convicted of corruption , even in a foreign court , our correspondent adds .
military leaders who carried out last september 's coup cited corruption and abuse of power in mr thaksin 's government as their justification .
the billionaire former prime minister and his family have since been under investigation by an anti-graft panel set up by the military-installed government .
other charges currently pending against mr thaksin include concealing his assets and implementing policies that favoured his family 's business empire .
more than $ 1.5bn of his assets have been frozen .
mr thaksin argues that the investigation and charges are politically motivated .

the comments were made by the chief inspector of probation , andrew bridges , in the inspectorate 's annual report .
mr bridges said the probation service could not meet the public 's expectation that all re-offending was preventable .
the ministry of justice said it will take his observations seriously and ministers said a review was underway .
this is being conducted to ensure end-to-end supervision of offenders could be sensibly implemented .
public expectations although probation budgets have increased considerably over the past 10 years , mr bridges says they have not kept pace with the increasing demands on the service .
the bbc 's home affairs correspondent , danny shaw , says rising prison populations mean there are more offenders who will subsequently require monitoring .
complicated supervision schemes like drug treatment orders , prolific offender programmes and the sex offenders register have also increased workload , he says .
because of this , mr bridges says the government 's goal of co-ordinated and continuous management of offenders " risks being proven undeliverable " .
this in turn , he says , will make it harder to satisfy public expectations about being protected .
he said : " our overall point here is not a proposal to pour extra resources unthinkingly into the problem but to highlight the contrast , which has developed slowly over a long period of time , between rising expectations and a squeezed capacity to meet them .

the european food safety authority has expressed concern about the use of the colouring e128 , also known as red 2g .
its expert panel on food additives has recommended that the dye should no longer be considered safe for human consumption .
the food standards agency is currently investigating whether products containing e128 are on sale in the uk . "
it is not possible to determine a level of intake for aniline which may be regarded as safe for humans " european food safety authority a spokeswoman for the food and drink federation , which represents uk manufacturers , said the use of red 2g here was " likely to be minimal " .
under current eu food laws , limited amounts of red 2g are permitted for use in sausages with a minimum cereal content of 6 % and in burger meat with a minimum vegetable and / or cereal content of 4 % .
cancer in mice however , red 2g is converted in the body into an oily substance called aniline , which has now been shown in tests on rats and mice to have the potential to trigger cancer .
animals injected with aniline developed cancerous tumours .
in a statement the efsa panel said : " given new scientific evidence , it can not be excluded that aniline 's carcinogenic potential is due to damage to the genetic material of the cells .
" it is therefore not possible to determine a level of intake for aniline which may be regarded as safe for humans .
" the panel therefore concluded that red 2g should be regarded as being of safety concern . "
the efsa , which is re-examining the scientific evidence on all food colourings , has passed its findings to the european commission .
red 2g is already banned in a number of countries , including japan .

the madeira river projects have divided opinion even within government and in recent years have been one of the most environmentally sensitive issues .
the river is said to have one of the most diverse fish stocks in the world .
environmentalists fear they could be threatened by the development of the dams costing billions of dollars .
such have been the sensitivities surrounding this decision that brazil 's environmental agency ibama took two years to reach this initial conclusion and even now has attached 33 conditions to the project .
the project still needs final approval before any work can go ahead .
development v environment the intense debate , both inside and outside government , summed up the challenge in brazil to reconcile the ambitions of a developing country alongside the need to protect the environment .
brazil suffered extensive power cuts in 2001 and president luiz inacio lula da silva was determined this was an episode that would not be repeated .
the government believes the two dams , when built , could supply around 8 % to 10 % of the national demand for electricity .
critics fear it will cause damage to the amazon area by disturbing the flow of sediments in the madeira river , as well as bringing thousands of workers and their families to an area where resources are already overstretched .
there are also worries that the construction would stir up mercury levels in the river and one of the conditions attached to the project is that this should be carefully monitored .
thousands of families also depend on the river for their income and the impact on their lives could be significant .
the government says the environmental consequences will be minimised by the conditions attached to the proposed dams .

the madeira river projects have divided opinion even within government and in recent years have been one of the most environmentally sensitive issues .
the river is said to have one of the most diverse fish stocks in the world .
environmentalists fear they could be threatened by the development of the dams costing billions of dollars .
such have been the sensitivities surrounding this decision that brazil 's environmental agency ibama took two years to reach this initial conclusion and even now has attached 33 conditions to the project .
the project still needs final approval before any work can go ahead .
development v environment the intense debate , both inside and outside government , summed up the challenge in brazil to reconcile the ambitions of a developing country alongside the need to protect the environment .
brazil suffered extensive power cuts in 2001 and president luiz inacio lula da silva was determined this was an episode that would not be repeated .
the government believes the two dams , when built , could supply around 8 % to 10 % of the national demand for electricity .
critics fear it will cause damage to the amazon area by disturbing the flow of sediments in the madeira river , as well as bringing thousands of workers and their families to an area where resources are already overstretched .
there are also worries that the construction would stir up mercury levels in the river and one of the conditions attached to the project is that this should be carefully monitored .
thousands of families also depend on the river for their income and the impact on their lives could be significant .
the government says the environmental consequences will be minimised by the conditions attached to the proposed dams .

the national autistic society cymru -lrb- nas cymru -rrb- said only 11 % made it through further education , training and into full-time employment as adults .
on tuesday the moving on up ? document will be discussed at the assembly 's cross-party autism group , attended by education minister carwyn jones .
the welsh assembly government has said it is working on an autism strategy .
autism can affect the ability to understand and communicate , interact socially with others and to think and behave flexibly .
nas cymru , which spoke to teenagers and their parents for the report , has blamed a lack of support at transition stages between education and employment .
i am excited because i would be getting some cash and doing it for myself and working for it thomas hughes of those who did actually receive some assistance in " transition planning " , the report found 45 % were dissatisfied with the process and only 26 % of parents felt the support offered was adequately co-ordinated .
the charity has called for a number of measures including better career advice and more work experience .
thomas hughes , 17 , from caerphilly , was diagnosed with autism at the age of three and has recently finished a college course but worries his autism could hold him back .
" as soon as i get worried a lot , i 'll start panicking - i get panic attacks and my heart beats faster than normal , " he said .
" when i feel like that , i just want to be inside and be away from everyone until i feel better . "
but he said he was hard-working , independent and polite and was very keen at the prospect of finding a job .
" i am excited because i would be getting some cash and doing it for myself and working for it - i find it very important , " he added .
' vital stage ' liz withers , from nas cymru , said many people with autism had a great deal to offer and should have access to appropriate support .
" young people with autism can find change and anxiety over their future particularly hard to deal with and many are failing to fulfil their potential due to a lack of support at this vital stage in their lives , " she said .
" it is imperative that the welsh assembly government ensures that early and effective transition planning is in place for every young person with autism . "
an assembly government spokesperson said it has recently consulted on a draft autism strategy for wales which aims to improve the quality of life of people with autism and is now considering responses before publishing the final document .
it has also provided an extra £ 1.7m to local councils in a revenue settlement in recognition of the needs of children and young people with autism .

the £ 1.35m visitor centre will contain interactive displays and films telling of the 1485 battle which established the tudor dynasty in england and wales .
but since the firm overseeing the work folded just weeks from completion , plans have had to be reorganised .
the centre , which had been due to open at the end of july , is now expected to be finished in the autumn .
medieval village alan morrison , head of community services for the county council , said : " we are going to be working with all the suppliers and the sub-contractors to pull this together .
" we are hoping this will not add to the cost but it is a question of whatever it takes to get it up and running . "
he added that he would be " very disappointed " if the situation was not resolved by the end of november .
a medieval village is also being built on the site and this is on course for a late summer completion .
the centre is located on the traditional site of the battle at ambion hill near market bosworth but some historians have placed the true battlefield closer to the warwickshire border .
