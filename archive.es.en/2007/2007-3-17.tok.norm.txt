" poland has certain reservations about the wording of the declaration of berlin but in refusing to sign it we would have been the only country not to do so , " kaczynski told public television following a meeting with the chancellor in jurata in northern poland . polish leaders have wanted references to christianity to be included in the statement set to be issued to mark the eu anniversary . merkel left the meeting at the polish president 's residence on the hel peninsula at about noon after two days of meetings aimed at improving strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy paid off , it seems , despite some finger pointing on friday after her arrival , merkel had warned poland not to block the european constitution . " the time for reflection is past .
it 's time for decisions , " she said .
" let me say this uncategorically - failure to do this would be a historic missed opportunity . " merkel , whose country holds the eu presidency , wants the bloc to have a new constitution before 2009 . she has vowed to forge consensus on a new treaty over the coming months and present a " road map " for ratification at a brussels summit in june to streamline decision-making in the enlarged bloc . christianity question poland , a devoutly catholic country , has dug in its heels for a reference to christianity in the constitution . however kaczynski said poland was willing to resume talks on the basis of the existing text . the constitution project has been ratified by 18 member states but remains in limbo after it was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 . led by poland 's euro-sceptic identical twins , kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , warsaw last month urged the eu to ditch attempts to revive the constitution . relations between germany and poland have been tested recently .
one touchy issue involves germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's merkel warns and woos poland german chancellor angela merkel friday warned poland against blocking the european union 's stalled constitution , while she also sought to woo warsaw to germany 's side in building a stronger europe .

while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol . every afternoon , dozens of young drinkers gather on the square in central cottbus , after work , after school or after a day just hanging out at home .
and the more they drink , the more aggressive they become toward shoppers passing by .
in the past year , police have been called on to intervene about 140 times . as a result , the eastern german city wants to introduce a ban on street drinking .
laws are already in place in parts of berlin as well as some other regions , and now police officials in cottbus say they need better guidelines on how to handle the drinkers . " this is a very unpleasant situation , and it 's not doing the city or its reputation any good , " said wieland eschenburg of cottbus ' city council .
he said the city council has been searching for a solution that would be effective over the long term . questioning the point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long had relaxed laws around public alcohol consumption others , however , are questioning the point of the restrictions . " banning things makes them more attractive so the kids get more of a kick , and how do you punish youngsters anyway ? " asked one city resident .
" wagging a finger and telling them off wo n't work . " another resident said a ban would be unfair : " most people come here for a beer after work and just want to hang out with their friends and talk about what kind of a day they 've had - if people do n't like it , tough luck . " but people feel threatened and the police are at a loss .
they believe an alcohol ban is the only answer . public support the proposal has met with widespread public support - almost every local shop owner dislikes the presence of the young people on the square . " they 're a terrible blot on the landscape - knocking back their alcohol in public , " said one .
" all that beer and mulled wine and then they start running riot and it ends up getting really noisy . " " first thing in the morning , we have sweep up the glass so it does n't ruin everyone 's tires , " says another .
" it 's dreadful what goes on here .
if the police want an alcohol ban , they should introduce one , not just talk about it but do it . " still , experts say that in legal terms , introducing an alcohol ban is far from straightforward . spandau 's solution several years ago , the berlin suburb of spandau faced a similar problem when gangs of drinkers started regularly meeting in the pedestrian zone .
an alcohol ban soon got rid of them , but today , the ban is no longer in place .
it had to be lifted for legal reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin district of spandau forbade drinking in public for a time meanwhile , the authorities in berlin 's prenzlauerberg neighborhood are trying a different strategy .
although alcoholics and homeless people hang out on most of the district 's squares , the residents do n't seem to be too bothered . it 's as though everyone has tacitly agreed to get along and the local council has no intention of getting tough . " i think that would be the wrong approach , and it would have to be done in a neighborly way in the same way other neighborhood conflicts are resolved , " said jens-holger kirchner of the prenzlauer berg district council .
" if that failed , we might consider increasing a police presence as a way of keeping the peace . " out of sight social workers at berlin 's treberhilfe outreach project are all too familiar with their clients ' alcohol problems . they know these people can get out of hand when they 've had too much to drink , but they do n't think alcohol bans would help either . " the difficulty then is that these people are hounded out of public spaces and their problems simply continue behind closed doors , which means we can longer reach them , " said social worker ingo tuchel .
" that can get very problematic . " but many people would prefer it that way - out of sight , out of mind . rupert wiederwald -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government to crack down on drunk driving with binge drinking gaining ground in germany , the german government is seeking to crack down on drunk driving among young people by imposing tough new laws including a zero-tolerance policy .

" poland has certain reservations about the wording of the declaration of berlin but in refusing to sign it we would have been the only country not to do so , " kaczynski told public television following a meeting with the chancellor in jurata in northern poland . polish leaders have wanted references to christianity to be included in the statement set to be issued to mark the eu anniversary . merkel left the meeting at the polish president 's residence on the hel peninsula at about noon after two days of meetings aimed at improving strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy paid off , it seems , despite some finger pointing on friday after her arrival , merkel had warned poland not to block the european constitution . " the time for reflection is past .
it 's time for decisions , " she said .
" let me say this uncategorically - failure to do this would be a historic missed opportunity . " merkel , whose country holds the eu presidency , wants the bloc to have a new constitution before 2009 . she has vowed to forge consensus on a new treaty over the coming months and present a " road map " for ratification at a brussels summit in june to streamline decision-making in the enlarged bloc . christianity question poland , a devoutly catholic country , has dug in its heels for a reference to christianity in the constitution . however kaczynski said poland was willing to resume talks on the basis of the existing text . the constitution project has been ratified by 18 member states but remains in limbo after it was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 . led by poland 's euro-sceptic identical twins , kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , warsaw last month urged the eu to ditch attempts to revive the constitution . relations between germany and poland have been tested recently .
one touchy issue involves germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's merkel warns and woos poland german chancellor angela merkel friday warned poland against blocking the european union 's stalled constitution , while she also sought to woo warsaw to germany 's side in building a stronger europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2007 poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out on a stroll , merkel , center , and president kaczynski , left , along with spouses polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday . angela merkel used her two-day trip to poland to call for fresh efforts to agree a constitution for the 27-nation european union and to get poland to come on board regarding a document to mark the eu 's 50th anniversary on march 25 . today , it appears that her efforts have brought some success . the polish government had recently signalled its negative attitude towards a strengthening of european institutions . but president lech kaczynski told merkel that warsaw would sign a declaration at an eu summit next week to mark the half-century anniversary of the treaty of rome , which founded the then european community . " poland has certain reservations about the wording of the declaration of berlin but in refusing to sign it we would have been the only country not to do so , " kaczynski told public television following a meeting with the chancellor in jurata in northern poland . polish leaders have wanted references to christianity to be included in the statement set to be issued to mark the eu anniversary . merkel left the meeting at the polish president 's residence on the hel peninsula at about noon after two days of meetings aimed at improving strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy paid off , it seems , despite some finger pointing on friday after her arrival , merkel had warned poland not to block the european constitution . " the time for reflection is past .
it 's time for decisions , " she said .
" let me say this uncategorically - failure to do this would be a historic missed opportunity . " merkel , whose country holds the eu presidency , wants the bloc to have a new constitution before 2009 . she has vowed to forge consensus on a new treaty over the coming months and present a " road map " for ratification at a brussels summit in june to streamline decision-making in the enlarged bloc . christianity question poland , a devoutly catholic country , has dug in its heels for a reference to christianity in the constitution . however kaczynski said poland was willing to resume talks on the basis of the existing text . the constitution project has been ratified by 18 member states but remains in limbo after it was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 . led by poland 's euro-sceptic identical twins , kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , warsaw last month urged the eu to ditch attempts to revive the constitution . relations between germany and poland have been tested recently .
one touchy issue involves germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's merkel warns and woos poland german chancellor angela merkel friday warned poland against blocking the european union 's stalled constitution , while she also sought to woo warsaw to germany 's side in building a stronger europe .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .

cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle . " until sunday , only the film team will be allowed to use in the main nave , which has upset more than a few people . they do n't understand why she shoot has to take place in a building they consider holy . " this is not even a high-quality production , not an ambitious film which one could possibly stand being shot in a church , " says one man who lives nearby .
" i have talked to several people in the area and their enthusiasm is also limited .
people think the church is selling itself . " the exact sum which the film company paid to the church is not clear .
because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .
surrounded by cramped apartment buildings and busy streets , the landmark church is an oasis of calm - or rather it usually is . a voice droning out of the loudspeakers belongs to himesh reshamiyya , one of the most celebrated pop singers in india .
he plays the lead in the bollywood film " aap ka suroor , " which is currently being shot in germany . agnes church is one of the film 's locations .
the producers want to simulate a night-time concert in the huge nave and covered the windows and walls with black drapes . no prayers , lots of song and dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancer from " bollywood - the musical " in a place where believers usually kneel down to pray , there are now 50 professional dancers in silver sequined dresses shaking their hips while a few hundred extras mill around waiting to play the cheering crowd . vinod is one of them .
he was born in india but lives in germany .
and he is a big fan of reshamiyya .
for the 16-year-old , the shoot is a special chance to see his star at close range . " i knew of him before , but i never met him , " he said .
" it 's totally different to see him personally now .
i 'm standing in the fourth row .
it 's cool and i 'm having a lot of fun . " but having fun and dancing in a church has raised a few eyebrows .
cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .
surrounded by cramped apartment buildings and busy streets , the landmark church is an oasis of calm - or rather it usually is . a voice droning out of the loudspeakers belongs to himesh reshamiyya , one of the most celebrated pop singers in india .
he plays the lead in the bollywood film " aap ka suroor , " which is currently being shot in germany . agnes church is one of the film 's locations .
the producers want to simulate a night-time concert in the huge nave and covered the windows and walls with black drapes . no prayers , lots of song and dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancer from " bollywood - the musical " in a place where believers usually kneel down to pray , there are now 50 professional dancers in silver sequined dresses shaking their hips while a few hundred extras mill around waiting to play the cheering crowd . vinod is one of them .
he was born in india but lives in germany .
and he is a big fan of reshamiyya .
for the 16-year-old , the shoot is a special chance to see his star at close range . " i knew of him before , but i never met him , " he said .
" it 's totally different to see him personally now .
i 'm standing in the fourth row .
it 's cool and i 'm having a lot of fun . " but having fun and dancing in a church has raised a few eyebrows .
cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle . " until sunday , only the film team will be allowed to use in the main nave , which has upset more than a few people . they do n't understand why she shoot has to take place in a building they consider holy . " this is not even a high-quality production , not an ambitious film which one could possibly stand being shot in a church , " says one man who lives nearby .
" i have talked to several people in the area and their enthusiasm is also limited .
people think the church is selling itself . " the exact sum which the film company paid to the church is not clear .
because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

" if the growth in malware continues at the current pace , makers of anti-virus software may not be able to withstand the onslaught , " said eugene kaspersky , the respected russian expert on computer security , in a speech at the cebit expo in hanover , germany . his company , kaspersky lab , offers a minute-by-minute update on its website as new malware - a broad term covering viruses , spam , phishing and other methods of taking control of digital devices without permission - is discovered . his finnish rival , f-secure , says that on a bad day , its servers receive from customers 40,000 copies of files suspected of evil intent . " how can we deal with this avalanche , " asked f-secure chief research officer mikko hypponen , whose company has developed software to not only pick out known malware but also to automatically hunt for software doing anything suspicious . " this is not just a battle between manufacturers of security software and some internet criminals .
it is a war between good and evil , " declared hypponen , who was recently credited by a us magazine as being one of the 50 most influential people on the internet . no one safe computer security experts have regularly warned down the years that no one is completely safe , even if anti-virus advertising suggests that consumers can rest easy if they buy such products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worms and other malicious pieces of code can easily get into computers at cebit , it is plain that there are leaks in the dykes built by kaspersky , f-secure and other anti-virus companies . for a start , there is the sheer size of the onslaught , with the volume of malware growing last year by a factor of 2.5 .
kaspersky predicts comparable growth in the course of this year . " i would propose a sort of internet interpol , he said , referring to the un organization where police swap wanted data .
soon , no single suite of security software may be able to cope in this " spooky arms race " against unseen attackers . another weak point on the good side is the innocence of humans , which attackers are learning to exploit in ever more devious ways . a new trick involves sending people what appears to be an everyday invoice , for example for their tv license , with an exaggerated amount .
that makes people angry , and anger makes it easier to believe the e-mail really comes from a public institution . they click on an attachment that appears to be a pdf file , a common format for sending printed documents with e-mail . unfortunately the file is really a trojan horse : a form of software that steals account details and passwords or creates a zombie computer that distributes spam under criminal control . " we are dealing more and more with a worldwide industry that employs thousands of people , ' said kaspersky .
" i would not be surprised if they had greater turnover than the total sales of the security-software sector . " lucrative field hypponen pointed out that a spammer can live comfortably if just one in a million spam mails scores a sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer crime comes with high costs malware packages are being freely offered for sale on the internet for several thousand dollars apiece and some suppliers will write malware to order .
cyber-criminals even offer for rent the squadrons of zombie computers they control . unwitting home and small office users are providing the actual computers , electricity and other costs . the kings of spam , believed to live in china , russia and latin america , allegedly earn millions of dollars from the practice .
in poor countries , the temptation to mount such profitable attacks is all the greater . " these people are paying programmers the kind of salary that i could never afford , ' says natalya kaspersky , chief executive of the kaspersky company .
that attracts talented young people to the " evil side . " hypponen says malware , formerly the domain of amateurs , has been dominated by criminals since 2003 .
since last year , the cutting-edge malware appears to have been the work of espionage agencies . software engineer kaspersky says he worries about campaigns to increase computer use in emerging and underdeveloped economies . " at the moment , practically none of the malware is coming from africa , " he said .
" if africans began to join in , the pressure would become enormous .
and suppose that just 1 per cent of china 's population developed into online criminals .
we would n't have a chance .

while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol . every afternoon , dozens of young drinkers gather on the square in central cottbus , after work , after school or after a day just hanging out at home .
and the more they drink , the more aggressive they become toward shoppers passing by .
in the past year , police have been called on to intervene about 140 times . as a result , the eastern german city wants to introduce a ban on street drinking .
laws are already in place in parts of berlin as well as some other regions , and now police officials in cottbus say they need better guidelines on how to handle the drinkers .

if the police want an alcohol ban , they should introduce one , not just talk about it but do it . " still , experts say that in legal terms , introducing an alcohol ban is far from straightforward . spandau 's solution several years ago , the berlin suburb of spandau faced a similar problem when gangs of drinkers started regularly meeting in the pedestrian zone .

" i think that would be the wrong approach , and it would have to be done in a neighborly way in the same way other neighborhood conflicts are resolved , " said jens-holger kirchner of the prenzlauer berg district council .
" if that failed , we might consider increasing a police presence as a way of keeping the peace . " out of sight social workers at berlin 's treberhilfe outreach project are all too familiar with their clients ' alcohol problems . they know these people can get out of hand when they 've had too much to drink , but they do n't think alcohol bans would help either .

while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol . every afternoon , dozens of young drinkers gather on the square in central cottbus , after work , after school or after a day just hanging out at home .
and the more they drink , the more aggressive they become toward shoppers passing by .
in the past year , police have been called on to intervene about 140 times . as a result , the eastern german city wants to introduce a ban on street drinking .
laws are already in place in parts of berlin as well as some other regions , and now police officials in cottbus say they need better guidelines on how to handle the drinkers . " this is a very unpleasant situation , and it 's not doing the city or its reputation any good , " said wieland eschenburg of cottbus ' city council .
he said the city council has been searching for a solution that would be effective over the long term . questioning the point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long had relaxed laws around public alcohol consumption others , however , are questioning the point of the restrictions . " banning things makes them more attractive so the kids get more of a kick , and how do you punish youngsters anyway ? " asked one city resident .
" wagging a finger and telling them off wo n't work . " another resident said a ban would be unfair : " most people come here for a beer after work and just want to hang out with their friends and talk about what kind of a day they 've had - if people do n't like it , tough luck . " but people feel threatened and the police are at a loss .
they believe an alcohol ban is the only answer . public support the proposal has met with widespread public support - almost every local shop owner dislikes the presence of the young people on the square . " they 're a terrible blot on the landscape - knocking back their alcohol in public , " said one .
" all that beer and mulled wine and then they start running riot and it ends up getting really noisy . " " first thing in the morning , we have sweep up the glass so it does n't ruin everyone 's tires , " says another .
" it 's dreadful what goes on here .
if the police want an alcohol ban , they should introduce one , not just talk about it but do it . " still , experts say that in legal terms , introducing an alcohol ban is far from straightforward . spandau 's solution several years ago , the berlin suburb of spandau faced a similar problem when gangs of drinkers started regularly meeting in the pedestrian zone .
an alcohol ban soon got rid of them , but today , the ban is no longer in place .
it had to be lifted for legal reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin district of spandau forbade drinking in public for a time meanwhile , the authorities in berlin 's prenzlauerberg neighborhood are trying a different strategy .
although alcoholics and homeless people hang out on most of the district 's squares , the residents do n't seem to be too bothered . it 's as though everyone has tacitly agreed to get along and the local council has no intention of getting tough . " i think that would be the wrong approach , and it would have to be done in a neighborly way in the same way other neighborhood conflicts are resolved , " said jens-holger kirchner of the prenzlauer berg district council .
" if that failed , we might consider increasing a police presence as a way of keeping the peace . " out of sight social workers at berlin 's treberhilfe outreach project are all too familiar with their clients ' alcohol problems . they know these people can get out of hand when they 've had too much to drink , but they do n't think alcohol bans would help either . " the difficulty then is that these people are hounded out of public spaces and their problems simply continue behind closed doors , which means we can longer reach them , " said social worker ingo tuchel .

laws are already in place in parts of berlin as well as some other regions , and now police officials in cottbus say they need better guidelines on how to handle the drinkers . " this is a very unpleasant situation , and it 's not doing the city or its reputation any good , " said wieland eschenburg of cottbus ' city council .
he said the city council has been searching for a solution that would be effective over the long term . questioning the point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long had relaxed laws around public alcohol consumption others , however , are questioning the point of the restrictions . " banning things makes them more attractive so the kids get more of a kick , and how do you punish youngsters anyway ? " asked one city resident .
" wagging a finger and telling them off wo n't work . " another resident said a ban would be unfair : " most people come here for a beer after work and just want to hang out with their friends and talk about what kind of a day they 've had - if people do n't like it , tough luck . " but people feel threatened and the police are at a loss .
they believe an alcohol ban is the only answer . public support the proposal has met with widespread public support - almost every local shop owner dislikes the presence of the young people on the square . " they 're a terrible blot on the landscape - knocking back their alcohol in public , " said one .
" all that beer and mulled wine and then they start running riot and it ends up getting really noisy . " " first thing in the morning , we have sweep up the glass so it does n't ruin everyone 's tires , " says another .
" it 's dreadful what goes on here .
if the police want an alcohol ban , they should introduce one , not just talk about it but do it . " still , experts say that in legal terms , introducing an alcohol ban is far from straightforward . spandau 's solution several years ago , the berlin suburb of spandau faced a similar problem when gangs of drinkers started regularly meeting in the pedestrian zone .
an alcohol ban soon got rid of them , but today , the ban is no longer in place .
it had to be lifted for legal reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin district of spandau forbade drinking in public for a time meanwhile , the authorities in berlin 's prenzlauerberg neighborhood are trying a different strategy .
although alcoholics and homeless people hang out on most of the district 's squares , the residents do n't seem to be too bothered . it 's as though everyone has tacitly agreed to get along and the local council has no intention of getting tough . " i think that would be the wrong approach , and it would have to be done in a neighborly way in the same way other neighborhood conflicts are resolved , " said jens-holger kirchner of the prenzlauer berg district council .
" if that failed , we might consider increasing a police presence as a way of keeping the peace . " out of sight social workers at berlin 's treberhilfe outreach project are all too familiar with their clients ' alcohol problems . they know these people can get out of hand when they 've had too much to drink , but they do n't think alcohol bans would help either . " the difficulty then is that these people are hounded out of public spaces and their problems simply continue behind closed doors , which means we can longer reach them , " said social worker ingo tuchel .
" that can get very problematic . " but many people would prefer it that way - out of sight , out of mind . rupert wiederwald -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government to crack down on drunk driving with binge drinking gaining ground in germany , the german government is seeking to crack down on drunk driving among young people by imposing tough new laws including a zero-tolerance policy .

with no wins in four games , the arrival of title chasers stuttgart on saturday takes on a more serious tone . schalke 04 coach mirko slomka admitted on thursday he is wary of third-place stuttgart 's visit .
the team have seized the under-dog tag ahead of saturday 's clash against the bundesliga leaders . in the hunt for their first german title in 49 years , schalke 's form has deserted them - they have now gone four games without a win - and slomka knows his side desperately need a moral-boosting victory at the veltins arena . schalke are just three points ahead of second-placed werder bremen and are away to a resurgent fourth-placed bayern munich in two weeks - after the international break - in a game which could decide the identity of the 2007 bundesliga champions . schalke wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart routed schalke 3-0 earlier in the season " stuttgart are playing down the roll of title candidates , that 's a tactic i can understand from their point of view , " said slomka .
" the last time we played them , they won 3-0 , but we wo n't be using that as motivation .
the desire to maintain our league position will be incentive enough . " slomka was given a two-year extension to his current contract on thursday , but after losing their last two home games to bayern leverkusen and hamburg , his side need to stop leaking championship points . stuttgart are without bundesliga top-scorer mario gomez , who picked up a knee injury last weekend which will rules him out for six weeks .
but they are in good form , having only lost just once in eight games . fourth-placed bayern munich are hoping captain oliver kahn will be fit for saturday 's trip to relegation-contenders eintracht frankfurt . waiting for a schalke slip-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern hope the draw with bremen leads to greater things after veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld committed to another year at the helm on thursday , bayern are in buoyant mood following their 1-1 draw with bremen and are desperate to close the six-point gap between them and leaders schalke . having been anchored to the bottom of the table at christmas , tenth-placed mainz 05 face a huge test of their improved form when they travel to bremen on sunday . mainz are waiting on the fitness of their egyptian midfielder mohamad zidan who was sold from bremen for 2.8 million euros during the winter break and has been a revelation for his new club . the 25-year-old striker has bagged seven goals in seven games , but is battling flu in the race to face his former club . new relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll has to motivate a mutinous , underachieving team with his new club having suffered eight defeats in the last ten games , new borussia dortmund coach thomas doll has his work cut to stop the 1997 european champions sliding into the relegation zone , starting at home on saturday to nuremburg . dortmund are just one point from the relegation zone and after departing coach jürgen röber questioned the commitment of his squad , particularly german internationals christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl , bridges need to be rebuilt . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honors even as bayern and bremen draw in title clash bayern munich and werder bremen shared the points in the bundesliga clash of the titans sunday , drawing 1-1 in munich .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .
surrounded by cramped apartment buildings and busy streets , the landmark church is an oasis of calm - or rather it usually is . a voice droning out of the loudspeakers belongs to himesh reshamiyya , one of the most celebrated pop singers in india .
he plays the lead in the bollywood film " aap ka suroor , " which is currently being shot in germany . agnes church is one of the film 's locations .
the producers want to simulate a night-time concert in the huge nave and covered the windows and walls with black drapes . no prayers , lots of song and dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancer from " bollywood - the musical " in a place where believers usually kneel down to pray , there are now 50 professional dancers in silver sequined dresses shaking their hips while a few hundred extras mill around waiting to play the cheering crowd . vinod is one of them .
he was born in india but lives in germany .
and he is a big fan of reshamiyya .
for the 16-year-old , the shoot is a special chance to see his star at close range . " i knew of him before , but i never met him , " he said .
" it 's totally different to see him personally now .
i 'm standing in the fourth row .
it 's cool and i 'm having a lot of fun . " but having fun and dancing in a church has raised a few eyebrows .
cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle . " until sunday , only the film team will be allowed to use in the main nave , which has upset more than a few people . they do n't understand why she shoot has to take place in a building they consider holy . " this is not even a high-quality production , not an ambitious film which one could possibly stand being shot in a church , " says one man who lives nearby .
" i have talked to several people in the area and their enthusiasm is also limited .
people think the church is selling itself . " the exact sum which the film company paid to the church is not clear .
because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .
surrounded by cramped apartment buildings and busy streets , the landmark church is an oasis of calm - or rather it usually is . a voice droning out of the loudspeakers belongs to himesh reshamiyya , one of the most celebrated pop singers in india .
he plays the lead in the bollywood film " aap ka suroor , " which is currently being shot in germany . agnes church is one of the film 's locations .
the producers want to simulate a night-time concert in the huge nave and covered the windows and walls with black drapes . no prayers , lots of song and dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancer from " bollywood - the musical " in a place where believers usually kneel down to pray , there are now 50 professional dancers in silver sequined dresses shaking their hips while a few hundred extras mill around waiting to play the cheering crowd . vinod is one of them .
he was born in india but lives in germany .
and he is a big fan of reshamiyya .
for the 16-year-old , the shoot is a special chance to see his star at close range . " i knew of him before , but i never met him , " he said .
" it 's totally different to see him personally now .
i 'm standing in the fourth row .
it 's cool and i 'm having a lot of fun . " but having fun and dancing in a church has raised a few eyebrows .
cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle . " until sunday , only the film team will be allowed to use in the main nave , which has upset more than a few people . they do n't understand why she shoot has to take place in a building they consider holy . " this is not even a high-quality production , not an ambitious film which one could possibly stand being shot in a church , " says one man who lives nearby .
" i have talked to several people in the area and their enthusiasm is also limited .
people think the church is selling itself . " the exact sum which the film company paid to the church is not clear .
because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2007 at tech fair , experts say war against viruses could be lost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's getting harder to stay ahead of computer viruses the war against computer viruses may no longer be winnable , with criminals and espionage agencies spreading their attacks , experts are warning at the world 's biggest computing fair . " if the growth in malware continues at the current pace , makers of anti-virus software may not be able to withstand the onslaught , " said eugene kaspersky , the respected russian expert on computer security , in a speech at the cebit expo in hanover , germany . his company , kaspersky lab , offers a minute-by-minute update on its website as new malware - a broad term covering viruses , spam , phishing and other methods of taking control of digital devices without permission - is discovered . his finnish rival , f-secure , says that on a bad day , its servers receive from customers 40,000 copies of files suspected of evil intent . " how can we deal with this avalanche , " asked f-secure chief research officer mikko hypponen , whose company has developed software to not only pick out known malware but also to automatically hunt for software doing anything suspicious . " this is not just a battle between manufacturers of security software and some internet criminals .
it is a war between good and evil , " declared hypponen , who was recently credited by a us magazine as being one of the 50 most influential people on the internet . no one safe computer security experts have regularly warned down the years that no one is completely safe , even if anti-virus advertising suggests that consumers can rest easy if they buy such products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worms and other malicious pieces of code can easily get into computers at cebit , it is plain that there are leaks in the dykes built by kaspersky , f-secure and other anti-virus companies . for a start , there is the sheer size of the onslaught , with the volume of malware growing last year by a factor of 2.5 .
kaspersky predicts comparable growth in the course of this year . " i would propose a sort of internet interpol , he said , referring to the un organization where police swap wanted data .
soon , no single suite of security software may be able to cope in this " spooky arms race " against unseen attackers . another weak point on the good side is the innocence of humans , which attackers are learning to exploit in ever more devious ways . a new trick involves sending people what appears to be an everyday invoice , for example for their tv license , with an exaggerated amount .
that makes people angry , and anger makes it easier to believe the e-mail really comes from a public institution . they click on an attachment that appears to be a pdf file , a common format for sending printed documents with e-mail . unfortunately the file is really a trojan horse : a form of software that steals account details and passwords or creates a zombie computer that distributes spam under criminal control . " we are dealing more and more with a worldwide industry that employs thousands of people , ' said kaspersky .
" i would not be surprised if they had greater turnover than the total sales of the security-software sector . " lucrative field hypponen pointed out that a spammer can live comfortably if just one in a million spam mails scores a sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer crime comes with high costs malware packages are being freely offered for sale on the internet for several thousand dollars apiece and some suppliers will write malware to order .
cyber-criminals even offer for rent the squadrons of zombie computers they control . unwitting home and small office users are providing the actual computers , electricity and other costs . the kings of spam , believed to live in china , russia and latin america , allegedly earn millions of dollars from the practice .
in poor countries , the temptation to mount such profitable attacks is all the greater . " these people are paying programmers the kind of salary that i could never afford , ' says natalya kaspersky , chief executive of the kaspersky company .
that attracts talented young people to the " evil side . " hypponen says malware , formerly the domain of amateurs , has been dominated by criminals since 2003 .
since last year , the cutting-edge malware appears to have been the work of espionage agencies . software engineer kaspersky says he worries about campaigns to increase computer use in emerging and underdeveloped economies . " at the moment , practically none of the malware is coming from africa , " he said .
" if africans began to join in , the pressure would become enormous .
and suppose that just 1 per cent of china 's population developed into online criminals .
we would n't have a chance .

the team have seized the under-dog tag ahead of saturday 's clash against the bundesliga leaders . in the hunt for their first german title in 49 years , schalke 's form has deserted them - they have now gone four games without a win - and slomka knows his side desperately need a moral-boosting victory at the veltins arena . schalke are just three points ahead of second-placed werder bremen and are away to a resurgent fourth-placed bayern munich in two weeks - after the international break - in a game which could decide the identity of the 2007 bundesliga champions . schalke wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart routed schalke 3-0 earlier in the season " stuttgart are playing down the roll of title candidates , that 's a tactic i can understand from their point of view , " said slomka .

the desire to maintain our league position will be incentive enough . " slomka was given a two-year extension to his current contract on thursday , but after losing their last two home games to bayern leverkusen and hamburg , his side need to stop leaking championship points . stuttgart are without bundesliga top-scorer mario gomez , who picked up a knee injury last weekend which will rules him out for six weeks .

" if the growth in malware continues at the current pace , makers of anti-virus software may not be able to withstand the onslaught , " said eugene kaspersky , the respected russian expert on computer security , in a speech at the cebit expo in hanover , germany . his company , kaspersky lab , offers a minute-by-minute update on its website as new malware - a broad term covering viruses , spam , phishing and other methods of taking control of digital devices without permission - is discovered . his finnish rival , f-secure , says that on a bad day , its servers receive from customers 40,000 copies of files suspected of evil intent . " how can we deal with this avalanche , " asked f-secure chief research officer mikko hypponen , whose company has developed software to not only pick out known malware but also to automatically hunt for software doing anything suspicious . " this is not just a battle between manufacturers of security software and some internet criminals .
it is a war between good and evil , " declared hypponen , who was recently credited by a us magazine as being one of the 50 most influential people on the internet . no one safe computer security experts have regularly warned down the years that no one is completely safe , even if anti-virus advertising suggests that consumers can rest easy if they buy such products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worms and other malicious pieces of code can easily get into computers at cebit , it is plain that there are leaks in the dykes built by kaspersky , f-secure and other anti-virus companies . for a start , there is the sheer size of the onslaught , with the volume of malware growing last year by a factor of 2.5 .
kaspersky predicts comparable growth in the course of this year . " i would propose a sort of internet interpol , he said , referring to the un organization where police swap wanted data .
soon , no single suite of security software may be able to cope in this " spooky arms race " against unseen attackers . another weak point on the good side is the innocence of humans , which attackers are learning to exploit in ever more devious ways . a new trick involves sending people what appears to be an everyday invoice , for example for their tv license , with an exaggerated amount .
that makes people angry , and anger makes it easier to believe the e-mail really comes from a public institution . they click on an attachment that appears to be a pdf file , a common format for sending printed documents with e-mail . unfortunately the file is really a trojan horse : a form of software that steals account details and passwords or creates a zombie computer that distributes spam under criminal control . " we are dealing more and more with a worldwide industry that employs thousands of people , ' said kaspersky .
" i would not be surprised if they had greater turnover than the total sales of the security-software sector . " lucrative field hypponen pointed out that a spammer can live comfortably if just one in a million spam mails scores a sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer crime comes with high costs malware packages are being freely offered for sale on the internet for several thousand dollars apiece and some suppliers will write malware to order .
cyber-criminals even offer for rent the squadrons of zombie computers they control . unwitting home and small office users are providing the actual computers , electricity and other costs . the kings of spam , believed to live in china , russia and latin america , allegedly earn millions of dollars from the practice .
in poor countries , the temptation to mount such profitable attacks is all the greater . " these people are paying programmers the kind of salary that i could never afford , ' says natalya kaspersky , chief executive of the kaspersky company .
that attracts talented young people to the " evil side . " hypponen says malware , formerly the domain of amateurs , has been dominated by criminals since 2003 .
since last year , the cutting-edge malware appears to have been the work of espionage agencies . software engineer kaspersky says he worries about campaigns to increase computer use in emerging and underdeveloped economies . " at the moment , practically none of the malware is coming from africa , " he said .
" if africans began to join in , the pressure would become enormous .
and suppose that just 1 per cent of china 's population developed into online criminals .
we would n't have a chance .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .

because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2007 at tech fair , experts say war against viruses could be lost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's getting harder to stay ahead of computer viruses the war against computer viruses may no longer be winnable , with criminals and espionage agencies spreading their attacks , experts are warning at the world 's biggest computing fair . " if the growth in malware continues at the current pace , makers of anti-virus software may not be able to withstand the onslaught , " said eugene kaspersky , the respected russian expert on computer security , in a speech at the cebit expo in hanover , germany . his company , kaspersky lab , offers a minute-by-minute update on its website as new malware - a broad term covering viruses , spam , phishing and other methods of taking control of digital devices without permission - is discovered . his finnish rival , f-secure , says that on a bad day , its servers receive from customers 40,000 copies of files suspected of evil intent . " how can we deal with this avalanche , " asked f-secure chief research officer mikko hypponen , whose company has developed software to not only pick out known malware but also to automatically hunt for software doing anything suspicious . " this is not just a battle between manufacturers of security software and some internet criminals .
it is a war between good and evil , " declared hypponen , who was recently credited by a us magazine as being one of the 50 most influential people on the internet . no one safe computer security experts have regularly warned down the years that no one is completely safe , even if anti-virus advertising suggests that consumers can rest easy if they buy such products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worms and other malicious pieces of code can easily get into computers at cebit , it is plain that there are leaks in the dykes built by kaspersky , f-secure and other anti-virus companies . for a start , there is the sheer size of the onslaught , with the volume of malware growing last year by a factor of 2.5 .
kaspersky predicts comparable growth in the course of this year . " i would propose a sort of internet interpol , he said , referring to the un organization where police swap wanted data .
soon , no single suite of security software may be able to cope in this " spooky arms race " against unseen attackers . another weak point on the good side is the innocence of humans , which attackers are learning to exploit in ever more devious ways . a new trick involves sending people what appears to be an everyday invoice , for example for their tv license , with an exaggerated amount .
that makes people angry , and anger makes it easier to believe the e-mail really comes from a public institution . they click on an attachment that appears to be a pdf file , a common format for sending printed documents with e-mail . unfortunately the file is really a trojan horse : a form of software that steals account details and passwords or creates a zombie computer that distributes spam under criminal control .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .
surrounded by cramped apartment buildings and busy streets , the landmark church is an oasis of calm - or rather it usually is . a voice droning out of the loudspeakers belongs to himesh reshamiyya , one of the most celebrated pop singers in india .
he plays the lead in the bollywood film " aap ka suroor , " which is currently being shot in germany . agnes church is one of the film 's locations .
the producers want to simulate a night-time concert in the huge nave and covered the windows and walls with black drapes . no prayers , lots of song and dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancer from " bollywood - the musical " in a place where believers usually kneel down to pray , there are now 50 professional dancers in silver sequined dresses shaking their hips while a few hundred extras mill around waiting to play the cheering crowd . vinod is one of them .
he was born in india but lives in germany .
and he is a big fan of reshamiyya .
for the 16-year-old , the shoot is a special chance to see his star at close range . " i knew of him before , but i never met him , " he said .
" it 's totally different to see him personally now .
i 'm standing in the fourth row .
it 's cool and i 'm having a lot of fun . " but having fun and dancing in a church has raised a few eyebrows .
cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle . " until sunday , only the film team will be allowed to use in the main nave , which has upset more than a few people . they do n't understand why she shoot has to take place in a building they consider holy . " this is not even a high-quality production , not an ambitious film which one could possibly stand being shot in a church , " says one man who lives nearby .
" i have talked to several people in the area and their enthusiasm is also limited .
people think the church is selling itself . " the exact sum which the film company paid to the church is not clear .
because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2007 at tech fair , experts say war against viruses could be lost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's getting harder to stay ahead of computer viruses the war against computer viruses may no longer be winnable , with criminals and espionage agencies spreading their attacks , experts are warning at the world 's biggest computing fair . " if the growth in malware continues at the current pace , makers of anti-virus software may not be able to withstand the onslaught , " said eugene kaspersky , the respected russian expert on computer security , in a speech at the cebit expo in hanover , germany . his company , kaspersky lab , offers a minute-by-minute update on its website as new malware - a broad term covering viruses , spam , phishing and other methods of taking control of digital devices without permission - is discovered . his finnish rival , f-secure , says that on a bad day , its servers receive from customers 40,000 copies of files suspected of evil intent . " how can we deal with this avalanche , " asked f-secure chief research officer mikko hypponen , whose company has developed software to not only pick out known malware but also to automatically hunt for software doing anything suspicious . " this is not just a battle between manufacturers of security software and some internet criminals .
it is a war between good and evil , " declared hypponen , who was recently credited by a us magazine as being one of the 50 most influential people on the internet . no one safe computer security experts have regularly warned down the years that no one is completely safe , even if anti-virus advertising suggests that consumers can rest easy if they buy such products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worms and other malicious pieces of code can easily get into computers at cebit , it is plain that there are leaks in the dykes built by kaspersky , f-secure and other anti-virus companies . for a start , there is the sheer size of the onslaught , with the volume of malware growing last year by a factor of 2.5 .
kaspersky predicts comparable growth in the course of this year . " i would propose a sort of internet interpol , he said , referring to the un organization where police swap wanted data .
soon , no single suite of security software may be able to cope in this " spooky arms race " against unseen attackers . another weak point on the good side is the innocence of humans , which attackers are learning to exploit in ever more devious ways . a new trick involves sending people what appears to be an everyday invoice , for example for their tv license , with an exaggerated amount .
that makes people angry , and anger makes it easier to believe the e-mail really comes from a public institution . they click on an attachment that appears to be a pdf file , a common format for sending printed documents with e-mail . unfortunately the file is really a trojan horse : a form of software that steals account details and passwords or creates a zombie computer that distributes spam under criminal control . " we are dealing more and more with a worldwide industry that employs thousands of people , ' said kaspersky .
" i would not be surprised if they had greater turnover than the total sales of the security-software sector . " lucrative field hypponen pointed out that a spammer can live comfortably if just one in a million spam mails scores a sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer crime comes with high costs malware packages are being freely offered for sale on the internet for several thousand dollars apiece and some suppliers will write malware to order .
cyber-criminals even offer for rent the squadrons of zombie computers they control . unwitting home and small office users are providing the actual computers , electricity and other costs . the kings of spam , believed to live in china , russia and latin america , allegedly earn millions of dollars from the practice .
in poor countries , the temptation to mount such profitable attacks is all the greater . " these people are paying programmers the kind of salary that i could never afford , ' says natalya kaspersky , chief executive of the kaspersky company .
that attracts talented young people to the " evil side . " hypponen says malware , formerly the domain of amateurs , has been dominated by criminals since 2003 .
since last year , the cutting-edge malware appears to have been the work of espionage agencies . software engineer kaspersky says he worries about campaigns to increase computer use in emerging and underdeveloped economies . " at the moment , practically none of the malware is coming from africa , " he said .
" if africans began to join in , the pressure would become enormous .
and suppose that just 1 per cent of china 's population developed into online criminals .
we would n't have a chance .

while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol . every afternoon , dozens of young drinkers gather on the square in central cottbus , after work , after school or after a day just hanging out at home .
and the more they drink , the more aggressive they become toward shoppers passing by .
in the past year , police have been called on to intervene about 140 times . as a result , the eastern german city wants to introduce a ban on street drinking .
laws are already in place in parts of berlin as well as some other regions , and now police officials in cottbus say they need better guidelines on how to handle the drinkers . " this is a very unpleasant situation , and it 's not doing the city or its reputation any good , " said wieland eschenburg of cottbus ' city council .
he said the city council has been searching for a solution that would be effective over the long term . questioning the point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long had relaxed laws around public alcohol consumption others , however , are questioning the point of the restrictions . " banning things makes them more attractive so the kids get more of a kick , and how do you punish youngsters anyway ? " asked one city resident .
" wagging a finger and telling them off wo n't work .

the team have seized the under-dog tag ahead of saturday 's clash against the bundesliga leaders . in the hunt for their first german title in 49 years , schalke 's form has deserted them - they have now gone four games without a win - and slomka knows his side desperately need a moral-boosting victory at the veltins arena . schalke are just three points ahead of second-placed werder bremen and are away to a resurgent fourth-placed bayern munich in two weeks - after the international break - in a game which could decide the identity of the 2007 bundesliga champions . schalke wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart routed schalke 3-0 earlier in the season " stuttgart are playing down the roll of title candidates , that 's a tactic i can understand from their point of view , " said slomka .
" the last time we played them , they won 3-0 , but we wo n't be using that as motivation .
the desire to maintain our league position will be incentive enough . " slomka was given a two-year extension to his current contract on thursday , but after losing their last two home games to bayern leverkusen and hamburg , his side need to stop leaking championship points . stuttgart are without bundesliga top-scorer mario gomez , who picked up a knee injury last weekend which will rules him out for six weeks .
but they are in good form , having only lost just once in eight games . fourth-placed bayern munich are hoping captain oliver kahn will be fit for saturday 's trip to relegation-contenders eintracht frankfurt . waiting for a schalke slip-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern hope the draw with bremen leads to greater things after veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld committed to another year at the helm on thursday , bayern are in buoyant mood following their 1-1 draw with bremen and are desperate to close the six-point gap between them and leaders schalke . having been anchored to the bottom of the table at christmas , tenth-placed mainz 05 face a huge test of their improved form when they travel to bremen on sunday . mainz are waiting on the fitness of their egyptian midfielder mohamad zidan who was sold from bremen for 2.8 million euros during the winter break and has been a revelation for his new club . the 25-year-old striker has bagged seven goals in seven games , but is battling flu in the race to face his former club . new relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll has to motivate a mutinous , underachieving team with his new club having suffered eight defeats in the last ten games , new borussia dortmund coach thomas doll has his work cut to stop the 1997 european champions sliding into the relegation zone , starting at home on saturday to nuremburg . dortmund are just one point from the relegation zone and after departing coach jürgen röber questioned the commitment of his squad , particularly german internationals christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl , bridges need to be rebuilt . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honors even as bayern and bremen draw in title clash bayern munich and werder bremen shared the points in the bundesliga clash of the titans sunday , drawing 1-1 in munich .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .
surrounded by cramped apartment buildings and busy streets , the landmark church is an oasis of calm - or rather it usually is . a voice droning out of the loudspeakers belongs to himesh reshamiyya , one of the most celebrated pop singers in india .
he plays the lead in the bollywood film " aap ka suroor , " which is currently being shot in germany . agnes church is one of the film 's locations .

he was born in india but lives in germany .

for the 16-year-old , the shoot is a special chance to see his star at close range . " i knew of him before , but i never met him , " he said .
" it 's totally different to see him personally now .
i 'm standing in the fourth row .
it 's cool and i 'm having a lot of fun . " but having fun and dancing in a church has raised a few eyebrows .
cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle . " until sunday , only the film team will be allowed to use in the main nave , which has upset more than a few people . they do n't understand why she shoot has to take place in a building they consider holy .

" i have talked to several people in the area and their enthusiasm is also limited .
people think the church is selling itself . " the exact sum which the film company paid to the church is not clear .
because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

the cult indian films have made it onto german cinema and television screens and have a huge following among german cinema fans longing for the cinematic pomp and pomposity of a bygone era . but indian filmmakers have also discovered europe offers prime locations for shooting .
while they have already ventured to scenic spots in the alps , one indian film company is currently shooting its latest film in the german city of cologne , which has not been to everyone 's taste . the agnes church is one of cologne 's biggest sacred buildings .
its gothic steeple rises up to the sky .
surrounded by cramped apartment buildings and busy streets , the landmark church is an oasis of calm - or rather it usually is . a voice droning out of the loudspeakers belongs to himesh reshamiyya , one of the most celebrated pop singers in india .
he plays the lead in the bollywood film " aap ka suroor , " which is currently being shot in germany . agnes church is one of the film 's locations .
the producers want to simulate a night-time concert in the huge nave and covered the windows and walls with black drapes . no prayers , lots of song and dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancer from " bollywood - the musical " in a place where believers usually kneel down to pray , there are now 50 professional dancers in silver sequined dresses shaking their hips while a few hundred extras mill around waiting to play the cheering crowd . vinod is one of them .
he was born in india but lives in germany .
and he is a big fan of reshamiyya .
for the 16-year-old , the shoot is a special chance to see his star at close range . " i knew of him before , but i never met him , " he said .
" it 's totally different to see him personally now .
i 'm standing in the fourth row .
it 's cool and i 'm having a lot of fun . " but having fun and dancing in a church has raised a few eyebrows .
cologne 's archbishop joachim meissner tried to stop the shooting from going ahead , but failed when it was revealed the church 's pastor had already signed the contract with the production company . bildunterschrift : church accused of selling out many parishioners are angry about the production .
an elderly woman shakes her head as she enters the church and then turns to leave saying : " i wanted to pray , to light a candle . " until sunday , only the film team will be allowed to use in the main nave , which has upset more than a few people . they do n't understand why she shoot has to take place in a building they consider holy . " this is not even a high-quality production , not an ambitious film which one could possibly stand being shot in a church , " says one man who lives nearby .
" i have talked to several people in the area and their enthusiasm is also limited .
people think the church is selling itself . " the exact sum which the film company paid to the church is not clear .
because of the controversy and for fear of jeopardizing the shoot , reshamiyya and the film company decided to cancel all interviews and closed off the church to the public . hence , not much information about the film 's plot was made available , besides that it will partly be about reshamiyya 's life and that it will be a typical bollywood film - lots of music , dance , love and the inevitable happy end . the film will hit india 's screens in july . barbara mohr -lrb- nha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood .

" if the growth in malware continues at the current pace , makers of anti-virus software may not be able to withstand the onslaught , " said eugene kaspersky , the respected russian expert on computer security , in a speech at the cebit expo in hanover , germany . his company , kaspersky lab , offers a minute-by-minute update on its website as new malware - a broad term covering viruses , spam , phishing and other methods of taking control of digital devices without permission - is discovered . his finnish rival , f-secure , says that on a bad day , its servers receive from customers 40,000 copies of files suspected of evil intent . " how can we deal with this avalanche , " asked f-secure chief research officer mikko hypponen , whose company has developed software to not only pick out known malware but also to automatically hunt for software doing anything suspicious . " this is not just a battle between manufacturers of security software and some internet criminals .
it is a war between good and evil , " declared hypponen , who was recently credited by a us magazine as being one of the 50 most influential people on the internet . no one safe computer security experts have regularly warned down the years that no one is completely safe , even if anti-virus advertising suggests that consumers can rest easy if they buy such products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worms and other malicious pieces of code can easily get into computers at cebit , it is plain that there are leaks in the dykes built by kaspersky , f-secure and other anti-virus companies . for a start , there is the sheer size of the onslaught , with the volume of malware growing last year by a factor of 2.5 .
kaspersky predicts comparable growth in the course of this year . " i would propose a sort of internet interpol , he said , referring to the un organization where police swap wanted data .
soon , no single suite of security software may be able to cope in this " spooky arms race " against unseen attackers . another weak point on the good side is the innocence of humans , which attackers are learning to exploit in ever more devious ways . a new trick involves sending people what appears to be an everyday invoice , for example for their tv license , with an exaggerated amount .
that makes people angry , and anger makes it easier to believe the e-mail really comes from a public institution . they click on an attachment that appears to be a pdf file , a common format for sending printed documents with e-mail . unfortunately the file is really a trojan horse : a form of software that steals account details and passwords or creates a zombie computer that distributes spam under criminal control . " we are dealing more and more with a worldwide industry that employs thousands of people , ' said kaspersky .
" i would not be surprised if they had greater turnover than the total sales of the security-software sector .

cyber-criminals even offer for rent the squadrons of zombie computers they control . unwitting home and small office users are providing the actual computers , electricity and other costs . the kings of spam , believed to live in china , russia and latin america , allegedly earn millions of dollars from the practice .
in poor countries , the temptation to mount such profitable attacks is all the greater . " these people are paying programmers the kind of salary that i could never afford , ' says natalya kaspersky , chief executive of the kaspersky company .

while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol . every afternoon , dozens of young drinkers gather on the square in central cottbus , after work , after school or after a day just hanging out at home .
and the more they drink , the more aggressive they become toward shoppers passing by .

laws are already in place in parts of berlin as well as some other regions , and now police officials in cottbus say they need better guidelines on how to handle the drinkers . " this is a very unpleasant situation , and it 's not doing the city or its reputation any good , " said wieland eschenburg of cottbus ' city council .

" banning things makes them more attractive so the kids get more of a kick , and how do you punish youngsters anyway ? " asked one city resident .
" wagging a finger and telling them off wo n't work . " another resident said a ban would be unfair : " most people come here for a beer after work and just want to hang out with their friends and talk about what kind of a day they 've had - if people do n't like it , tough luck .

picturing 9/11 dw-world : the " zen " of berlin : concentration and culture-shock dw-world : the suffering of “ others ” dw-world : memory , one piece at a time student correspondents -pipe- 17.03.2007 at least there 's no gunfire or tourists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joel karlsberg likes cloudy , drizzly days joel karlsberg does n't exactly live in an upscale neighborhood , but he ca n't complain about run-down , working-class braunschweig . i don ’ t live in the best part of town .
but before i go any further , let ’ s put things into perspective . one summer in the states i lived with a friend in a rather low-income -lrb- but actually still quite nice ! -rrb- part of town .
on most warm evenings , i could sit at my desk with the window open and hear the semi-automatic gunfire ringing out across the neighborhood . it was a bit annoying at first , since i had a lot of studying to do that summer , but i got used to it , and even lived in the same house again the next summer .
places like that don ’ t really exist in germany .
as a matter of fact , i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever heard a gunshot in germany . you wo n't find pyromaniacs here we also can ’ t compare my neighborhood with a burning parisian banlieue full of misguided and shunned african immigrant youth taking out their pyromaniacal frustrations on a bunch of completely innocent parked cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunschweig has a few nice areas too , but joel does n't live there and we most certainly aren ’ t going to even try to compare my block with the council estates in the uk that the breathless tabloids across the channel are so fond of describing as “ crime ridden . ” despite the allegedly scary conditions in some council estates , i take with a huge grain of salt anything written in a newspaper that also prints excerpts from coleen mclaughlin ’ s autobiography .
i mean seriously , she was born in 1986 . so we ’ ve established that a bad part of town in germany is nothing compared to a bad part of town in the us , or even elsewhere in europe .
this much is true . germany has worse neighborhoods i also suppose that since i don ’ t live in a huge , teeming city like berlin or hamburg , my run-down neighborhood can ’ t even compare to the 16-story , low-income berlin wohnblock described in german rapper sido ’ s recent hit “ mein block . ”
the enlightening video and accompanying song are readily available on a certain video hosting website you may have heard of . and yes , the most destitute parts of germany are still to be found in more rural sections of the former east , where unemployment as high as 19 percent leads the few youths who haven ’ t yet left for the west to either join the far-right nationalist npd party or the far-left gorby-was-better-than-this pds . in any case , i do live in a slightly well-worn quarter .
perhaps it might be best to begin with the city as a whole .
i ’ ve always suspected it has something to do with the name -lrb- or license plate abbreviation , as mentioned last week -rrb- , but braunschweig is not known for its beauty . warning : braunschweig 's not pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joel does n't live in braunschweig 's rizzi house either that may be the reason that i have not once come across any english-speaking tourists here .
i don ’ t read tourist guidebooks , but i would assume braunschweig constitutes a footnote , or perhaps a warning , set beside an exclamation point inside a triangle : “ caution !
avoid !
smokestacks and postwar architecture ! ” sure , there might not be any north sea -lrb- or even baltic sea -rrb- or alps -lrb- or hills at all -rrb- here , and the city was so thoroughly destroyed during the war that very little historic architecture remains .
and yet braunschweig has its own charm .
granted , it ’ s taken me a few months of living here to appreciate it , but the run-down , working-class aura of the place is delightfully unpretentious and altogether quite comfortable . after having spent a year living in munich , i also rather appreciate the absence of camera-toting hordes who follow their guidebooks from one trite tourist attraction to the next and don ’ t try to speak german or see anything of value . singing in the rain as for the weather here in braunschweig , which is basically a continually varying shade of grey , i grew up in the pacific northwest , and i find nothing as invigorating and cheerful as a cloudy , breezy , drizzly day .
no , i ’ m serious . so i guess we get along all right for now , this city and i. i ’ ll discuss braunschweig and my neighborhood more specifically in next week 's column . joel karlsberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read joel karlsberg 's earlier columns dw-world : can i see your license sir ?

the candidate caves are on the flanks of the arsia mons volcano and are of sufficient depth their floors mostly can not be seen through the opening .
details were presented here at the lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas .
temperature data from mars odyssey 's themis instrument support the idea .
the authors say that the possible discovery of caves on the red planet is significant .
the caves may be the only natural structures capable of protecting primitive life forms from micrometeoroids , uv radiation , solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet 's surface .
the spacecraft spotted what seemed to be vertical " skylight " entrances to caves below the surface .
there is a sheer drop of between about 80m and 130m or more to the cave floors below .
' seven sisters ' during the day , one of the features - nicknamed " annie " - is warmer than surrounding pits and cooler than sunlit areas .
night time temperatures are warmer than nearly all surrounding areas .
co-author glen cushing , from the us geological survey in flagstaff , arizona , said this was exactly what would be expected if the feature were a cave .
" nothing like these features has been seen elsewhere on mars , " he told bbc news .
the researchers describe the candidate caves as " seven sisters " and have given them all names : dena , chloe , wendy , annie , abbey , nicki and jeanne .
the cave entrances are between 100m and 252m wide -lrb- 330-828ft -rrb- .
because in most cases the cave floors can not be seen , only minimum depths are known : the researchers calculated they must extend between 73m and 96m -lrb- 240-315ft -rrb- below the surface .
however , in one image taken of dena by the mars odyssey camera , a floor can be seen .
using the data , the authors calculated that this cave must extend 130m -lrb- 426ft -rrb- below the surface .
mars odyssey was launched in april 2001 to hunt for past or present water on the red planet .
its themis -lrb- thermal emission imaging system -rrb- instrument uses the visible and infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum to measure the temperature properties of the martian surface .

it was carried out for the executive by the director of football studies at glasgow university , bert moorhouse .
in a statement , the executive denied that it " in any way tried to delay or suppress publication of this report " .
football phone-in mr moorhouse said it should have been published last year but his work was withheld .
he said : " i was n't pleased that my report was not published .
" i was told the day before it was not published that it was not being published .
" i feel the report has been very badly handled by the scottish executive . "
the report has seen the light of day now because the scottish sun has obtained it under the freedom of information act .
the paper claims that officers who support rangers or celtic are accused of taunting fans of other clubs .
police are also said to turn a blind eye to old firm fans ' sectarianism .
strathclyde police said the document was no more academic than a football phone-in .
