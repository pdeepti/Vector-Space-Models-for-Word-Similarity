despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems . " there need to be control mechanisms in place , so that life-saving medication that has been sold cheaply in africa does not wind up being resold in europe at a much higher price , with only the profiteers benefiting , " said preissner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "

western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .

according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .

merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .
they were kept away from the venue of the asem meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leftists target eu-asia meeting in preparation for g8 demos thousands of leftist radicals from several european nations demonstrated monday in hamburg against the european union in what they said was a curtain-raiser to protests at this year 's g8 summit .

" we regret that it has been hard to reach agreement with the us administration , but now we are delighted that there is a wide-ranging public debate about the issue in america , " gabriel said on monday after holding talks with us house of representatives leader nancy pelosi in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi , right , and sigmar gabriel " i believe germany 's policy on climate change is the right one , " he said .
" we want to take concrete steps forward . "
the us democratic party leader , who is an outspoken critic of president george w. bush , was in berlin on the first stop of a european tour , accompanied by a delegation of high-ranking democratic and republican politicians .
" this trip for us began in greenland where we saw first-hand evidence that climate change is a reality , " pelosi said at a press conference .
" there is just no denying it . "
" i hope that we can all assume our responsibilities with great respect and that our administration will be open to listening to why it is important to go forward , perhaps in a different way than we have proceeded in the past , " she said .
global danger since democrats took over congress in january , both the house and senate have proposed to push the nation more aggressively to reduce carbon emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has so far refused to sign the kyoto agreement on greenhouse emissions leaked documents , however , have shown that washington is raising strong objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts for the june 6-8 summit of the leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
pelosi declined to say whether washington would sign up to the german proposal of limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" first we have to have a fundamental agreement as to what the challenges and possibilities are for reaching such a goal , " she said .
" the science is clear , the challenge is undeniable , we have to work together though to reach a solution . "
" all of us are committed to finding the best possible science and workable solutions to the challenges we face . "
german leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is ademant about fighting global warming pelosi said she would thank chancellor angela merkel for her " leadership " on the climate change issue when they meet on tuesday .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .

a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .

under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .
president seen as a failure by many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko has failed on his promises , some say in the eyes of many ukrainians , pro-western yushchenko has failed to live up to his promises of a bright economic future and international integration made during the orange revolution in 2004 .
a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .
international powers , including ukraine 's giant neighbours russia and the european union , have expressed concern at the crisis and urged both sides to refrain from any use of violence . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine crisis abates with plans for new elections in september ukraine 's sparring political parties agreed to a date for fresh parliamentary elections early sunday in a breakthrough hailed by both sides as an end to their feud , and the threat of military confrontation in kiev .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .

d 'hont 's startling admissions in his recently-published book have led to a string of confessions from senior figures in the sport which have tarnished cycling 's image .
and ullrich , 33 , who won the 1997 tour de france , remains silent despite being suspected of using epo since he was implicated in the spanish doping investigation ' operation puerto ' which first engulfed the sport in may 2006 .
" it would be good for jan if he also made a clean sweep of the truth .
then his conscience would be clear " , d 'hont told german paper bild am sonntag .

but former cyclist rolf aldag , current manager of the t-mobile team which succeeded telekom - who has also confessed he had taken epo - agreed ullrich must come clean .
" whatever it is , the truth is the best .
if he has only told the truth up till now , fine , but he should say what he has done , " aldag also told bild am sonntag .
but ullrich seems to disagree and his manager , wolfgang strohband , was staying silent on the subject .
" we have nothing to say to the thing , " said strohband .

" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.05.2007 the battle between patents and patients to ease aids suffering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority who test hiv positive are african , and only 28 percent get treatment pharmaceuticals have an imperative beyond the profit motive , since they are in the business of saving lives .
despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems . " there need to be control mechanisms in place , so that life-saving medication that has been sold cheaply in africa does not wind up being resold in europe at a much higher price , with only the profiteers benefiting , " said preissner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe .

despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .

abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best actress jeon do-yeon instead best actor went to konstantin lavronenko , the lead of a bleak russian look at broken families , " the banishment " -lrb- the prize collected by the film 's director andrei zviaguintsev , right , on his behalf -rrb- , while south korea 's jeon do-yeon , playing a grief-struck woman wrestling with tragedy and faith in " secret sunshine " , picked up best actress .
" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .
president seen as a failure by many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko has failed on his promises , some say in the eyes of many ukrainians , pro-western yushchenko has failed to live up to his promises of a bright economic future and international integration made during the orange revolution in 2004 .
a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .
international powers , including ukraine 's giant neighbours russia and the european union , have expressed concern at the crisis and urged both sides to refrain from any use of violence . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine crisis abates with plans for new elections in september ukraine 's sparring political parties agreed to a date for fresh parliamentary elections early sunday in a breakthrough hailed by both sides as an end to their feud , and the threat of military confrontation in kiev .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .
4 to july 22 . akp leading polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union observers are keeping a close eye on the turkish electoral process recent public opinion surveys show that after four and a half years in power , the akp is still turkey 's most popular party , leading its rivals in the badly fractured opposition by a wide margin . the akp has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to secularism and carried out reforms that stabilized the economy and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but its opponents say it still harbors islamist ambitions , pointing at akp opposition to a headscarf ban in universities and public offices , its encouragement of religious schools and a failed attempt to restrict alcohol sales . sezer 's seven-year term expired on may 16 and he is currently serving as acting head of state . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy tackles turkey question during diplomatic tour on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven .

" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .

his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven .

" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .
president seen as a failure by many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko has failed on his promises , some say in the eyes of many ukrainians , pro-western yushchenko has failed to live up to his promises of a bright economic future and international integration made during the orange revolution in 2004 .
a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .
international powers , including ukraine 's giant neighbours russia and the european union , have expressed concern at the crisis and urged both sides to refrain from any use of violence . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine crisis abates with plans for new elections in september ukraine 's sparring political parties agreed to a date for fresh parliamentary elections early sunday in a breakthrough hailed by both sides as an end to their feud , and the threat of military confrontation in kiev .

despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems . " there need to be control mechanisms in place , so that life-saving medication that has been sold cheaply in africa does not wind up being resold in europe at a much higher price , with only the profiteers benefiting , " said preissner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.05.2007 europe seeks to pressure china at eu-asia meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi european foreign ministers will confront china over kosovo , the darfur conflict and its tacit support for myanmar at a major eu-asia meeting which began in hamburg on monday , diplomats said . " ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "

despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems . " there need to be control mechanisms in place , so that life-saving medication that has been sold cheaply in africa does not wind up being resold in europe at a much higher price , with only the profiteers benefiting , " said preissner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe .

despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .

despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems . " there need to be control mechanisms in place , so that life-saving medication that has been sold cheaply in africa does not wind up being resold in europe at a much higher price , with only the profiteers benefiting , " said preissner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .
they were kept away from the venue of the asem meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leftists target eu-asia meeting in preparation for g8 demos thousands of leftist radicals from several european nations demonstrated monday in hamburg against the european union in what they said was a curtain-raiser to protests at this year 's g8 summit .

pelosi declined to say whether washington would sign up to the german proposal of limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best actress jeon do-yeon instead best actor went to konstantin lavronenko , the lead of a bleak russian look at broken families , " the banishment " -lrb- the prize collected by the film 's director andrei zviaguintsev , right , on his behalf -rrb- , while south korea 's jeon do-yeon , playing a grief-struck woman wrestling with tragedy and faith in " secret sunshine " , picked up best actress .
" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .
michael moore 's new documentary " sicko " tackled the deficiencies of the us health system and " a mighty heart " starring angelina jolie as the widow of daniel pearl , remembered the wall street journal reporter decapitated by islamic extremists in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannes films come to poor parisian suburbs for the first time , the cannes festival ’ s top films won ’ t be screened exclusively in the beach town .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven .

it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .

" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .

despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .

a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .
president seen as a failure by many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko has failed on his promises , some say in the eyes of many ukrainians , pro-western yushchenko has failed to live up to his promises of a bright economic future and international integration made during the orange revolution in 2004 .
a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .

" this trip for us began in greenland where we saw first-hand evidence that climate change is a reality , " pelosi said at a press conference .

d 'hont 's startling admissions in his recently-published book have led to a string of confessions from senior figures in the sport which have tarnished cycling 's image .
and ullrich , 33 , who won the 1997 tour de france , remains silent despite being suspected of using epo since he was implicated in the spanish doping investigation ' operation puerto ' which first engulfed the sport in may 2006 .
" it would be good for jan if he also made a clean sweep of the truth .

but former cyclist rolf aldag , current manager of the t-mobile team which succeeded telekom - who has also confessed he had taken epo - agreed ullrich must come clean .
" whatever it is , the truth is the best .
if he has only told the truth up till now , fine , but he should say what he has done , " aldag also told bild am sonntag .
but ullrich seems to disagree and his manager , wolfgang strohband , was staying silent on the subject .

despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.05.2007 europe seeks to pressure china at eu-asia meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi european foreign ministers will confront china over kosovo , the darfur conflict and its tacit support for myanmar at a major eu-asia meeting which began in hamburg on monday , diplomats said . " ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "

western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "

french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .

according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .

" we want to take concrete steps forward . "
the us democratic party leader , who is an outspoken critic of president george w. bush , was in berlin on the first stop of a european tour , accompanied by a delegation of high-ranking democratic and republican politicians .
" this trip for us began in greenland where we saw first-hand evidence that climate change is a reality , " pelosi said at a press conference .
" there is just no denying it . "
" i hope that we can all assume our responsibilities with great respect and that our administration will be open to listening to why it is important to go forward , perhaps in a different way than we have proceeded in the past , " she said .
global danger since democrats took over congress in january , both the house and senate have proposed to push the nation more aggressively to reduce carbon emissions .

pelosi declined to say whether washington would sign up to the german proposal of limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" first we have to have a fundamental agreement as to what the challenges and possibilities are for reaching such a goal , " she said .
" the science is clear , the challenge is undeniable , we have to work together though to reach a solution . "
" all of us are committed to finding the best possible science and workable solutions to the challenges we face . "
german leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is ademant about fighting global warming pelosi said she would thank chancellor angela merkel for her " leadership " on the climate change issue when they meet on tuesday .
but in another sign of the obstacles facing germany , india , which has been invited to participate at heiligendamm , said monday it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions because stricter restrictions would slow its booming economy .
gabriel said developing nations like china and india could only be persuaded to commit to climate change restrictions if the most industrial nations such as germany and the united states led the way .
" we must take joint responsibility , " the minister said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us on collision course with g8 partners over climate agreement the prospect looms of a major clash between the united states and its g8 partners over global warming , with washington 's view threatening to block agreement at next month 's summit of the leading industrial nations .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .

despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .

another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven .

" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

" we regret that it has been hard to reach agreement with the us administration , but now we are delighted that there is a wide-ranging public debate about the issue in america , " gabriel said on monday after holding talks with us house of representatives leader nancy pelosi in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi , right , and sigmar gabriel " i believe germany 's policy on climate change is the right one , " he said .
" we want to take concrete steps forward . "
the us democratic party leader , who is an outspoken critic of president george w. bush , was in berlin on the first stop of a european tour , accompanied by a delegation of high-ranking democratic and republican politicians .
" this trip for us began in greenland where we saw first-hand evidence that climate change is a reality , " pelosi said at a press conference .
" there is just no denying it . "
" i hope that we can all assume our responsibilities with great respect and that our administration will be open to listening to why it is important to go forward , perhaps in a different way than we have proceeded in the past , " she said .
global danger since democrats took over congress in january , both the house and senate have proposed to push the nation more aggressively to reduce carbon emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has so far refused to sign the kyoto agreement on greenhouse emissions leaked documents , however , have shown that washington is raising strong objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts for the june 6-8 summit of the leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
pelosi declined to say whether washington would sign up to the german proposal of limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" first we have to have a fundamental agreement as to what the challenges and possibilities are for reaching such a goal , " she said .
" the science is clear , the challenge is undeniable , we have to work together though to reach a solution . "
" all of us are committed to finding the best possible science and workable solutions to the challenges we face . "
german leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is ademant about fighting global warming pelosi said she would thank chancellor angela merkel for her " leadership " on the climate change issue when they meet on tuesday .
but in another sign of the obstacles facing germany , india , which has been invited to participate at heiligendamm , said monday it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions because stricter restrictions would slow its booming economy .
gabriel said developing nations like china and india could only be persuaded to commit to climate change restrictions if the most industrial nations such as germany and the united states led the way .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .
4 to july 22 . akp leading polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union observers are keeping a close eye on the turkish electoral process recent public opinion surveys show that after four and a half years in power , the akp is still turkey 's most popular party , leading its rivals in the badly fractured opposition by a wide margin . the akp has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to secularism and carried out reforms that stabilized the economy and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but its opponents say it still harbors islamist ambitions , pointing at akp opposition to a headscarf ban in universities and public offices , its encouragement of religious schools and a failed attempt to restrict alcohol sales . sezer 's seven-year term expired on may 16 and he is currently serving as acting head of state . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy tackles turkey question during diplomatic tour on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .

the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

" we regret that it has been hard to reach agreement with the us administration , but now we are delighted that there is a wide-ranging public debate about the issue in america , " gabriel said on monday after holding talks with us house of representatives leader nancy pelosi in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi , right , and sigmar gabriel " i believe germany 's policy on climate change is the right one , " he said .
" we want to take concrete steps forward . "
the us democratic party leader , who is an outspoken critic of president george w. bush , was in berlin on the first stop of a european tour , accompanied by a delegation of high-ranking democratic and republican politicians .
" this trip for us began in greenland where we saw first-hand evidence that climate change is a reality , " pelosi said at a press conference .
" there is just no denying it . "
" i hope that we can all assume our responsibilities with great respect and that our administration will be open to listening to why it is important to go forward , perhaps in a different way than we have proceeded in the past , " she said .
global danger since democrats took over congress in january , both the house and senate have proposed to push the nation more aggressively to reduce carbon emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has so far refused to sign the kyoto agreement on greenhouse emissions leaked documents , however , have shown that washington is raising strong objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts for the june 6-8 summit of the leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
pelosi declined to say whether washington would sign up to the german proposal of limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" first we have to have a fundamental agreement as to what the challenges and possibilities are for reaching such a goal , " she said .
" the science is clear , the challenge is undeniable , we have to work together though to reach a solution . "
" all of us are committed to finding the best possible science and workable solutions to the challenges we face . "
german leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is ademant about fighting global warming pelosi said she would thank chancellor angela merkel for her " leadership " on the climate change issue when they meet on tuesday .
but in another sign of the obstacles facing germany , india , which has been invited to participate at heiligendamm , said monday it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions because stricter restrictions would slow its booming economy .
gabriel said developing nations like china and india could only be persuaded to commit to climate change restrictions if the most industrial nations such as germany and the united states led the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.05.2007 europe seeks to pressure china at eu-asia meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi european foreign ministers will confront china over kosovo , the darfur conflict and its tacit support for myanmar at a major eu-asia meeting which began in hamburg on monday , diplomats said . " ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .
they were kept away from the venue of the asem meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leftists target eu-asia meeting in preparation for g8 demos thousands of leftist radicals from several european nations demonstrated monday in hamburg against the european union in what they said was a curtain-raiser to protests at this year 's g8 summit .

third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .

picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven .

" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .
they were kept away from the venue of the asem meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leftists target eu-asia meeting in preparation for g8 demos thousands of leftist radicals from several european nations demonstrated monday in hamburg against the european union in what they said was a curtain-raiser to protests at this year 's g8 summit .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .

a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .
4 to july 22 . akp leading polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union observers are keeping a close eye on the turkish electoral process recent public opinion surveys show that after four and a half years in power , the akp is still turkey 's most popular party , leading its rivals in the badly fractured opposition by a wide margin . the akp has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to secularism and carried out reforms that stabilized the economy and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but its opponents say it still harbors islamist ambitions , pointing at akp opposition to a headscarf ban in universities and public offices , its encouragement of religious schools and a failed attempt to restrict alcohol sales . sezer 's seven-year term expired on may 16 and he is currently serving as acting head of state . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy tackles turkey question during diplomatic tour on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.05.2007 europe seeks to pressure china at eu-asia meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi european foreign ministers will confront china over kosovo , the darfur conflict and its tacit support for myanmar at a major eu-asia meeting which began in hamburg on monday , diplomats said . " ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .

" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven .

" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .
president seen as a failure by many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko has failed on his promises , some say in the eyes of many ukrainians , pro-western yushchenko has failed to live up to his promises of a bright economic future and international integration made during the orange revolution in 2004 .
a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .
international powers , including ukraine 's giant neighbours russia and the european union , have expressed concern at the crisis and urged both sides to refrain from any use of violence . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine crisis abates with plans for new elections in september ukraine 's sparring political parties agreed to a date for fresh parliamentary elections early sunday in a breakthrough hailed by both sides as an end to their feud , and the threat of military confrontation in kiev .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .

a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.05.2007 europe seeks to pressure china at eu-asia meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi european foreign ministers will confront china over kosovo , the darfur conflict and its tacit support for myanmar at a major eu-asia meeting which began in hamburg on monday , diplomats said . " ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .

despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems .

due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems . " there need to be control mechanisms in place , so that life-saving medication that has been sold cheaply in africa does not wind up being resold in europe at a much higher price , with only the profiteers benefiting , " said preissner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best actress jeon do-yeon instead best actor went to konstantin lavronenko , the lead of a bleak russian look at broken families , " the banishment " -lrb- the prize collected by the film 's director andrei zviaguintsev , right , on his behalf -rrb- , while south korea 's jeon do-yeon , playing a grief-struck woman wrestling with tragedy and faith in " secret sunshine " , picked up best actress .
" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .
michael moore 's new documentary " sicko " tackled the deficiencies of the us health system and " a mighty heart " starring angelina jolie as the widow of daniel pearl , remembered the wall street journal reporter decapitated by islamic extremists in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannes films come to poor parisian suburbs for the first time , the cannes festival ’ s top films won ’ t be screened exclusively in the beach town .

" we regret that it has been hard to reach agreement with the us administration , but now we are delighted that there is a wide-ranging public debate about the issue in america , " gabriel said on monday after holding talks with us house of representatives leader nancy pelosi in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi , right , and sigmar gabriel " i believe germany 's policy on climate change is the right one , " he said .
" we want to take concrete steps forward . "
the us democratic party leader , who is an outspoken critic of president george w. bush , was in berlin on the first stop of a european tour , accompanied by a delegation of high-ranking democratic and republican politicians .
" this trip for us began in greenland where we saw first-hand evidence that climate change is a reality , " pelosi said at a press conference .
" there is just no denying it . "
" i hope that we can all assume our responsibilities with great respect and that our administration will be open to listening to why it is important to go forward , perhaps in a different way than we have proceeded in the past , " she said .
global danger since democrats took over congress in january , both the house and senate have proposed to push the nation more aggressively to reduce carbon emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has so far refused to sign the kyoto agreement on greenhouse emissions leaked documents , however , have shown that washington is raising strong objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts for the june 6-8 summit of the leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
pelosi declined to say whether washington would sign up to the german proposal of limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" first we have to have a fundamental agreement as to what the challenges and possibilities are for reaching such a goal , " she said .
" the science is clear , the challenge is undeniable , we have to work together though to reach a solution . "
" all of us are committed to finding the best possible science and workable solutions to the challenges we face . "
german leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is ademant about fighting global warming pelosi said she would thank chancellor angela merkel for her " leadership " on the climate change issue when they meet on tuesday .
but in another sign of the obstacles facing germany , india , which has been invited to participate at heiligendamm , said monday it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions because stricter restrictions would slow its booming economy .
gabriel said developing nations like china and india could only be persuaded to commit to climate change restrictions if the most industrial nations such as germany and the united states led the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.05.2007 the battle between patents and patients to ease aids suffering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority who test hiv positive are african , and only 28 percent get treatment pharmaceuticals have an imperative beyond the profit motive , since they are in the business of saving lives .
despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .

" we regret that it has been hard to reach agreement with the us administration , but now we are delighted that there is a wide-ranging public debate about the issue in america , " gabriel said on monday after holding talks with us house of representatives leader nancy pelosi in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi , right , and sigmar gabriel " i believe germany 's policy on climate change is the right one , " he said .
" we want to take concrete steps forward . "
the us democratic party leader , who is an outspoken critic of president george w. bush , was in berlin on the first stop of a european tour , accompanied by a delegation of high-ranking democratic and republican politicians .
" this trip for us began in greenland where we saw first-hand evidence that climate change is a reality , " pelosi said at a press conference .
" there is just no denying it . "
" i hope that we can all assume our responsibilities with great respect and that our administration will be open to listening to why it is important to go forward , perhaps in a different way than we have proceeded in the past , " she said .

pelosi declined to say whether washington would sign up to the german proposal of limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" first we have to have a fundamental agreement as to what the challenges and possibilities are for reaching such a goal , " she said .
" the science is clear , the challenge is undeniable , we have to work together though to reach a solution . "
" all of us are committed to finding the best possible science and workable solutions to the challenges we face . "
german leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is ademant about fighting global warming pelosi said she would thank chancellor angela merkel for her " leadership " on the climate change issue when they meet on tuesday .
but in another sign of the obstacles facing germany , india , which has been invited to participate at heiligendamm , said monday it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions because stricter restrictions would slow its booming economy .
gabriel said developing nations like china and india could only be persuaded to commit to climate change restrictions if the most industrial nations such as germany and the united states led the way .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .
4 to july 22 . akp leading polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union observers are keeping a close eye on the turkish electoral process recent public opinion surveys show that after four and a half years in power , the akp is still turkey 's most popular party , leading its rivals in the badly fractured opposition by a wide margin . the akp has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to secularism and carried out reforms that stabilized the economy and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but its opponents say it still harbors islamist ambitions , pointing at akp opposition to a headscarf ban in universities and public offices , its encouragement of religious schools and a failed attempt to restrict alcohol sales . sezer 's seven-year term expired on may 16 and he is currently serving as acting head of state . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy tackles turkey question during diplomatic tour on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .
4 to july 22 . akp leading polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union observers are keeping a close eye on the turkish electoral process recent public opinion surveys show that after four and a half years in power , the akp is still turkey 's most popular party , leading its rivals in the badly fractured opposition by a wide margin . the akp has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to secularism and carried out reforms that stabilized the economy and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but its opponents say it still harbors islamist ambitions , pointing at akp opposition to a headscarf ban in universities and public offices , its encouragement of religious schools and a failed attempt to restrict alcohol sales . sezer 's seven-year term expired on may 16 and he is currently serving as acting head of state . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy tackles turkey question during diplomatic tour on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "

western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .

according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .

merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .

the debate over changes to the constitution was able to continue after a short break . the governing islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which twice failed to get its presidential candidate elected in parliament this month in the face of strong secularist opposition , is pushing for changes to be made to the presidential election process . the staunchly secular sezer , who has often clashed with the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , sent the bill back to parliament friday , saying the amendments were adopted hastily and without sufficient debate . there was " no justifiable and acceptable reason or necessity " to introduce a two-round popular presidential vote , said sezer , a former head of the constitutional court . akp promises to resubmit changes bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators took to the streets to protest again over the weekend sezer said the bill would lead to " a deviation from the parliamentary system " and " create far-reaching , irreparable problems . " but defying the president , the akp responded by saying it would push the bill through parliament for a second time - and without changes .
under turkish law , constitutional amendments are voted in two readings , at least 48 hours apart .
the second round of voting was expected on thursday . the bill also calls for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term and sets general elections every four years instead of every five years . should the amendments pass through parliament a second time , sezer will not be able to veto them again , though he can submit them to a public referendum . secularists remain alarmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , right , was erdogan 's choice for president the akp says the amendments are the solution to a political crisis sparked by the recent presidential election in which the sole candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , was forced to withdraw . the opposition boycotted the presidential vote twice , denying the house the quorum required to make the ballot valid .
gul was virtually certain to be elected in the later stages of the election in the akp-dominated parliament . the prospect of the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , electing one of its own to the presidency alarmed secularists , who accuse the government of seeking to increase the role of islam in politics and public life . the turmoil , exacerbated by a stiff warning from the military that it stands ready to defend the secular order , forced erdogan to bring legislative elections forward from nov .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best actress jeon do-yeon instead best actor went to konstantin lavronenko , the lead of a bleak russian look at broken families , " the banishment " -lrb- the prize collected by the film 's director andrei zviaguintsev , right , on his behalf -rrb- , while south korea 's jeon do-yeon , playing a grief-struck woman wrestling with tragedy and faith in " secret sunshine " , picked up best actress .
" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .
michael moore 's new documentary " sicko " tackled the deficiencies of the us health system and " a mighty heart " starring angelina jolie as the widow of daniel pearl , remembered the wall street journal reporter decapitated by islamic extremists in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannes films come to poor parisian suburbs for the first time , the cannes festival ’ s top films won ’ t be screened exclusively in the beach town .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .

the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .

according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .

merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .

" 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " won the palme d 'or at the star-studded 60th edition of the world 's premiere filmfest , beating out previous palme winners , the coen brothers , gus van sant , quentin tarantino and serbian director emir kusturica .
" this is the ultimate recognition that you are really a filmmaker , " cristian mungiu , 39 , told reporters after a glittering awards ceremony where he accepted the golden trophy from veteran hollywood actress jane fonda .
his small-budget film , his second feature , evokes big themes of personal freedom and alienation in a wrenching story about a girl 's back-alley abortion in communist-era romania .
it was an early favourite at the 12-day festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who chose the 22 films in competition , said the jury favoured the cutting edge of contemporary filmmaking .
" the winners reflect our intention when selecting the films to look to the future , " he told reporters .
" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this .

third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .

akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven .

" by rewarding romania , mexico and south korea , the jury highlighted three of the most stimulating countries in international cinema in recent years . "
the runner-up grand prix trophy went to " the mourning forest , " a slow-moving spiritual tale of two grief-stricken people by japanese director naomi kawase .
kawase , who won the camera d 'or at cannes for best first film 10 years ago , fought back tears as she clutched the prize .
" in life there are many difficulties , many things that make you suffer and hesitate along the way , " she said .
" at such moments , one finds strength not in money , cars or clothing but in something intangible . "
her picture beat fare from top directors including joel and ethan coen , with an existential cowboy film called " no country for old men , " van sant , who returned to teenage blues in " paranoid park , " tarantino , with an ode to trashy drive-in movies in " death proof , " and kusturica 's balkan romp " promise me this . "
third placed jury prize was shared by " persepolis , " french-iranian debut director marjane satrapi 's autobiographical animation on life under the ayatollahs which has angered tehran , and " silent light , " a mexican movie about love , death and faith , by carlos reygadas .
julian schnabel , the accomplished us painter and sculptor , picked up best director for " the diving bell and the butterfly , " about a french magazine editor who managed to write a book after suffering a debilitating stroke .
" in my wildest dreams i would never believe i was here because basically i 'm just a movie fan - i never thought i was going to be a movie director , " he said .
akin wins prize for best script bildunterschrift : director fatih akin holds his jury prize for the best script at cannes german-turkish director fatih akin 's " the edge of heaven " scooped the prize for best script .
picking up the prize , the 33-year-old film-maker said he was addressing a message to turkey - " we must remain united or we will fall . "
he spoke after turkey 's mass pro-secular demonstrations against the islamist-rooted government which have triggered political turmoil .
his film scooped a first cinematic honour on saturday , when the ecumenical jury award handed its small but prestigious cannes prize to his movie for its power in bringing home a tragedy about two families bridging the east-west divide .
hanna schygulla , perhaps best known as the muse to legendary german director rainer fassbinder , heads a remarkable cast of germans and turks .
it is akin 's second film in a trilogy that began with " head on , " the international art-house hit that brought him his first major success .
the movie confronts death in a convincing tale of loss and forgiveness that moved many to tears at its premiere .
big hollywood names miss out in acting awards for the acting prizes , the jury also skipped stars such as javier bardem in " no country for old men , " jude law in hong kong director wong kar-wai 's romance " my blueberry nights , " jake gyllenhaal and robert downey jr in serial killer flick " zodiac " and schygulla in akin 's " the edge of heaven . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best actress jeon do-yeon instead best actor went to konstantin lavronenko , the lead of a bleak russian look at broken families , " the banishment " -lrb- the prize collected by the film 's director andrei zviaguintsev , right , on his behalf -rrb- , while south korea 's jeon do-yeon , playing a grief-struck woman wrestling with tragedy and faith in " secret sunshine " , picked up best actress .
" there are many fabulous actresses here at the festival and i would like to represent them all here tonight .
it is a great honour for me to have this prize , " said 34-year-old jeon .
a special prize for the filmfest 's 60th went to van sant , who won the palme four years ago for " elephant . "
the cannes jury this year was headed by british director stephen frears -lrb- " the queen " -rrb- , and included actresses maggie cheung of hong kong , toni colette of australia , and turkey 's nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk .
they - and many of the 15,000 festival-goers - sat through a program dominated by dark themes .
outside of the competition , politics came to cannes .
michael moore 's new documentary " sicko " tackled the deficiencies of the us health system and " a mighty heart " starring angelina jolie as the widow of daniel pearl , remembered the wall street journal reporter decapitated by islamic extremists in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannes films come to poor parisian suburbs for the first time , the cannes festival ’ s top films won ’ t be screened exclusively in the beach town .

but some fear even these steps wo n't heal the ex-soviet republic . the two rivals in the power struggle , president viktor yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych , agreed on sunday to hold elections on september 30 but their deal hinges on parliamentary votes on tuesday and wednesday .
once the votes are passed , yushchenko is to formally set the election date .
" agreement on the date is only the beginning of the end of the crisis and the vote in parliament will be its final point , " vadim karasyov , head of the institute for global strategies in kiev , told reporters .
an earlier agreement to resolve the crisis fell through last month .
the votes include parliamentary approval of financing for the elections and changes in the make-up of the central elections commission to allow greater representation for members of yanukovych 's ruling regions party .
under the deal hammered out between the president and the prime minister , parliament is also due to approve a series of bills easing ukraine 's bid to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sharp differences may hinder elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktors are still poles apart on many issues political analyst kost bondarenko said he did not expect the parliamentary to pass off smoothly as there are sharp differences between yushchenko supporters and yanukovych loyalists in the legislature .
yushchenko has set wto membership as a key goal for ukraine but has faced opposition among yanukovych allies in parliament on measures aimed at liberalising the economy .
despite the show of unity by yushchenko and yanukovych on sunday - the two even attended the ukrainian cup final together later in the day - tensions were barely below the surface .
" if the opposition fulfils all the conditions to allow the president to sign the order , then there will be early elections and as lawful citizens we will take part in them , " yanukovych said in lukewarm comments about the deal .
his regions party took the lion 's share of the vote in parliamentary elections last year and is expected to do well again in any upcoming elections .
president seen as a failure by many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko has failed on his promises , some say in the eyes of many ukrainians , pro-western yushchenko has failed to live up to his promises of a bright economic future and international integration made during the orange revolution in 2004 .
a poll by the sofia research centre earlier this month gave the regions party 41 percent of voting intentions .
another poll by the international sociology institute in kiev gave it 35.5 percent .
yushchenko 's our ukraine party scored just 15.9 percent and 12.9 percent .
but , despite yanukovych 's power , his coalition with the socialist and communist parties is fragile and faces a challenge from yushchenko ally yulia tymoshenko , whose party is expected to come second .
in the orange revolution , mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency and tymoshenko to the prime minister 's post , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to his moscow-backed rival yanukovych .
dissoultion of parliament led to troop build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed at the weekend the latest political crisis between yushchenko and yanukovych began on april 2 , when the prime minister defied orders from the president to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
as the power struggle escalated , thousands of protestors held rival rallies in the capital kiev and , last week , yushchenko and yanukovych ratcheted up the tension still further by sparring for control of security forces .
international powers , including ukraine 's giant neighbours russia and the european union , have expressed concern at the crisis and urged both sides to refrain from any use of violence . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine crisis abates with plans for new elections in september ukraine 's sparring political parties agreed to a date for fresh parliamentary elections early sunday in a breakthrough hailed by both sides as an end to their feud , and the threat of military confrontation in kiev .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.05.2007 the battle between patents and patients to ease aids suffering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority who test hiv positive are african , and only 28 percent get treatment pharmaceuticals have an imperative beyond the profit motive , since they are in the business of saving lives .
despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high . how much should multi-national drug companies charge for life-saving medicine in the world 's poorest countries ? it is clear that pharmaceutical companies are not in the charity business .
they need to recoup the billions invested in breakthrough drugs , and do this by acquiring a patent that protects their proprietary know-how for years , even decades .
the patent allows them to reap the benefits of a virtual monopoly for an essential drug , and legally prevents cheap copycat versions from flooding the market and drastically bringing down prices . yet on the other hand , can we let millions in africa and elsewhere suffer and die , when the medicine that could save them is available , but costs too much because of such patent protection ? big pharma vs. desperate need for hiv drugs it 's a debate that has been heating up in the run up to the g8 summit where the interests of multinational pharmaceuticals are pitted against the desperate health needs of a poverty stricken continent . africa will once again top the agenda on june 6-8 at the baltic seaside resort of heiligendamm , where leaders of the world 's richest industrial nations , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , are expected to renew their pledges to increase aid to the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-8 nations renew their pledges to africa the biggest scourge in sub-saharan africa is aids .
even though a cure for the disease is a long way off , a new generation of antiretroviral drugs has made living with hiv at least manageable in the west .
but these treatments are far less available where they are needed most . the vast majority of the 40 million worldwide who test hiv positive , live in sub-saharan africa .
due to the time delay in the onset of aids , an estimated 7 million currently require therapy , but only 28 percent are getting any treatment at all , meaning a premature death sentence for the rest , including millions of babies who are born with the virus , transmitted by their mothers . producing generic drugs more cheaply and legally since the aids virus keeps mutating and more resistant strains keep cropping up , what is at issue is access to " second line " antiretroviral therapy , which costs at least ten times as much as the older drugs . " after five years of treatment , some 20 percent of our patients need to switch to second line drugs , so we are seeing a doubling of drug costs in the next two years if prices remain at the current level , " dr. tido von schön-angerer , a german paediatrician who heads the campaign for access to essential medicines at doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , told dw-world.de. and in spite of deep discounts , those price levels are still way too high for the developing world , so von schön-angerer has strongly backed thailand 's decision earlier this month to defy patents through a legal mechanism called compulsory licencing that was established by the world trade organization in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the biggest supplier of generic hiv drugs the wto ruling allows governments to circumvent international patent laws to ensure the public health of its citizens .
that means either producing their own cheaper generic versions or importing them from india , which has been the biggest supplier of hiv drugs . diseases of poverty not profitable until a month ago , the sticker price for kaletra , the patented antiretroviral drug produced by us based abbott laboratories was $ 2,200 -lrb- 1,635 euros -rrb- per patient for a year 's supply in developing countries defined as " middle tier , " such as thailand .
abbott has since lowered its price to $ 1,000 . in comparison kaletra costs $ 7,000 in the united states and $ 500 for the least developed nations in africa , with the huge profit margins from the rich industrial nations cross-subsidizing the poorest countries . " we believe in differential pricing , " said abbott spokesman dirk van eeden .
" our approach is to charge the lowest possible price where the need is greatest in the least developed countries .
we are making no profit whatsoever in africa . " eeden also pointed out that the lowest generic price at $ 695 for the same drug is even higher than the original kaletra brand . " generics have not matched kaletra 's prices in africa , " countered dr. von schön-angerer .
" at least not yet , but once we see much greater generic competition , abbott 's prices will be undercut even further . " logistic problems and lack of healthcare workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand leads the fight against patent monopolies although tremendous public pressure has led to lower prices for life-saving drugs , africa 's vulnerability to aids can not be explained away by the lack of access to affordable medicine alone , according to markus preissner , head of the research division for pharmaceutical distribution at the university of cologne . " even if governments in africa could guarantee fully stocked pharmacies at rock bottom prices , there is still the problem of whether essential medicines and vaccines wind up with the end users — the patients who need them , " he said . the logistics of delivering supplies to patients in remote areas , the overwhelming lack of doctors and health workers to administer the medicines , and even the huge price differential between the same pill sold in africa and europe are massive problems . " there need to be control mechanisms in place , so that life-saving medication that has been sold cheaply in africa does not wind up being resold in europe at a much higher price , with only the profiteers benefiting , " said preissner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe .

d 'hont 's startling admissions in his recently-published book have led to a string of confessions from senior figures in the sport which have tarnished cycling 's image .
and ullrich , 33 , who won the 1997 tour de france , remains silent despite being suspected of using epo since he was implicated in the spanish doping investigation ' operation puerto ' which first engulfed the sport in may 2006 .
" it would be good for jan if he also made a clean sweep of the truth .

" ministers and eu officials will raise the issue of darfur directly with the chinese delegation , " a german source told afp at the eighth eu-asia meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- of foreign ministers .
the meeting is also expected to see myanmar face pressure over its decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy campaigner aung san suu kyi and more calls for china to condemn the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly critical of myanmar 's decision to extend house arrest for aung san suu kyi observers say that economic and diplomatic support from china and russia is allowing myanmar 's military rulers to rebuff international calls to release aung san suu kyi , despite strong pressure from the west .
japanese foreign minister taro aso raised the issue with his myanmar counterpart nyan win ahead of the asem meeting , aso 's spokesman told reporters .
he quoted win as saying extending the detention of the nobel peace laureate who has spent most of the past 17 years in house arrest , had been " a difficult decision . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has opposed kosovo 's secession from serbia eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that he had raised the fraught issue of kosovo 's future status in bilateral talks with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi on monday .
western powers introduced a resolution in the un security council earlier this month backing a un plan calling for the serbian province 's " internationally supervised independence . "
but as with darfur , china has taken a different position within the council and is opposing efforts to impose independence in the face of serbian resistance .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who has made darfur a priority since taking up his post earlier this month , is expected to lead efforts to bring china to heel over its backing for the sudanese government .
he was set to meet with yang and propose including china in a new contact group of nations on darfur .
close ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has called darfur one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises today china 's close ties with sudan - it sells arms to the african state and buys more than half its oil output - has bedeviled us-led attempts on the security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to let un troops into darfur .
according to un figures , fighting in the western sudanese region has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2003 when an ethnic minority rebellion met with a scorched earth response from the government and allied arab militias .
german chancellor angela merkel has put darfur on the agenda for the g8 summit next week , while french president nicolas sarkozy has warned that neither this issue nor the iranian and north korean nuclear crises can be resolved " without strong and positive chinese involvement . "
china has been blocking us-led attempts at the un security council to use sanctions to force sudan to allow un troops into the region to stem the bloodshed .
on friday , the council endorsed plans for a hybrid un-african union force but its deployment remains subject to the approval of khartoum .
climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty the asem meeting is due to focus strongly on climate change , which merkel has put high on the agenda for the group of eight summit .
she is hosting the event in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
merkel hoped to tie china and india into a new accord on fighting greenhouse gas emissions once the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 , but yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to restrictions in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
the asem meeting began against a backdrop of protest on monday as thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators gearing up for the g8 summit took to the streets of this german port city .

they hope it will lead to a single blood test which would reveal a woman 's risk of getting the disease .
researchers say the new technique speeds up gene identification and could mean finding all the genes associated with breast cancer .
cancer research uk described the development as " hugely significant " .
new discoveries scientists found two genes responsible for breast cancer two years ago .
but now new research led by cancer research uk 's cambridge research institute , published in the nature journal , has found five more .
it used to take decades to go through a patient 's dna and find faulty genes , but the newly-developed technique now makes the process much faster . "
now we know these search methods are effective , we think that many more breast cancer genes can be found " professor douglas easton cancer research uk it compares significant parts of the patient 's dna with a healthy volunteer 's and the differences are judged most likely to be the genes responsible for the disease .
this computer-based process can be completed in just a few hours and scientists believe that , within a few months , researchers could find all the genes involved in the development of breast cancer .
to find the four new genes , they sifted through the dna of nearly 50,000 women , half of them breast cancer patients and half healthy .
inherited cases professor douglas easton , director of cancer research uk 's genetic epidemiology unit in cambridge , said : " now we know these search methods are effective , we think that many more breast cancer genes can be found .
" these methods are already being applied by cancer research uk to find genes for a whole range of other cancers , including prostate , bowel and lung cancer . "
he told bbc five live that if more genes were identified it may help prevent the disease because people who were at " particularly high risk of the disease " could be identified . "
it 's likely many more cancer predisposing genes will be identified using similar approaches in the next few months " leading cancer specialist professor karol sikora overall , inherited cases make up between 5 and 10 % of all breast cancer cases in the uk which total 44,000 a year .
" lifestyle factors " such as smoking and environmental factors are believed to account for the rest .
currently , doctors only test for four genes , brca1 , brca2 , tp53 and pten , as these are associated with high risks of developing cancer .
but they believe there are hundreds more breast cancer genes to be found .
search continues leading cancer specialist professor karol sikora said : " it 's likely many more cancer predisposing genes will be identified using similar approaches in the next few months .
" by risk banding women we will be able to target screening programmes far more effectively as well as developing tailored prevention strategies just for those most likely to get cancer .
" i suspect that in the next three years it will be possible to separate a group of women into those that have a very high chance of getting breast cancer , those that have a very low chance and those that are in the middle . "
lead author professor bruce ponder , director of cancer research uk 's cambridge research institute at the university of cambridge , said researchers did not yet know how these genes interacted with each other .
he added : " we 'll continue to search for more genes , but we 'll also focus on unravelling this information so that we 're ready to offer advice to women who may carry one or more of these faulty genes in the future . "

butterfly conservation scotland is leading a survey of the orange tip .
new sightings of it have come in from dingwall , iona and mull so far .
the group hopes to improve records of the species , but also gauge the impact warmer weather is having on it .
meanwhile , there are concerns that unseasonable conditions may harm a rare moth called the dark bordered beauty .
its eggs hatch to coincide with new leaves on aspen trees .
tiny caterpillars tom prescott , highlands and islands project officer , said there were worries that the hatching and availability of the species ' food plant were " out of sync " because of global warming .
because the dark bordered beauty 's caterpillars are so tiny , he said it would not be until the moths were on the wing in june that it would be possible to assess its populations in scotland .
reports of orange tips are being sent to the conservation group 's headquarters in stirling .
mr prescott said new sightings in dingwall , ross-shire , and the islands of iona and mull were due to a lack of previous recording work , or the species benefiting from warmer weather .
observations can be sent in writing to : butterfly conservation scotland , balallan house , 24 allan park , stirling , fk8 2qg .

the abundance of these groups can not be solely explained by the pun potential of the name .
but a selected roll-call certainly makes entertaining reading : the police squad , the police state , the police academy , the counterfeit police , stung .
appropriately for a group who were once among the biggest on the planet , the police tribute acts are patrolling stages around the world .
as well as numerous uk and us groups , acts have sprung up in argentina , germany , the netherlands , italy , spain and ireland .
but with the original trio back on the road - albeit not driving themselves in a rented van as they famously did in the us in the 1970s - who will want to see impersonators of the police ?
the answer seems to be more people than ever .
vote are you looking forward to the police 's world tour ?
yes - every little thing they do is magic no - de do do do n't care results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion england-based band the secret police are one of the foremost tribute acts , having played all over europe , in the middle east , and to audiences of up to 12,000 in their 11 years together .
drummer cameron findlay says that a video of his band performing the police 's first major hit , roxanne , attracts about 150 hits a day on the clip-sharing website youtube .
on the day sting , andy summers and stewart copeland shared a stage to perform the same song at this year 's grammy awards , there were some 8,500 viewings of the video .
" with the recent news , the enquiries and our profile have gone through the roof , " says findlay .
the secret police are playing several festivals this summer and are set to feature in a canadian television documentary about tribute bands .
the film will also feature los angeles-based the police experience , who call themselves the " official police tribute band " .
in their previous incarnation , fallout , they performed at the 2003 birthday party of stewart copeland , and they are managed by copeland 's brother miles .
on the police experience website , stewart copeland is quoted as saying they recreate " every nuance , all the drum parts , and the singer has sting down to a tee " . "
we can stop dying our hair now , because they are all grey " cameron findlay the secret police " we have the blessing of the original band in a sense , " says singer david rasner .
" these guys are not going to play every nook and cranny of the world - they are doing a limited run and they are playing gigantic places .
" basically it 's going to be nothing but good for us - the buzz and the excitement is going to mean more work . "
' high-energy ' rasner also suggests his own band 's shows may be closer to the police in their heyday than sting and co will deliver on their tour .
it launches in vancouver , canada , on monday .
" we are kind of doing the police as you remember them , " says 40-year-old rasner .
" we were really maniacal about doing it as they did it live .
we wanted to reproduce their shows . "
he goes on : " some of that 's going to remain , but they are not going to have the same kind of energy and be jumping around everywhere . "
findlay welcomes the image of a more " senior " police replacing the one that has remained in fans ' minds since the band separated in the early eighties .
" we can stop dying our hair now , because they are all grey , which is what we are hiding under various bottles of peroxide , " he says .
" we might just go grey now gracefully - the police have led the way for it . "
but findlay is hopeful that something more may come out of the reunion - new songs .
" we have probably played roxanne more times than they have , " he says .
" it would be nice if we could have some new material , please . "
but he admits the band have already provided them with an abundance of material .
" there are some tribute bands that really struggle to put an hour and a bit of back-to-back hits together - we have never had that problem thanks to the great songs that they wrote . "
bert boven , who fronts the dutch tribute act synchronicity , says it is the longer shows that identify the police 's hardcore fans .
" another hour , then you can see who the real fans are - they sing along with the unknown songs , " says the 36-year-old .
" i always look for them after the gig - i like to know their opinion about us .
" they always react enthusiastically . "
all the tribute bands plan to see the police during their tour .
" the police 's music will never die , " insists boven .
" in another 30 years there will still be songs played on the radio by them . "

drummer cameron findlay says that a video of his band performing the police 's first major hit , roxanne , attracts about 150 hits a day on the clip-sharing website youtube .
on the day sting , andy summers and stewart copeland shared a stage to perform the same song at this year 's grammy awards , there were some 8,500 viewings of the video .

the film will also feature los angeles-based the police experience , who call themselves the " official police tribute band " .
in their previous incarnation , fallout , they performed at the 2003 birthday party of stewart copeland , and they are managed by copeland 's brother miles .

we can stop dying our hair now , because they are all grey cameron findlay the secret police " we have the blessing of the original band in a sense , " says singer david rasner .
" these guys are not going to play every nook and cranny of the world - they are doing a limited run and they are playing gigantic places .
" basically it 's going to be nothing but good for us - the buzz and the excitement is going to mean more work . "
' high-energy ' rasner also suggests his own band 's shows may be closer to the police in their heyday than sting and co will deliver on their tour .
it launches in vancouver , canada , on monday .
" we are kind of doing the police as you remember them , " says 40-year-old rasner .
" we were really maniacal about doing it as they did it live .
we wanted to reproduce their shows . "
the police have sold more than 50 million albums worldwide he goes on : " some of that 's going to remain , but they are not going to have the same kind of energy and be jumping around everywhere . "
findlay welcomes the image of a more " senior " police replacing the one that has remained in fans ' minds since the band separated in the early eighties .
" we can stop dying our hair now , because they are all grey , which is what we are hiding under various bottles of peroxide , " he says .
" we might just go grey now gracefully - the police have led the way for it . "
but findlay is hopeful that something more may come out of the reunion - new songs .
" we have probably played roxanne more times than they have , " he says .
" it would be nice if we could have some new material , please . "
synchronicity are not look-alikes but sound like the police , says boven but he admits the band have already provided them with an abundance of material .
" there are some tribute bands that really struggle to put an hour and a bit of back-to-back hits together - we have never had that problem thanks to the great songs that they wrote . "
bert boven , who fronts the dutch tribute act synchronicity , says it is the longer shows that identify the police 's hardcore fans .
" another hour , then you can see who the real fans are - they sing along with the unknown songs , " says the 36-year-old .
" i always look for them after the gig - i like to know their opinion about us .
" they always react enthusiastically . "
all the tribute bands plan to see the police during their tour .
" the police 's music will never die , " insists boven .
" in another 30 years there will still be songs played on the radio by them . "

it has the tents , rain clouds and bizarre fashions you would expect at the annual glastonbury festival .
however , it 's not the red hot chili peppers who are playing - it 's the dead hot chili peppers .
rather than oasis , it 's oasish .
thousands are camping out in the rain to see copies of their favourite bands in a field near loughborough .
it 's the low-cost , easy-access alternative to glastonbury , and what it lacks in genuine stars , it makes up for in hits , with bands playing all the classics .
it 's just a taste of what is now available throughout britain .
patrick haveron , of psycho management , represents 237 tribute bands and is creating more .
he 's in the midst of setting up a razorlike and has spotted a new gap in the market - the spice girls .
in 2000 he used to have 12 such tribute bands on his books .
they faded out , but he feels the time is right for a revival .
" we now have four take that tributes and they are all selling out .
i do n't understand why four blokes singing to a backing track is so popular , but it is , " explains mr haveron .
strong competition meanwhile back at the festival , pink fraud are setting up .
some bands may treat it all as a bit of a giggle , but not this one .
they even have some of pink floyd 's original gear and their guitarist proudly displays one of david gilmour 's own plectrums .
what began as a shared passion for pink floyd 's ' 70s albums has turned into an elaborate attempt to recreate the look , sound and feel of being at a floyd gig in 1975 .
pink floyd might never be able to recapture that moment , but pink fraud reimagined the entire theatrical experience .
if you squinted , the wigs , flares and backdrops could just about convince you that you had stepped back in time .
but it is a competitive market .
they claim there are currently 37 pink floyd tribute acts in britain , with more appearing all the time .
of course , the ups and downs of the tribute world reflects wider musical trends .
the lead singer of oasish is also in the stereotonics , but he no longer plays in a police tribute band .
he much prefers being liam gallagher to being andy summers .
however , with the police set to go back on the road , there 's scope for a new batch of stings .
the problem , according to mr haveron , is that it 's hard to find a good sting .
more difficult still is a convincing freddie mercury - but he 's never had too much trouble with a fake gary barlow .
tribute bands began in australia as a solution to the problem of bands not touring in the antipodes .
in britain , it is largely a small-town phenomenon .
the gradual erosion of the musical generation gap has opened up music to britain 's teenagers that they never had a chance of seeing performed live .
kurt cobain died in 1994 , so burt cocaine in teen spirit has spent 12 years giving people an eerily accurate recreation of seeing nirvana at their height .
jonny rotter can swear and snarl as if the golden jubilee was still taking place , though two years ago he had n't even heard of john lydon , lead singer of the sex pistols .
it was only when he saw the former punk on i 'm a celebrity ...
get me out of here that he picked up a cd and his life was changed .
passion for music this is the answer to overpriced stadium gigs , and while it might attract some sneers , it reflects a demand for something the mainstream music industry has n't been providing .
several tribute bands can now fill london 's royal albert hall , and pink fraud will themselves be playing at this year 's glastonbury .
indeed , the whole event feels very " punk " in the sense that this is homegrown , do-it-yourself music , far beyond the corporate music industry .
they might not write their own songs , but the bands are passionate about the music and do n't -lrb- for the most part -rrb- take themselves too seriously .
self-indulgent rock pomposity is pointless because if you do n't give the fans what they want then there is always another version of the band in the wings .
it is a sort of free-market folk culture , where people have taken control of the music and made it their own .
amongst fans there was a keen sense of getting one over on bands who rarely play venues they can reach or afford .
some felt the tribute bands were often better than the real thing .
the antarctic monkeys , the tribute version of the arctic monkeys , were highly praised by several other bands backstage .
but there was a word of warning from mr haveron .
" if you want to play on a big stage with an adoring crowd , then this is the way forward , " he said .
" unfortunately when you take the wig off and step off stage people do n't know who you are , and it is a bit disappointing . "

welcome to glastonbudget .

it 's the low-cost , easy-access alternative to glastonbury , and what it lacks in genuine stars , it makes up for in hits , with bands playing all the classics .

he 's in the midst of setting up a razorlike and has spotted a new gap in the market - the spice girls .
in 2000 he used to have 12 such tribute bands on his books .
they faded out , but he feels the time is right for a revival .
" we now have four take that tributes and they are all selling out .
i do n't understand why four blokes singing to a backing track is so popular , but it is , " explains mr haveron .
strong competition meanwhile back at the festival , pink fraud are setting up .

members of the right-wing swiss people 's party , currently the largest party in the swiss parliament , have launched a campaign to have the building of minarets banned .
they claim the minaret is not necessary for worship , but is rather a symbol of islamic law , and as such incompatible with switzerland 's legal system .
signatures are now being collected to force a nationwide referendum on the issue which , under switzerland 's system of direct democracy , would be binding .
the move has shocked switzerland 's 350,000 muslims , many of whom have been campaigning for decades for more recognition for their faith .
in theory switzerland is a secular state , whose constitution guarantees freedom of religious expression to all .
in practice however mosques in switzerland tend to be confined to disused warehouses and factories .
across the country , there are only two small minarets , one in zurich and one in geneva , neither of which are permitted to make the call to prayer .
in switzerland 's capital berne , the largest mosque is in a former underground car park .
plans rejected in the small town of langenthal , just outside berne , plans to build a very modest minaret have been put on ice following thousands of objections .
many swiss think minarets have no place on their urban skylines langenthal 's mosque is housed in a former paint factory on the outskirts of town .
mutalip karaademi , an ethnic albanian who has lived in switzerland for 26 years , was at first pleased when his proposal for a 5m-high -lrb- 16.5ft -rrb- minaret was approved by the local authority .
but following a vociferous campaign against the plans , including a petition with thousands of signatures , the cantonal government in berne delayed the project indefinitely .
" we are very disappointed , " said mr karaademi .
" we just wanted to do our mosque up a bit , with this small minaret and a tea room .
we actually thought it might promote dialogue . "
mr karaademi is also bitter at what he sees as unfair discrimination against his faith .
" i even gave them a written undertaking that we would never make the call to prayer , " he said .
" they seem to think we are all criminals or terrorists - that 's like saying all italians are in the mafia . "
islamic law but supporters of a ban on minarets say they have no intention of preventing anyone from practising their faith .
" we do n't have anything against muslims , " said oskar freysinger , member of parliament for the swiss people 's party .
" but we do n't want minarets .
the minaret is a symbol of a political and aggressive islam , it 's a symbol of islamic law .
the minute you have minarets in europe it means islam will have taken over . "
mr freysinger 's words may sound extreme , even paranoid , but this is a general election year in switzerland , and the campaign against minarets is playing well with voters .
a recent opinion poll for one swiss newspaper found that 43 % of those surveyed were in favour of a ban on minarets .
" we have our civil laws here , " insisted mr freysinger .
" banning minarets would send a clear signal that our european laws , our swiss laws , have to be accepted .
and if you want to live here , you must accept them .
if you do n't , then go back . "
growing resentment it 's a harsh message for swiss muslims , many of whom were born in switzerland .
there are fears that the campaign against minarets will provoke growing resentment against swiss society .
" i think swiss muslims will be angry and bitter over this , " said reinhard schulze , professor of islamic studies at berne university .
" and we know that anger and bitterness among a community can lead to radicalisation , even to militancy . "
the swiss government is extremely nervous about the prospect of militancy among swiss muslims ; three cabinet ministers have already spoken out against the campaign to ban minarets .
there is also a growing fear that the debate will damage switzerland 's traditionally good relations with the arab world .
but the swiss people 's party is powerful .
if the minaret campaign is , as some suspect , a vote-grabbing ploy ahead of october 's general election , then it is a successful one ; the party is riding high in the opinion polls .
a constitutional amendment forbidding minarets will have to be approved in a nationwide referendum .
in the meantime , no minarets are being built anywhere in switzerland ; the controversy has created a situation in which no local planning officer wants to be the first to approve one .
in that respect , the people 's party may have got what it secretly wanted all along , an unofficial ban on minarets .
so for now , switzerland 's muslims will continue to pray in abandoned buildings , many with the growing feeling that they are tolerated only as long as they remain invisible .

mutalip karaademi , an ethnic albanian who has lived in switzerland for 26 years , was at first pleased when his proposal for a 5m-high -lrb- 16.5ft -rrb- minaret was approved by the local authority .
but following a vociferous campaign against the plans , including a petition with thousands of signatures , the cantonal government in berne delayed the project indefinitely .
" we are very disappointed , " said mr karaademi .
" we just wanted to do our mosque up a bit , with this small minaret and a tea room .
we actually thought it might promote dialogue . "
mr karaademi is also bitter at what he sees as unfair discrimination against his faith .
" i even gave them a written undertaking that we would never make the call to prayer , " he said .
" they seem to think we are all criminals or terrorists - that 's like saying all italians are in the mafia . "
islamic law but supporters of a ban on minarets say they have no intention of preventing anyone from practising their faith .
" we do n't have anything against muslims , " said oskar freysinger , member of parliament for the swiss people 's party .
" but we do n't want minarets .
the minaret is a symbol of a political and aggressive islam , it 's a symbol of islamic law .
the minute you have minarets in europe it means islam will have taken over . "
mr freysinger 's words may sound extreme , even paranoid , but this is a general election year in switzerland , and the campaign against minarets is playing well with voters .
a recent opinion poll for one swiss newspaper found that 43 % of those surveyed were in favour of a ban on minarets .
" we have our civil laws here , " insisted mr freysinger .
" banning minarets would send a clear signal that our european laws , our swiss laws , have to be accepted .
and if you want to live here , you must accept them .
if you do n't , then go back . "
growing resentment it 's a harsh message for swiss muslims , many of whom were born in switzerland .
there are fears that the campaign against minarets will provoke growing resentment against swiss society .
" i think swiss muslims will be angry and bitter over this , " said reinhard schulze , professor of islamic studies at berne university .
" and we know that anger and bitterness among a community can lead to radicalisation , even to militancy . "
the swiss government is extremely nervous about the prospect of militancy among swiss muslims ; three cabinet ministers have already spoken out against the campaign to ban minarets .
there is also a growing fear that the debate will damage switzerland 's traditionally good relations with the arab world .
but the swiss people 's party is powerful .
if the minaret campaign is , as some suspect , a vote-grabbing ploy ahead of october 's general election , then it is a successful one ; the party is riding high in the opinion polls .
a constitutional amendment forbidding minarets will have to be approved in a nationwide referendum .
in the meantime , no minarets are being built anywhere in switzerland ; the controversy has created a situation in which no local planning officer wants to be the first to approve one .
in that respect , the people 's party may have got what it secretly wanted all along , an unofficial ban on minarets .
so for now , switzerland 's muslims will continue to pray in abandoned buildings , many with the growing feeling that they are tolerated only as long as they remain invisible .

members of the right-wing swiss people 's party , currently the largest party in the swiss parliament , have launched a campaign to have the building of minarets banned .
they claim the minaret is not necessary for worship , but is rather a symbol of islamic law , and as such incompatible with switzerland 's legal system .
signatures are now being collected to force a nationwide referendum on the issue which , under switzerland 's system of direct democracy , would be binding .
the move has shocked switzerland 's 350,000 muslims , many of whom have been campaigning for decades for more recognition for their faith .
in theory switzerland is a secular state , whose constitution guarantees freedom of religious expression to all .
in practice however mosques in switzerland tend to be confined to disused warehouses and factories .
across the country , there are only two small minarets , one in zurich and one in geneva , neither of which are permitted to make the call to prayer .

the move has shocked switzerland 's 350,000 muslims , many of whom have been campaigning for decades for more recognition for their faith .
in theory switzerland is a secular state , whose constitution guarantees freedom of religious expression to all .
in practice however mosques in switzerland tend to be confined to disused warehouses and factories .
across the country , there are only two small minarets , one in zurich and one in geneva , neither of which are permitted to make the call to prayer .
in switzerland 's capital berne , the largest mosque is in a former underground car park .
plans rejected in the small town of langenthal , just outside berne , plans to build a very modest minaret have been put on ice following thousands of objections .
langenthal 's mosque is housed in a former paint factory on the outskirts of town .
mutalip karaademi , an ethnic albanian who has lived in switzerland for 26 years , was at first pleased when his proposal for a 5m-high -lrb- 16.5ft -rrb- minaret was approved by the local authority .
but following a vociferous campaign against the plans , including a petition with thousands of signatures , the cantonal government in berne delayed the project indefinitely .
" we are very disappointed , " said mr karaademi .
" we just wanted to do our mosque up a bit , with this small minaret and a tea room .
we actually thought it might promote dialogue . "
mr karaademi is also bitter at what he sees as unfair discrimination against his faith .
" i even gave them a written undertaking that we would never make the call to prayer , " he said .
" they seem to think we are all criminals or terrorists - that 's like saying all italians are in the mafia . "
islamic law but supporters of a ban on minarets say they have no intention of preventing anyone from practising their faith .
" we do n't have anything against muslims , " said oskar freysinger , member of parliament for the swiss people 's party .
" but we do n't want minarets .
the minaret is a symbol of a political and aggressive islam , it 's a symbol of islamic law .
the minute you have minarets in europe it means islam will have taken over . "
mr freysinger 's words may sound extreme , even paranoid , but this is a general election year in switzerland , and the campaign against minarets is playing well with voters .
a recent opinion poll for one swiss newspaper found that 43 % of those surveyed were in favour of a ban on minarets .
" we have our civil laws here , " insisted mr freysinger .
" banning minarets would send a clear signal that our european laws , our swiss laws , have to be accepted .
and if you want to live here , you must accept them .
if you do n't , then go back . "
growing resentment it 's a harsh message for swiss muslims , many of whom were born in switzerland .
there are fears that the campaign against minarets will provoke growing resentment against swiss society .
" i think swiss muslims will be angry and bitter over this , " said reinhard schulze , professor of islamic studies at berne university .
" and we know that anger and bitterness among a community can lead to radicalisation , even to militancy . "
the swiss government is extremely nervous about the prospect of militancy among swiss muslims ; three cabinet ministers have already spoken out against the campaign to ban minarets .
there is also a growing fear that the debate will damage switzerland 's traditionally good relations with the arab world .
but the swiss people 's party is powerful .
if the minaret campaign is , as some suspect , a vote-grabbing ploy ahead of october 's general election , then it is a successful one ; the party is riding high in the opinion polls .
a constitutional amendment forbidding minarets will have to be approved in a nationwide referendum .
in the meantime , no minarets are being built anywhere in switzerland ; the controversy has created a situation in which no local planning officer wants to be the first to approve one .
in that respect , the people 's party may have got what it secretly wanted all along , an unofficial ban on minarets .
so for now , switzerland 's muslims will continue to pray in abandoned buildings , many with the growing feeling that they are tolerated only as long as they remain invisible .

an arbitration court judge in irkutsk has thrown out attempts by tnk-bp to stop authorities seizing the licence .
the judge , valery titov , said that the case was outside the court 's jurisdiction .
tnk-bp may now appeal against the ruling .
analysts say the licence dispute is the latest attempt by the kremlin to gain control of russia 's energy supplies .
last year gazprom secured a majority stake in a similarly large russian oil and gas field formerly led by royal dutch shell .
shell and its partners granted gazprom control of the sakhalin 2 project after authorities refused to grant them the necessary environmental certificates .

russian authorities claim tnk-bp is not producing enough gas from the kovykta field .
tnk-bp is confident of the legal merit of its case tnk-bp spokesman they say that under the terms of the licence , kovykta should have been producing nine billion cubic metres of gas per year by 2006 , rather than the less than 2.5 billion cubic metres actually being processed .
tnk-bp says that it can not produce any more because the local region does not require additional supplies and it has been denied an export licence .
kovykta has enough gas reserves to meet global demand for the best part of a year , analysts said .
the licence for the gas field is held by rusia petroleum , which is 63 % owned by tnk-bp .

a report by save the children and glasgow university said there were barriers to youngsters taking part in activities most took for granted .
some children were unable to take advantage of free services because they could not afford the costs of travel , equipment or something to eat .
save the children said quality services needed to be accessible to all .
the report said some children were also being denied access to dentists and local shops .
safety concerns it said schools played a vital role in offering health and leisure opportunities to children from low-income households .
factors which made it harder for such children to use services included poor access to transport , safety concerns , lack of information , lack of self-confidence and limited service provision , the report said .
glasgow university 's fiona wager , the main author of the report said : " for many of the young people i spoke to , it was the first time that they 'd been listened to in this way .
it is a disgrace that 250,000 children in scotland live in poverty douglas hamilton save the children " they have made it clear that they are not accessing services and we need to hear what they are saying so that we know how to remove the barriers they encounter .
" listening to children 's own experiences and perceptions is an important means of increasing our understanding of the issues that children from lower income households in scotland are facing in terms of their access to services . "
douglas hamilton , head of policy and research for save the children , said : " it is a disgrace that 250,000 children in scotland live in poverty .
" what makes it more disgraceful , is that those children are not able to access the services that are supposed to be there to help them . "

mr chipchase 's focus is on the uses to which people put their phones ; where they keep them , how they answer them , and a million other details about our relationships with these devices that have helped shape our world on the street , in homes , in the office , in pockets , handbags , at the marketplace , and in the community - mr chipchase tries to put mobile phone use into the context of the culture and landscape he is in .
his research has included looking at home battery charging services in rural uganda , street charging in kampala , how illiterate people use a mobile and more recently where we keep our phones .
from city bankers to shantytown dwellers , and from hip teens to octogenarian sms fiends , no use of a phone is too trivial ; no detail of a person 's life too insignificant .
human behaviour changes very slowly ; technology changes very quickly jan chipchase " i specialise in human behavioural research .
it often starts with a very simple question like ' what do people carry ? ' .
" this is interesting to nokia because we want to put things in people 's pockets - something of value .
" if you can understand one element of that value then you can understand people 's motivation . "
' secret stuff ' mr chipchase takes a team - designers , psychologists - into different countries around the world , to look at people 's lives in different contexts .
" i want to understand what people do and why , and pretty much in every context .
we want to know the secret stuff as well . "
but why would nokia pay someone like mr chipchase to travel the world and to have all of those experiences ?
where is the value in that ?
" we do this research work to inform and inspire the design stage .
to bring designers into the field so they know whom they are designing for .
" often designers are designing phones for markets they have little experience of - so we want to bring the world to them and them to the world . "
mr chipchase works three to 15 years ahead of the market .
his team carries out research using a method called convergent validity - it is not quantative scientific work but qualitative .
" we deal with informed opinion .
if we do our jobs exceptionally well , then it is very informed opinion . "
human behaviour so where is mobile phone design heading ?
will they get ever smaller , perhaps becoming part of our clothes rather than as a single unit ?
mr chipchase says the important consideration is how people behave , not what the latest technology can do .
" it 's about what to design and when to design , because human behaviour changes very slowly ; technology changes very quickly .
" if i can understand why , for example , a lady in north east china carries her phone on her left wrist , then we can understand others ' motivations . "
he adds : " it 's also about what not to do with design .
we have lots of assumptions about the world around us - nokia is no different .
in asian countries phone straps have become very popular " if we want to remain relevant in all these markets we need to know how our assumptions differ from other people 's . "
to date , mr chipchase has had two patents granted based on his work , and a further 25 are currently being considered .
by 2009 more than four billion people in the world - out of a population of 6.3 billion - are expected to have a mobile phone connection in their lives .
" the challenge for a company like nokia is to sell products to all these markets - all of which have different needs .
" we want to meet the needs people have , rather than just putting technology out into the market place . "
mr chipchase and his team employ a number of techniques - from shadowing people 's lives , talking to as many local people as possible and documenting their lives in different contexts .
" i spend a lot of my time looking into people 's bags and handbags - with their permission , of course .
" there 's a whole load of stuff in life that is worth documenting .
you see it every day but do n't even notice . "
younger person he adds : " we spend as much time as possible being in the places that people do what they do .
the mobile phone is used from when you get up in the morning and is often the last thing you interact with at night . "
he has studied the mobile use of low-income manual workers in china , and spoken to blind people who are experts in using a phone and not having to rely on a screen .
i find buying a bicycle is a great way to stay in touch with people jan chipchase " if we were to try and design a user interface for someone who is not looking at the screen , someone walking along and wanting to get a phone number , then a blind person is the ideal person to speak with . "
typically , mr chipchase is to be found discovering people and cities on a bicycle or on the back of a motorbike .
" i buy a lot of bicycles .
i have huge time pressures when in these places and i want to engage with the local population as much as possible .
" i find buying a bicycle is a great way to stay in touch with people .
we give the bicycles away at end of the study . "
the hardest part of his job is not the jetlag , dealing with bureaucracy or coping with different languages , explains mr chipcase .
" the question is how can we do our job as a large corporation and show people we interact with sufficient respect . "

mobile phones have shaped global communications .
but who shapes mobiles ?
bbc news speaks to jan chipchase , principal researcher at nokia design .
jan chipchase tours the world looking at how people use mobile phones in their everyday lives and , more broadly , how people live .
" this is my office , my workspace , " he says , pointing to a map of the world .
in the last 12 months he has visited 15 countries , carrying out eight full-scale research projects .
mr chipchase 's focus is on the uses to which people put their phones ; where they keep them , how they answer them , and a million other details about our relationships with these devices that have helped shape our world on the street , in homes , in the office , in pockets , handbags , at the marketplace , and in the community - mr chipchase tries to put mobile phone use into the context of the culture and landscape he is in .
his research has included looking at home battery charging services in rural uganda , street charging in kampala , how illiterate people use a mobile and more recently where we keep our phones .
from city bankers to shantytown dwellers , and from hip teens to octogenarian sms fiends , no use of a phone is too trivial ; no detail of a person 's life too insignificant .
human behaviour changes very slowly ; technology changes very quickly jan chipchase " i specialise in human behavioural research .
it often starts with a very simple question like ' what do people carry ? ' .
" this is interesting to nokia because we want to put things in people 's pockets - something of value .
" if you can understand one element of that value then you can understand people 's motivation . "
' secret stuff ' mr chipchase takes a team - designers , psychologists - into different countries around the world , to look at people 's lives in different contexts .
" i want to understand what people do and why , and pretty much in every context .
we want to know the secret stuff as well . "
but why would nokia pay someone like mr chipchase to travel the world and to have all of those experiences ?
where is the value in that ?
" we do this research work to inform and inspire the design stage .
to bring designers into the field so they know whom they are designing for .
" often designers are designing phones for markets they have little experience of - so we want to bring the world to them and them to the world . "
mr chipchase works three to 15 years ahead of the market .
his team carries out research using a method called convergent validity - it is not quantative scientific work but qualitative .
" we deal with informed opinion .
if we do our jobs exceptionally well , then it is very informed opinion . "
human behaviour so where is mobile phone design heading ?
will they get ever smaller , perhaps becoming part of our clothes rather than as a single unit ?
mr chipchase says the important consideration is how people behave , not what the latest technology can do .
" it 's about what to design and when to design , because human behaviour changes very slowly ; technology changes very quickly .
" if i can understand why , for example , a lady in north east china carries her phone on her left wrist , then we can understand others ' motivations . "
he adds : " it 's also about what not to do with design .
we have lots of assumptions about the world around us - nokia is no different .
in asian countries phone straps have become very popular " if we want to remain relevant in all these markets we need to know how our assumptions differ from other people 's . "
to date , mr chipchase has had two patents granted based on his work , and a further 25 are currently being considered .
by 2009 more than four billion people in the world - out of a population of 6.3 billion - are expected to have a mobile phone connection in their lives .
" the challenge for a company like nokia is to sell products to all these markets - all of which have different needs .
" we want to meet the needs people have , rather than just putting technology out into the market place . "
mr chipchase and his team employ a number of techniques - from shadowing people 's lives , talking to as many local people as possible and documenting their lives in different contexts .
" i spend a lot of my time looking into people 's bags and handbags - with their permission , of course .

mobile phones have shaped global communications .
but who shapes mobiles ?
bbc news speaks to jan chipchase , principal researcher at nokia design .
jan chipchase tours the world looking at how people use mobile phones in their everyday lives and , more broadly , how people live .
" this is my office , my workspace , " he says , pointing to a map of the world .
in the last 12 months he has visited 15 countries , carrying out eight full-scale research projects .
mr chipchase 's focus is on the uses to which people put their phones ; where they keep them , how they answer them , and a million other details about our relationships with these devices that have helped shape our world on the street , in homes , in the office , in pockets , handbags , at the marketplace , and in the community - mr chipchase tries to put mobile phone use into the context of the culture and landscape he is in .
his research has included looking at home battery charging services in rural uganda , street charging in kampala , how illiterate people use a mobile and more recently where we keep our phones .
from city bankers to shantytown dwellers , and from hip teens to octogenarian sms fiends , no use of a phone is too trivial ; no detail of a person 's life too insignificant .
human behaviour changes very slowly ; technology changes very quickly jan chipchase " i specialise in human behavioural research .
it often starts with a very simple question like ' what do people carry ? ' .
" this is interesting to nokia because we want to put things in people 's pockets - something of value .
" if you can understand one element of that value then you can understand people 's motivation . "
' secret stuff ' mr chipchase takes a team - designers , psychologists - into different countries around the world , to look at people 's lives in different contexts .
" i want to understand what people do and why , and pretty much in every context .
we want to know the secret stuff as well . "
but why would nokia pay someone like mr chipchase to travel the world and to have all of those experiences ?
where is the value in that ?
" we do this research work to inform and inspire the design stage .
to bring designers into the field so they know whom they are designing for .
" often designers are designing phones for markets they have little experience of - so we want to bring the world to them and them to the world . "
mr chipchase works three to 15 years ahead of the market .
his team carries out research using a method called convergent validity - it is not quantative scientific work but qualitative .
" we deal with informed opinion .
if we do our jobs exceptionally well , then it is very informed opinion . "
human behaviour so where is mobile phone design heading ?
will they get ever smaller , perhaps becoming part of our clothes rather than as a single unit ?
mr chipchase says the important consideration is how people behave , not what the latest technology can do .
" it 's about what to design and when to design , because human behaviour changes very slowly ; technology changes very quickly .
" if i can understand why , for example , a lady in north east china carries her phone on her left wrist , then we can understand others ' motivations . "
he adds : " it 's also about what not to do with design .
we have lots of assumptions about the world around us - nokia is no different .
in asian countries phone straps have become very popular " if we want to remain relevant in all these markets we need to know how our assumptions differ from other people 's . "
to date , mr chipchase has had two patents granted based on his work , and a further 25 are currently being considered .
by 2009 more than four billion people in the world - out of a population of 6.3 billion - are expected to have a mobile phone connection in their lives .
" the challenge for a company like nokia is to sell products to all these markets - all of which have different needs .
" we want to meet the needs people have , rather than just putting technology out into the market place . "
mr chipchase and his team employ a number of techniques - from shadowing people 's lives , talking to as many local people as possible and documenting their lives in different contexts .
" i spend a lot of my time looking into people 's bags and handbags - with their permission , of course .
" there 's a whole load of stuff in life that is worth documenting .
you see it every day but do n't even notice . "
younger person he adds : " we spend as much time as possible being in the places that people do what they do .
the mobile phone is used from when you get up in the morning and is often the last thing you interact with at night . "
he has studied the mobile use of low-income manual workers in china , and spoken to blind people who are experts in using a phone and not having to rely on a screen .
i find buying a bicycle is a great way to stay in touch with people jan chipchase " if we were to try and design a user interface for someone who is not looking at the screen , someone walking along and wanting to get a phone number , then a blind person is the ideal person to speak with . "
typically , mr chipchase is to be found discovering people and cities on a bicycle or on the back of a motorbike .
" i buy a lot of bicycles .
i have huge time pressures when in these places and i want to engage with the local population as much as possible .
" i find buying a bicycle is a great way to stay in touch with people .
we give the bicycles away at end of the study . "
the hardest part of his job is not the jetlag , dealing with bureaucracy or coping with different languages , explains mr chipcase .
" the question is how can we do our job as a large corporation and show people we interact with sufficient respect . "

the labels will detail alcoholic units and recommended safe drinking levels .
bottles and cans currently have alcohol percentages , but only some state what this equals in alcoholic units .
public health minister caroline flint says exactly what the labels will say is not decided , but the warnings will not be as strong as for cigarettes .
the measure was first proposed three years ago , but both sides have struggled to agree on a format .
it is not known how many drinks firms will sign up for the scheme , but ministers said if the industry did not comply , the government would introduce legislation .
calculating units the proposed warning labels will include words such as " know your limits " or " drink responsibly " , and the number of units each drink contains .
they will also warn that drinking alcohol should be avoided if pregnant or trying to conceive .
they will also give the web address for the education campaign group drink aware .
more than 7m people drink more than the recommended daily amounts - three to four units for men and two to three units for women .
a small glass of wine , half a pint of beer or one measure of spirits are often taken as being one unit , but it depends on the percentage of alcohol the drink contains .
with some strong beers and ciders , a pint or a large bottle can add up to three units or more . "
in terms of cans and bottles , it 's a very good first step " don shenkar alcohol concern send us your comments ms flint said : " this landmark , voluntary agreement will help people calculate , at a glance , how much they are drinking and whether they are staying within sensible drinking guidelines ...
" this is about helping people to make the right choices . "
while the agreement has been reached only by health ministers in england , it will effectively apply to the uk as manufacturers are unlikely to take a different tack depending on where it is sold .
kevin hawkins , of the british retail consortium , said the industry wanted to take a " responsible attitude to selling alcohol " and was committed to the system .
" retailers have been actively involved in the development of this label and the concise and simple way it sets out information , " he said .
pubs call alcohol concern welcomed the scheme but said it did not go far enough .
don shenkar , director of policy and services for the charity , said : " we 'd like there to be more information in pubs and bars , in terms of the sensible drinking limits there .
" but in terms of cans and bottles , it 's a very good first step . "
however , annette fleming , chief executive of aquarius , a midlands-based alcohol and drugs charity , questioned how effective the labelling would be .
she told bbc radio five live : " it begs the question , that once people have had one drink out of a bottle , are they really going to be bothered to read the tiny print that talks about units ?
" i 'm not sure it will actually make a difference . "

the labels will detail alcoholic units and recommended safe drinking levels .
bottles and cans currently have alcohol percentages , but only some state what this equals in alcoholic units .
public health minister caroline flint says exactly what the labels will say is not decided , but the warnings will not be as strong as for cigarettes .
the measure was first proposed three years ago , but both sides have struggled to agree on a format .
it is not known how many drinks firms will sign up for the scheme , but ministers said if the industry did not comply , the government would introduce legislation .
calculating units the proposed warning labels will include words such as " know your limits " or " drink responsibly " , and the number of units each drink contains .
they will also warn that drinking alcohol should be avoided if pregnant or trying to conceive .
they will also give the web address for the education campaign group drink aware .
more than 7m people drink more than the recommended daily amounts - three to four units for men and two to three units for women .
a small glass of wine , half a pint of beer or one measure of spirits are often taken as being one unit , but it depends on the percentage of alcohol the drink contains .
with some strong beers and ciders , a pint or a large bottle can add up to three units or more .
in terms of cans and bottles , it 's a very good first step don shenkar alcohol concern send us your comments ms flint said : " this landmark , voluntary agreement will help people calculate , at a glance , how much they are drinking and whether they are staying within sensible drinking guidelines ...
" this is about helping people to make the right choices . "
while the agreement has been reached only by health ministers in england , it will effectively apply to the uk as manufacturers are unlikely to take a different tack depending on where it is sold .
kevin hawkins , of the british retail consortium , said the industry wanted to take a " responsible attitude to selling alcohol " and was committed to the system .
" retailers have been actively involved in the development of this label and the concise and simple way it sets out information , " he said .
pubs call alcohol concern welcomed the scheme but said it did not go far enough .
don shenkar , director of policy and services for the charity , said : " we 'd like there to be more information in pubs and bars , in terms of the sensible drinking limits there .
" but in terms of cans and bottles , it 's a very good first step . "
however , annette fleming , chief executive of aquarius , a midlands-based alcohol and drugs charity , questioned how effective the labelling would be .
she told bbc radio five live : " it begs the question , that once people have had one drink out of a bottle , are they really going to be bothered to read the tiny print that talks about units ?

dr lloyd spoke after a liberal democrat u-turn rekindled a " rainbow alliance " with plaid and the conservatives .
assembly lib dem leader mike german said he had no idea how long the deal would take , but wanted to deliver it .

four plaid ams have come out against coalition , and before any deal is agreed it will have to be approved by the party 's ruling body .
the plaid national council is expected to meet in july to discuss it .
dr lloyd said : " we have internal differences of opinion but labour will not split us on this .

dai lloyd , chair of the plaid ams , said they would not wait " months and months " to oust first minister rhodri morgan .
dr lloyd spoke after a liberal democrat u-turn rekindled a " rainbow alliance " with plaid and the conservatives .
assembly lib dem leader mike german said he had no idea how long the deal would take , but wanted to deliver it .
mr morgan was reappointed to wales 's top post last friday after the coalition agreement between the three other parties appeared to have collapsed when it was rejected by the lib dems .
but the following day lib dems voted again , this time to go ahead with the alliance .
labour has a minority government , with 26 of the 60 seats , and if the other parties unite , they can remove mr morgan with a vote of no confidence .

and she most certainly did not look the part of a mafiosa herself - which is what the italian authorities say she became , helping to run her mobster husband 's network .
the manchester vowels were as pronounced as if she had never left the north west .
and the hair-do was long past its best .
she had reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by me in agrigento jail , perched atop one of those hills that this holiday island is famous for with the most spectacular panorama of lemon groves and countryside rolling out below us .
this was home to about 100 mafiosi but ann hathaway wanted to divorce herself in the public 's mind from any of them , following the lurid headlines that appeared in the newspapers after she was extradited from manchester in january charged with mafia association .
i 've seen every prison in italy probably , with having my husband in prison , and my two brother-in-laws as well ann hathaway having accepted a conviction in return for her freedom , ann hathaway was about to be released after our interview .
her brother lee had joked that because of the state of her hair , she would be worried she might look like the most notorious woman manchester has produced in living memory - myra hindley .
as we waited for the cameraman to frame his shot against a blank prison wall , i assured her she did not .
how did agrigento compare to holloway where she had been held for a few weeks pending her extradition , i wondered ?
i asked because we had just had a very agreeable lunch of spaghetti al pomodoro , roast veal , spinach and melon in the prison canteen .
" no comparison , " she said , " holloway was like a grand hotel . "
john reid please note .
normal life how would she adjust to the drizzle of the north west -lrb- compared to italy -rrb- , and a life on benefits , a culture she had left behind 28 years ago when she was 17 ?
she said she could not wait .
" i just want to get back to england , back to my normal life , be with my kids , my mum .
" i 've seen every prison in italy probably , with having my husband in prison , and my two brother-in-laws as well . "
she certainly looked as if she had had enough of being married to the mob .
and yet her story of ignorance and denials of collusion with a branch of one of the most sinister and secret organisations in the world , does not altogether hang together .
happier times .
ann hathaway and antonio rinzivillo 's wedding day for nearly 28 years in italy , she was the closest person in the world to antonio rinzivillo , convicted murderer , drugs trafficker , and extortionist .
yet she insisted , once the cameras rolled , she had never once asked him a single question about any of this : " honestly ? " , i asked ?
" never , " she said .
" and even if i would have asked him , he 's not the sort of person that would have turned round and told me . "
ummh .
what about the nice house , the cars , the jewellery and the restaurants ?
where had all the money for that come from , given that she did not work for much of her married life and husband antonio was behind bars for most of it ?
from friends of her husband , she said , with whom he had been " in business " .
what kind of business ?
" building and construction " .
it turns out that one of those friends was angelo bernascone , now self-confessed launderer-in-chief of the rinzovillo clan 's dirty money and under police protection for fear of execution by the rinzivillos .
sicilian mentality the italian authorities say that telephone intercepts show that ann hathaway was demanding around £ 80,000 from bernascone for a deposit on a flat in rome .
buying property has been used to launder mafia money .
this demand was an instruction relayed from antonio 's brother gino , whom ann also regularly visited in jail .
it is because of this and other conversations which the intercepts reveal , that the italians say she was helping the rinzivillo clan to continue to run their network from jail .
she categorically denies this .
one thing is for sure .
back in the bosom of the rinzivillo clan on the afternoon of her freedom , ann hathaway was treated as if she was a blood relative .
she flipped like a light switch between those flat manchester vowels and the fluent dialect of sicilian italian .
" she has the sicilian mentality " antonio 's sister anna told me .
she too has only just been released from jail .
and what is the sicilian mentality i wondered ?
" i 'm one of them ones , " replied ann covering her eyes , ears and mouth .
" see no .. " , then she stopped but it was obvious what she meant - see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil .
i could not have put it better myself .

as we waited for the cameraman to frame his shot against a blank prison wall , i assured her she did not .
how did agrigento compare to holloway where she had been held for a few weeks pending her extradition , i wondered ?
i asked because we had just had a very agreeable lunch of spaghetti al pomodoro , roast veal , spinach and melon in the prison canteen .
" no comparison , " she said , " holloway was like a grand hotel . "
john reid please note .
normal life how would she adjust to the drizzle of the north west -lrb- compared to italy -rrb- , and a life on benefits , a culture she had left behind 28 years ago when she was 17 ?
she said she could not wait .
" i just want to get back to england , back to my normal life , be with my kids , my mum .
" i 've seen every prison in italy probably , with having my husband in prison , and my two brother-in-laws as well . "
she certainly looked as if she had had enough of being married to the mob .
and yet her story of ignorance and denials of collusion with a branch of one of the most sinister and secret organisations in the world , does not altogether hang together .
happier times .
ann hathaway and antonio rinzivillo 's wedding day for nearly 28 years in italy , she was the closest person in the world to antonio rinzivillo , convicted murderer , drugs trafficker , and extortionist .
yet she insisted , once the cameras rolled , she had never once asked him a single question about any of this : " honestly ? " , i asked ?
" never , " she said .
" and even if i would have asked him , he 's not the sort of person that would have turned round and told me . "
ummh .
what about the nice house , the cars , the jewellery and the restaurants ?
where had all the money for that come from , given that she did not work for much of her married life and husband antonio was behind bars for most of it ?
from friends of her husband , she said , with whom he had been " in business " .
what kind of business ?
" building and construction " .
it turns out that one of those friends was angelo bernascone , now self-confessed launderer-in-chief of the rinzovillo clan 's dirty money and under police protection for fear of execution by the rinzivillos .
sicilian mentality the italian authorities say that telephone intercepts show that ann hathaway was demanding around £ 80,000 from bernascone for a deposit on a flat in rome .
buying property has been used to launder mafia money .
this demand was an instruction relayed from antonio 's brother gino , whom ann also regularly visited in jail .
it is because of this and other conversations which the intercepts reveal , that the italians say she was helping the rinzivillo clan to continue to run their network from jail .
she categorically denies this .
one thing is for sure .
back in the bosom of the rinzivillo clan on the afternoon of her freedom , ann hathaway was treated as if she was a blood relative .
she flipped like a light switch between those flat manchester vowels and the fluent dialect of sicilian italian .
" she has the sicilian mentality " antonio 's sister anna told me .
she too has only just been released from jail .
and what is the sicilian mentality i wondered ?
" i 'm one of them ones , " replied ann covering her eyes , ears and mouth .
" see no .. " , then she stopped but it was obvious what she meant - see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil .
i could not have put it better myself .
