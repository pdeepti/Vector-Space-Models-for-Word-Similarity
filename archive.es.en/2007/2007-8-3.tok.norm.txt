both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .
germany has offered 200 soldiers to supply logistical support to the au force but has ruled out any direct participation in the peacekeeping force . article based on news reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard . " you could read more from the classified documents in the press than what was available to the committee , " he said . going over the top ? opposition free democrat deputy max stadler accused the legislature of " going over the top " in targeting the journalists and said the people who passed on the information to them were the ones who were liable of being prosecuted . " i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom . " the aim was to " intimidate journalists and their informants , " he told ard . the television channel said journalists from many of germany 's leading publications , including the news magazine der spiegel , the weekly die zeit and the dailies süddeutsche zeitung , frankfurter rundschau , die tageszeitung and die welt were under investigation by prosecutors . opposition greens deputy hans-christian ströbele , a member of the parliamentary panel , said he had voted against launching an investigation into the leaks , " because i was a afraid that such a process would be directed against journalists .

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .

" the contract is ready to be signed , " a spokeswoman for mbda , the missiles systems subsidiary of eads , said in paris . a second contract worth 128 million euros for communication systems was also close to completion , she said . first arms deal it is the first arms agreement with a european country since the lifting in 2004 of a european embargo on weapons sales to libya , the source added .
french defense minister herve morin confirmed to rtl television channel earlier friday that libya had made a declaration of its intention to buy milan-type missiles and radio systems . a multi-ministerial commission had approved the arms deals in february .
france would be the first country to deliver weapons to libya following the end of an international arms embargo on the north african country . meanwhile , the libyans were not officially confirming the deal that president moammar gaddafi 's son saif had revealed earlier in the week to the french press . " gadhafi 's son does not exercise any official office in this country , which is why what he says is not binding for the state , " arabic newspaper al-sharq al-aswat reported friday , citing a libyan government official . quid pro quo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian nurses returned to their homeland on july 24 saif al-islam gadhafi had told le monde newspaper that a deal had been reached between the french and libyan governments which led to the release last week of six bulgarian medics who had spent eight years in libyan custody - some of it on death row - for deliberately infecting 400 children with hiv . the five nurses and one palestinian-born doctor had been " scapegoats , " saif said , adding that he had never believed they were guilty . experts had also cast doubt on their convictions , saying poor hygiene had led to the infections . a foundation led by saif reached an agreement with bulgaria and the european union in july whereby the families of the infected children would receive compensation , which led to the medics ' ultimate extradition to bulgaria last week where they were pardoned . the government in sofia announced thursday that it would forgive libyan debts of 41 million euros which would be transferred to the international fund for the support of aids-infected children in the libyan port city of benghazi . france rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy visited gadhafi shortly after the bulgarian nurses were released france has been criticized for signing a memorandum since the medics were released to deliver a nuclear power station to libya for civilian use . french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied that there was any connection between the nuclear agreement and the release of the medics . france 's opposition parties have demanded that a commission be set up to look into the arms deals .

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard . " you could read more from the classified documents in the press than what was available to the committee , " he said . going over the top ? opposition free democrat deputy max stadler accused the legislature of " going over the top " in targeting the journalists and said the people who passed on the information to them were the ones who were liable of being prosecuted . " i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom . " the aim was to " intimidate journalists and their informants , " he told ard . the television channel said journalists from many of germany 's leading publications , including the news magazine der spiegel , the weekly die zeit and the dailies süddeutsche zeitung , frankfurter rundschau , die tageszeitung and die welt were under investigation by prosecutors . opposition greens deputy hans-christian ströbele , a member of the parliamentary panel , said he had voted against launching an investigation into the leaks , " because i was a afraid that such a process would be directed against journalists .

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .
while it 's not clear whether stephan s. , a 43-year-old unemployed truck driver from berlin , was ever aware of this change in the law , he seems to have forgotten that ordering restaurant meals and refusing to pay for them afterwards is still frowned upon .
the 160-kilogram -lrb- 340-pound -rrb- guy should have realized that something was n't quite right when a judge sentenced him to one year in jail on probation for eating too many schnitzels without paying for them .
on thursday , however , he was back in court after stuffing himself at 64 further restaurants , whose owners complained that they were left with some 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,100 -rrb- in unpaid bills as a result .
that 's why the judge ordered him to spend 18 months in prison , prompting stephan s. to complain that he had n't brought his toothbrush along .
despite the potential for bad breath , s. might have secretly rejoiced about the verdict - after all he 'll be getting free food for a year and a half without having to worry about angry waiters chasing him .
odds are he 's already checked the schedule for schnitzel day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .

but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they should n't be too hesitant about avoiding new risks , says dw 's karl zawadzky . it 's better to be safe than sorry .
but the international financial sector has largely suspended this old piece of popular wisdom in the past years .
gold diggers in hedge funds , investment banks and private equity companies have raked in millions and billions for years with increasingly risky ventures and credit constructions . the banks earned well in the process , too .
they put together credit packages often worth billions for the deals of the alleged financial geniuses , securitizing them and passing the risks on to the capital market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has now become apparent that , once again , greed has deactivated the mind .
everyone only saw the opportunities and faded out the risks .
it could n't go on like this in the long run and has promptly gone sour . every day , the financial sector conveys new evil tidings , especially from the united states .
the subprime mortgage market is falling apart , hedge funds are insolvent , billions of dollars wiped out , investors have lost their money and banks have been forced to close . in germany , the crisis has also reached the first bank .
in principle , it 's a small bank for financing medium-sized businesses .
it was supposed to be a solid thing - and it is . but the management at düsseldorf 's ikb deutsche industriebank could n't resist the temptation of big money .
the bank invested on a grand scale in funds with us subprime mortgages .
it worked for a long time and brought nice profits , which is why a growing wheel continued to be turned . but when the market toppled , the bank was financially overwhelmed .
if ikb had collapsed , it could have sparked a snowball effect with incalculable consequences for the german and international financial markets .
that 's why ikb 's shareholder , the state-owned kfw banking group , is vouching for ikb risks of over 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- .
the major german banks , as well as mutual banks and credit unions have said they will participate in this rescue measure - and not out of the goodness of their hearts , but rather as self-protection . for the time being , one banking crisis has been averted .
but who knows what else is going to swash across the atlantic .
internationally , the risks are being newly evaluated and at a much higher level .
the stock markets are already a good step away from their peak levels reached just a few weeks ago .
but the correction this time is not based on a bubble on the stock exchange , but rather on a credit crisis in the united states that has led to losses at banks around the world . the reassessment of risks as such is not bad , but rather a good thing .
it 's more difficult for financial investors to get inexpensive loans worth billions for their purchases .
risk premiums are being demanded .
that can only be welcomed in the interest of stability for the financial sector . of course , the danger of exaggeration exists here , as well .
if the banks are hesitant not only in awarding large credits to speculators and non-solvent home buyers , but also make perfectly normal business financing more difficult , the crisis in the financial sector could penetrate the real economy .
though it 's better to be safe than sorry , some willingness to take risk should exist in the financial sector . karl zawadzky is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard . " you could read more from the classified documents in the press than what was available to the committee , " he said . going over the top ? opposition free democrat deputy max stadler accused the legislature of " going over the top " in targeting the journalists and said the people who passed on the information to them were the ones who were liable of being prosecuted . " i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom . " the aim was to " intimidate journalists and their informants , " he told ard . the television channel said journalists from many of germany 's leading publications , including the news magazine der spiegel , the weekly die zeit and the dailies süddeutsche zeitung , frankfurter rundschau , die tageszeitung and die welt were under investigation by prosecutors . opposition greens deputy hans-christian ströbele , a member of the parliamentary panel , said he had voted against launching an investigation into the leaks , " because i was a afraid that such a process would be directed against journalists .

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard . " you could read more from the classified documents in the press than what was available to the committee , " he said . going over the top ? opposition free democrat deputy max stadler accused the legislature of " going over the top " in targeting the journalists and said the people who passed on the information to them were the ones who were liable of being prosecuted . " i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom . " the aim was to " intimidate journalists and their informants , " he told ard . the television channel said journalists from many of germany 's leading publications , including the news magazine der spiegel , the weekly die zeit and the dailies süddeutsche zeitung , frankfurter rundschau , die tageszeitung and die welt were under investigation by prosecutors . opposition greens deputy hans-christian ströbele , a member of the parliamentary panel , said he had voted against launching an investigation into the leaks , " because i was a afraid that such a process would be directed against journalists .

" the contract is ready to be signed , " a spokeswoman for mbda , the missiles systems subsidiary of eads , said in paris . a second contract worth 128 million euros for communication systems was also close to completion , she said . first arms deal it is the first arms agreement with a european country since the lifting in 2004 of a european embargo on weapons sales to libya , the source added .
french defense minister herve morin confirmed to rtl television channel earlier friday that libya had made a declaration of its intention to buy milan-type missiles and radio systems . a multi-ministerial commission had approved the arms deals in february .

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .
focus on history hagenow said that the finance minister and others had no reason to worry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german emigration center in bremerhaven " what we 've done so far should make it clear that we 're not planning to build an entertainment park , " she said , adding that the german emigration center in bremerhaven , which was designed by her firm , had just won the 2007 european museum of the year award .
" our aim is to convey history in a way that 's scientifically sound and attractive for tourists at the same time , " she said .

" the contract is ready to be signed , " a spokeswoman for mbda , the missiles systems subsidiary of eads , said in paris . a second contract worth 128 million euros for communication systems was also close to completion , she said . first arms deal it is the first arms agreement with a european country since the lifting in 2004 of a european embargo on weapons sales to libya , the source added .
french defense minister herve morin confirmed to rtl television channel earlier friday that libya had made a declaration of its intention to buy milan-type missiles and radio systems . a multi-ministerial commission had approved the arms deals in february .
france would be the first country to deliver weapons to libya following the end of an international arms embargo on the north african country . meanwhile , the libyans were not officially confirming the deal that president moammar gaddafi 's son saif had revealed earlier in the week to the french press . " gadhafi 's son does not exercise any official office in this country , which is why what he says is not binding for the state , " arabic newspaper al-sharq al-aswat reported friday , citing a libyan government official . quid pro quo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian nurses returned to their homeland on july 24 saif al-islam gadhafi had told le monde newspaper that a deal had been reached between the french and libyan governments which led to the release last week of six bulgarian medics who had spent eight years in libyan custody - some of it on death row - for deliberately infecting 400 children with hiv . the five nurses and one palestinian-born doctor had been " scapegoats , " saif said , adding that he had never believed they were guilty . experts had also cast doubt on their convictions , saying poor hygiene had led to the infections . a foundation led by saif reached an agreement with bulgaria and the european union in july whereby the families of the infected children would receive compensation , which led to the medics ' ultimate extradition to bulgaria last week where they were pardoned . the government in sofia announced thursday that it would forgive libyan debts of 41 million euros which would be transferred to the international fund for the support of aids-infected children in the libyan port city of benghazi . france rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy visited gadhafi shortly after the bulgarian nurses were released france has been criticized for signing a memorandum since the medics were released to deliver a nuclear power station to libya for civilian use . french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied that there was any connection between the nuclear agreement and the release of the medics . france 's opposition parties have demanded that a commission be set up to look into the arms deals .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .
while it 's not clear whether stephan s. , a 43-year-old unemployed truck driver from berlin , was ever aware of this change in the law , he seems to have forgotten that ordering restaurant meals and refusing to pay for them afterwards is still frowned upon .
the 160-kilogram -lrb- 340-pound -rrb- guy should have realized that something was n't quite right when a judge sentenced him to one year in jail on probation for eating too many schnitzels without paying for them .
on thursday , however , he was back in court after stuffing himself at 64 further restaurants , whose owners complained that they were left with some 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,100 -rrb- in unpaid bills as a result .
that 's why the judge ordered him to spend 18 months in prison , prompting stephan s. to complain that he had n't brought his toothbrush along .
despite the potential for bad breath , s. might have secretly rejoiced about the verdict - after all he 'll be getting free food for a year and a half without having to worry about angry waiters chasing him .
odds are he 's already checked the schedule for schnitzel day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans may have a certain reputation for orderliness , but there 's at least one gastronomical invention that turns them into ruthless beasts : the buffet .

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .
germany has offered 200 soldiers to supply logistical support to the au force but has ruled out any direct participation in the peacekeeping force . article based on news reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .
while it 's not clear whether stephan s. , a 43-year-old unemployed truck driver from berlin , was ever aware of this change in the law , he seems to have forgotten that ordering restaurant meals and refusing to pay for them afterwards is still frowned upon .
the 160-kilogram -lrb- 340-pound -rrb- guy should have realized that something was n't quite right when a judge sentenced him to one year in jail on probation for eating too many schnitzels without paying for them .
on thursday , however , he was back in court after stuffing himself at 64 further restaurants , whose owners complained that they were left with some 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,100 -rrb- in unpaid bills as a result .
that 's why the judge ordered him to spend 18 months in prison , prompting stephan s. to complain that he had n't brought his toothbrush along .

" gadhafi 's son does not exercise any official office in this country , which is why what he says is not binding for the state , " arabic newspaper al-sharq al-aswat reported friday , citing a libyan government official . quid pro quo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian nurses returned to their homeland on july 24 saif al-islam gadhafi had told le monde newspaper that a deal had been reached between the french and libyan governments which led to the release last week of six bulgarian medics who had spent eight years in libyan custody - some of it on death row - for deliberately infecting 400 children with hiv . the five nurses and one palestinian-born doctor had been " scapegoats , " saif said , adding that he had never believed they were guilty . experts had also cast doubt on their convictions , saying poor hygiene had led to the infections . a foundation led by saif reached an agreement with bulgaria and the european union in july whereby the families of the infected children would receive compensation , which led to the medics ' ultimate extradition to bulgaria last week where they were pardoned . the government in sofia announced thursday that it would forgive libyan debts of 41 million euros which would be transferred to the international fund for the support of aids-infected children in the libyan port city of benghazi . france rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy visited gadhafi shortly after the bulgarian nurses were released france has been criticized for signing a memorandum since the medics were released to deliver a nuclear power station to libya for civilian use . french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied that there was any connection between the nuclear agreement and the release of the medics . france 's opposition parties have demanded that a commission be set up to look into the arms deals .

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .
while it 's not clear whether stephan s. , a 43-year-old unemployed truck driver from berlin , was ever aware of this change in the law , he seems to have forgotten that ordering restaurant meals and refusing to pay for them afterwards is still frowned upon .
the 160-kilogram -lrb- 340-pound -rrb- guy should have realized that something was n't quite right when a judge sentenced him to one year in jail on probation for eating too many schnitzels without paying for them .
on thursday , however , he was back in court after stuffing himself at 64 further restaurants , whose owners complained that they were left with some 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,100 -rrb- in unpaid bills as a result .
that 's why the judge ordered him to spend 18 months in prison , prompting stephan s. to complain that he had n't brought his toothbrush along .
despite the potential for bad breath , s. might have secretly rejoiced about the verdict - after all he 'll be getting free food for a year and a half without having to worry about angry waiters chasing him .
odds are he 's already checked the schedule for schnitzel day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .

the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 03.08.2007 " terrorists score a major victory if they silence us " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have archaic social ideas , but the taliban are using modern propaganda tools jo groebel , head of the german digital institute in berlin , spoke with dw-world.de about the taliban 's increasing manipulation of the western media to further its own goals . in recent days , the german government has lashed out at the taliban 's " wicked propaganda " and accused the islamist terror group of waging a " media war " against the western world .
the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .

" the contract is ready to be signed , " a spokeswoman for mbda , the missiles systems subsidiary of eads , said in paris . a second contract worth 128 million euros for communication systems was also close to completion , she said . first arms deal it is the first arms agreement with a european country since the lifting in 2004 of a european embargo on weapons sales to libya , the source added .

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .
germany has offered 200 soldiers to supply logistical support to the au force but has ruled out any direct participation in the peacekeeping force . article based on news reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .

the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 03.08.2007 " terrorists score a major victory if they silence us " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have archaic social ideas , but the taliban are using modern propaganda tools jo groebel , head of the german digital institute in berlin , spoke with dw-world.de about the taliban 's increasing manipulation of the western media to further its own goals . in recent days , the german government has lashed out at the taliban 's " wicked propaganda " and accused the islamist terror group of waging a " media war " against the western world .
the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .
while it 's not clear whether stephan s. , a 43-year-old unemployed truck driver from berlin , was ever aware of this change in the law , he seems to have forgotten that ordering restaurant meals and refusing to pay for them afterwards is still frowned upon .
the 160-kilogram -lrb- 340-pound -rrb- guy should have realized that something was n't quite right when a judge sentenced him to one year in jail on probation for eating too many schnitzels without paying for them .
on thursday , however , he was back in court after stuffing himself at 64 further restaurants , whose owners complained that they were left with some 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,100 -rrb- in unpaid bills as a result .
that 's why the judge ordered him to spend 18 months in prison , prompting stephan s. to complain that he had n't brought his toothbrush along .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 03.08.2007 royal descendants take on tourism at neuschwanstein castle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most neuschwanstein visitors overlook hohenschwangau , which sits to the right bavaria 's neuschwanstein castle is flooded by tourists , but there 's little to do for visitors once they 've checked out the world-famous building .
descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .
focus on history hagenow said that the finance minister and others had no reason to worry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german emigration center in bremerhaven " what we 've done so far should make it clear that we 're not planning to build an entertainment park , " she said , adding that the german emigration center in bremerhaven , which was designed by her firm , had just won the 2007 european museum of the year award .
" our aim is to convey history in a way that 's scientifically sound and attractive for tourists at the same time , " she said .
town council members of schwangau , where both castles are located , are expected to decide on the proposals in late october . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 03.08.2007 eu mobile phone users benefit from lower prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile calling throughout the eu member states has become cheaper the deadline for the implementation of the eurotariff passed , and it has now become a binding law among eu member states .
some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the contract is ready to be signed , " a spokeswoman for mbda , the missiles systems subsidiary of eads , said in paris . a second contract worth 128 million euros for communication systems was also close to completion , she said . first arms deal it is the first arms agreement with a european country since the lifting in 2004 of a european embargo on weapons sales to libya , the source added .
french defense minister herve morin confirmed to rtl television channel earlier friday that libya had made a declaration of its intention to buy milan-type missiles and radio systems . a multi-ministerial commission had approved the arms deals in february .
france would be the first country to deliver weapons to libya following the end of an international arms embargo on the north african country . meanwhile , the libyans were not officially confirming the deal that president moammar gaddafi 's son saif had revealed earlier in the week to the french press .

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard . " you could read more from the classified documents in the press than what was available to the committee , " he said . going over the top ? opposition free democrat deputy max stadler accused the legislature of " going over the top " in targeting the journalists and said the people who passed on the information to them were the ones who were liable of being prosecuted . " i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom . " the aim was to " intimidate journalists and their informants , " he told ard . the television channel said journalists from many of germany 's leading publications , including the news magazine der spiegel , the weekly die zeit and the dailies süddeutsche zeitung , frankfurter rundschau , die tageszeitung and die welt were under investigation by prosecutors . opposition greens deputy hans-christian ströbele , a member of the parliamentary panel , said he had voted against launching an investigation into the leaks , " because i was a afraid that such a process would be directed against journalists .

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard . " you could read more from the classified documents in the press than what was available to the committee , " he said . going over the top ? opposition free democrat deputy max stadler accused the legislature of " going over the top " in targeting the journalists and said the people who passed on the information to them were the ones who were liable of being prosecuted . " i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom . " the aim was to " intimidate journalists and their informants , " he told ard . the television channel said journalists from many of germany 's leading publications , including the news magazine der spiegel , the weekly die zeit and the dailies süddeutsche zeitung , frankfurter rundschau , die tageszeitung and die welt were under investigation by prosecutors . opposition greens deputy hans-christian ströbele , a member of the parliamentary panel , said he had voted against launching an investigation into the leaks , " because i was a afraid that such a process would be directed against journalists .

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard . " you could read more from the classified documents in the press than what was available to the committee , " he said . going over the top ? opposition free democrat deputy max stadler accused the legislature of " going over the top " in targeting the journalists and said the people who passed on the information to them were the ones who were liable of being prosecuted . " i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom . " the aim was to " intimidate journalists and their informants , " he told ard . the television channel said journalists from many of germany 's leading publications , including the news magazine der spiegel , the weekly die zeit and the dailies süddeutsche zeitung , frankfurter rundschau , die tageszeitung and die welt were under investigation by prosecutors . opposition greens deputy hans-christian ströbele , a member of the parliamentary panel , said he had voted against launching an investigation into the leaks , " because i was a afraid that such a process would be directed against journalists .

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .
germany has offered 200 soldiers to supply logistical support to the au force but has ruled out any direct participation in the peacekeeping force . article based on news reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .

some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .
30 , which is a clear violation of the rules .
operators in latvia , as well as some operators in estonia and finland , did not reply to the commission 's questionnaire at all . the commission will do a more detailed analysis of the implementation of the eurotariff in october .
the assessment will be the starting point for a decision on whether to extend the offer to include sms , mms and data roaming , as well as whether to intervene in non-cooperative companies . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.08.2007 opinion : financial markets should n't completely dismiss risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout of the us subprime mortgage market has germany 's banks scrambling to ensure the stability of their financial market .
but they should n't be too hesitant about avoiding new risks , says dw 's karl zawadzky . it 's better to be safe than sorry .
but the international financial sector has largely suspended this old piece of popular wisdom in the past years .
gold diggers in hedge funds , investment banks and private equity companies have raked in millions and billions for years with increasingly risky ventures and credit constructions . the banks earned well in the process , too .
they put together credit packages often worth billions for the deals of the alleged financial geniuses , securitizing them and passing the risks on to the capital market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has now become apparent that , once again , greed has deactivated the mind .
everyone only saw the opportunities and faded out the risks .
it could n't go on like this in the long run and has promptly gone sour . every day , the financial sector conveys new evil tidings , especially from the united states .
the subprime mortgage market is falling apart , hedge funds are insolvent , billions of dollars wiped out , investors have lost their money and banks have been forced to close . in germany , the crisis has also reached the first bank .
in principle , it 's a small bank for financing medium-sized businesses .
it was supposed to be a solid thing - and it is . but the management at düsseldorf 's ikb deutsche industriebank could n't resist the temptation of big money .
the bank invested on a grand scale in funds with us subprime mortgages .
it worked for a long time and brought nice profits , which is why a growing wheel continued to be turned . but when the market toppled , the bank was financially overwhelmed .
if ikb had collapsed , it could have sparked a snowball effect with incalculable consequences for the german and international financial markets .
that 's why ikb 's shareholder , the state-owned kfw banking group , is vouching for ikb risks of over 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- .
the major german banks , as well as mutual banks and credit unions have said they will participate in this rescue measure - and not out of the goodness of their hearts , but rather as self-protection . for the time being , one banking crisis has been averted .
but who knows what else is going to swash across the atlantic .
internationally , the risks are being newly evaluated and at a much higher level .
the stock markets are already a good step away from their peak levels reached just a few weeks ago .
but the correction this time is not based on a bubble on the stock exchange , but rather on a credit crisis in the united states that has led to losses at banks around the world . the reassessment of risks as such is not bad , but rather a good thing .
it 's more difficult for financial investors to get inexpensive loans worth billions for their purchases .
risk premiums are being demanded .
that can only be welcomed in the interest of stability for the financial sector . of course , the danger of exaggeration exists here , as well .
if the banks are hesitant not only in awarding large credits to speculators and non-solvent home buyers , but also make perfectly normal business financing more difficult , the crisis in the financial sector could penetrate the real economy .
though it 's better to be safe than sorry , some willingness to take risk should exist in the financial sector . karl zawadzky is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .
germany has offered 200 soldiers to supply logistical support to the au force but has ruled out any direct participation in the peacekeeping force . article based on news reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .
focus on history hagenow said that the finance minister and others had no reason to worry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german emigration center in bremerhaven " what we 've done so far should make it clear that we 're not planning to build an entertainment park , " she said , adding that the german emigration center in bremerhaven , which was designed by her firm , had just won the 2007 european museum of the year award .
" our aim is to convey history in a way that 's scientifically sound and attractive for tourists at the same time , " she said .
town council members of schwangau , where both castles are located , are expected to decide on the proposals in late october . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .
while it 's not clear whether stephan s. , a 43-year-old unemployed truck driver from berlin , was ever aware of this change in the law , he seems to have forgotten that ordering restaurant meals and refusing to pay for them afterwards is still frowned upon .
the 160-kilogram -lrb- 340-pound -rrb- guy should have realized that something was n't quite right when a judge sentenced him to one year in jail on probation for eating too many schnitzels without paying for them .
on thursday , however , he was back in court after stuffing himself at 64 further restaurants , whose owners complained that they were left with some 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,100 -rrb- in unpaid bills as a result .
that 's why the judge ordered him to spend 18 months in prison , prompting stephan s. to complain that he had n't brought his toothbrush along .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 03.08.2007 " terrorists score a major victory if they silence us " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have archaic social ideas , but the taliban are using modern propaganda tools jo groebel , head of the german digital institute in berlin , spoke with dw-world.de about the taliban 's increasing manipulation of the western media to further its own goals . in recent days , the german government has lashed out at the taliban 's " wicked propaganda " and accused the islamist terror group of waging a " media war " against the western world .
the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .

germany 's ard television network , which first broke the story , said 17 journalists were involved . ard said the criminal probe was launched after complaints by the head of the parliamentary investigating committee , siegfried kauder , that classified information was being leaked to the press . the investigating panel " had more holes than a swiss cheese , " kauder told ard .

" i believe that it is part of a journalist 's work to publish such information and they have a duty to inform the public , " he said , adding that it had nothing to do with breaching secrecy laws . stadler also said that parliamentarians should pass legislation to protect journalists in similar situations . focus on intelligence the panel was set up in april 2006 to look into whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz another issue was the handling of the case of a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge . one of the most prominent figures to appear before the panel was foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was coordinator of the intelligence services at the time of the iraq war . steinmeier has come under fire over claims that he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the release of kurnaz . stadler accused panel members belonging to steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- of deliberately leaking information in order to present the minister in a better light . attack on press freedom ? the head of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , called the investigation " a frontal attack on press freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 03.08.2007 eu mobile phone users benefit from lower prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile calling throughout the eu member states has become cheaper the deadline for the implementation of the eurotariff passed , and it has now become a binding law among eu member states .
some companies have still not applied it , while few are offering even lower prices . many mobile companies in the 27 eu nations have put into effect the new maximum fees on cross-border mobile phone calls , meeting the terms of the new " eurotariff , " the european commission said thursday .
the eurotariff requires a charge of no more than 0.49 euro -lrb- $ 0.67 -rrb- per minute for calls made abroad and no higher than 0.29 euro for calls received abroad , throughout the nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone conversations may become even longer with the reduced rates around 50 percent of consumers in europe have already profited from the substantially reduced tariffs , only a month after the new rules came into force , according to viviane reding , eu telecoms commissioner .
many operators offered the tariffs at the start of july , while others began with their new fees just in time for the july 30 deadline .
companies are permitted to compete for their customers by offering prices below the eu cap as well . the operators have a maximum of one month to activate customers ' new tariffs , now that the deadline has come and gone .
if customers do not notify their cell phone operators which fee schedules they wish to pay , the companies are obliged to the switch them automatically to the eurotariff on sept .
30 , ensuring that the users benefits as soon as possible from lower rates .
the eu surveyed 95 mobile operators about when they offered and introduced the eurotariff , as well as its exact price and starting month . britain offers the lowest rate the lowest price currently offered , as identified by the commission , is 31.5 cents a minute for an outgoing call , and 12.6 cents a minute for an incoming call .
this offer comes from britain 's 3 network .
before the price ceilings were applied , an eu traveler could have been charged as much as three euros per minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mobile phone companies have been following the rules of the eurotariff germany 's e-plus and vodafone offer an outgoing call for 49 cents and 24 cents for an incoming call , while o2 and t-mobile offer a slightly lower rate at about 48.5 and 23.5 cents per minute . not all companies have been cooperative , however .
the so-called " black sheep " operators have not followed the new rules for roaming rates , and they will be " analyzed very carefully , " according to reding .
if evidence of violation is found , sanctions might be implemented .
cytamobile in cyprus , for example , will only begin offering the new reduced prices on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 03.08.2007 royal descendants take on tourism at neuschwanstein castle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most neuschwanstein visitors overlook hohenschwangau , which sits to the right bavaria 's neuschwanstein castle is flooded by tourists , but there 's little to do for visitors once they 've checked out the world-famous building .
descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .
focus on history hagenow said that the finance minister and others had no reason to worry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german emigration center in bremerhaven " what we 've done so far should make it clear that we 're not planning to build an entertainment park , " she said , adding that the german emigration center in bremerhaven , which was designed by her firm , had just won the 2007 european museum of the year award .
" our aim is to convey history in a way that 's scientifically sound and attractive for tourists at the same time , " she said .
town council members of schwangau , where both castles are located , are expected to decide on the proposals in late october . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .
germany has offered 200 soldiers to supply logistical support to the au force but has ruled out any direct participation in the peacekeeping force . article based on news reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for some people ordering food in a restaurant and refusing to pay for it might be the ultimate kick .
one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .
while it 's not clear whether stephan s. , a 43-year-old unemployed truck driver from berlin , was ever aware of this change in the law , he seems to have forgotten that ordering restaurant meals and refusing to pay for them afterwards is still frowned upon .
the 160-kilogram -lrb- 340-pound -rrb- guy should have realized that something was n't quite right when a judge sentenced him to one year in jail on probation for eating too many schnitzels without paying for them .
on thursday , however , he was back in court after stuffing himself at 64 further restaurants , whose owners complained that they were left with some 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,100 -rrb- in unpaid bills as a result .
that 's why the judge ordered him to spend 18 months in prison , prompting stephan s. to complain that he had n't brought his toothbrush along .
despite the potential for bad breath , s. might have secretly rejoiced about the verdict - after all he 'll be getting free food for a year and a half without having to worry about angry waiters chasing him .

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .
germany has offered 200 soldiers to supply logistical support to the au force but has ruled out any direct participation in the peacekeeping force . article based on news reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they should n't be too hesitant about avoiding new risks , says dw 's karl zawadzky . it 's better to be safe than sorry .
but the international financial sector has largely suspended this old piece of popular wisdom in the past years .
gold diggers in hedge funds , investment banks and private equity companies have raked in millions and billions for years with increasingly risky ventures and credit constructions . the banks earned well in the process , too .
they put together credit packages often worth billions for the deals of the alleged financial geniuses , securitizing them and passing the risks on to the capital market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has now become apparent that , once again , greed has deactivated the mind .
everyone only saw the opportunities and faded out the risks .
it could n't go on like this in the long run and has promptly gone sour . every day , the financial sector conveys new evil tidings , especially from the united states .
the subprime mortgage market is falling apart , hedge funds are insolvent , billions of dollars wiped out , investors have lost their money and banks have been forced to close . in germany , the crisis has also reached the first bank .
in principle , it 's a small bank for financing medium-sized businesses .
it was supposed to be a solid thing - and it is . but the management at düsseldorf 's ikb deutsche industriebank could n't resist the temptation of big money .
the bank invested on a grand scale in funds with us subprime mortgages .
it worked for a long time and brought nice profits , which is why a growing wheel continued to be turned . but when the market toppled , the bank was financially overwhelmed .
if ikb had collapsed , it could have sparked a snowball effect with incalculable consequences for the german and international financial markets .
that 's why ikb 's shareholder , the state-owned kfw banking group , is vouching for ikb risks of over 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- .
the major german banks , as well as mutual banks and credit unions have said they will participate in this rescue measure - and not out of the goodness of their hearts , but rather as self-protection . for the time being , one banking crisis has been averted .
but who knows what else is going to swash across the atlantic .
internationally , the risks are being newly evaluated and at a much higher level .
the stock markets are already a good step away from their peak levels reached just a few weeks ago .
but the correction this time is not based on a bubble on the stock exchange , but rather on a credit crisis in the united states that has led to losses at banks around the world . the reassessment of risks as such is not bad , but rather a good thing .
it 's more difficult for financial investors to get inexpensive loans worth billions for their purchases .
risk premiums are being demanded .
that can only be welcomed in the interest of stability for the financial sector . of course , the danger of exaggeration exists here , as well .
if the banks are hesitant not only in awarding large credits to speculators and non-solvent home buyers , but also make perfectly normal business financing more difficult , the crisis in the financial sector could penetrate the real economy .
though it 's better to be safe than sorry , some willingness to take risk should exist in the financial sector . karl zawadzky is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gold diggers in hedge funds , investment banks and private equity companies have raked in millions and billions for years with increasingly risky ventures and credit constructions . the banks earned well in the process , too .

the subprime mortgage market is falling apart , hedge funds are insolvent , billions of dollars wiped out , investors have lost their money and banks have been forced to close . in germany , the crisis has also reached the first bank .

if ikb had collapsed , it could have sparked a snowball effect with incalculable consequences for the german and international financial markets .
that 's why ikb 's shareholder , the state-owned kfw banking group , is vouching for ikb risks of over 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- .
the major german banks , as well as mutual banks and credit unions have said they will participate in this rescue measure - and not out of the goodness of their hearts , but rather as self-protection . for the time being , one banking crisis has been averted .

it 's more difficult for financial investors to get inexpensive loans worth billions for their purchases .
risk premiums are being demanded .
that can only be welcomed in the interest of stability for the financial sector . of course , the danger of exaggeration exists here , as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 03.08.2007 " terrorists score a major victory if they silence us " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have archaic social ideas , but the taliban are using modern propaganda tools jo groebel , head of the german digital institute in berlin , spoke with dw-world.de about the taliban 's increasing manipulation of the western media to further its own goals . in recent days , the german government has lashed out at the taliban 's " wicked propaganda " and accused the islamist terror group of waging a " media war " against the western world .
the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .

the condemnation follows inaccurate information by the taliban that it had executed two german hostages in afghanistan . in reality , one of the two kidnapped german construction engineers was shot and killed while the other remains in captivity .
the taliban have demanded germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the hostage . dw-world.de spoke with jo groebel , director of the berlin-based german digital institute and former head of the european media institute , about whether the media needs to be more prudent when reporting on terrorism . the german government has spoken in recent days of the taliban waging a propaganda war .
do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .

do you agree with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier 's office said it was involved in a " media war " with the taliban i totally agree that terrorism , in particular taliban terrorism , is indeed all about the media and propaganda .
i think it 's obvious that the victims of the kidnappings or killings are not primarily the real goal .
the real goal is to create news , to create coverage of these killings and to create panic around the world .
the victims are primarily used for that goal .
modern terrorism is , per definition almost , all about creating fear and panic and , in particular , demonstrating power and control around the world .
and that 's definitely true of the taliban . what do you think the taliban aim to achieve by trying to grab media attention and coverage ? on the one hand the taliban want to stabilize their own infrastructure , their group and community philosophy and thinking .
and at the same they want to perceive themselves and make people believe they are a real threat to the world .
and obviously they 're succeeding in that .
let 's be clear about it , the taliban do n't have global weapons , they do n't have - at least until now - any real chance of being a major threat to the world community .
and yet through the coverage in the media , they create exactly that - namely the impression that they are a global threat even though they are actually a regional threat and do n't have global support . the german government has criticized reporting by some german media in recent days , saying that they have offered a platform for the terrorists .
do you think that criticism is justified ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an abundance of media makes suppressing information impossible , groebel said only to a certain extent .
of course the media needs to report on events as long as that reporting does n't create a new threat .
as soon as terrorists succeed in creating a situation where information and reporting is suppressed , they have achieved some success .
terrorists believe in systems , structures and societies that suppress freedom of expression . to an extent , i can understand the german government when it says the media need to be very careful in its reporting and not end up serving the terrorists .
at the same time , we need to accept that we live in a free society .
there is hardly any way to suppress information , voluntarily or involuntarily , because if it 's not broadcast via official channels then it 's sure to be distributed via blogs or elsewhere on the internet .
so even if one would assume that there is a possibility or even a necessity to not immediately report on terrorist activities , i 'm afraid it would n't work anyway . i have to say too that i think the german reporting so far on the taliban and terrorist activities has been responsible and not prone to exaggeration , sensationalism and creating panic . to talk about a concrete example of how the media should cover terrorism - the bbc 's channel 4 recently aired an interview with the taliban 's military chief , mansur dadullah , in which he called for the mass kidnapping of foreigners in afghanistan .
do you think something like that is acceptable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western media need to evaluate the news they present that can only be answered on a case to case basis .
on the one hand , to have an interview with a real-life taliban leader is a major journalistic scoop .
on the other , you have to ask yourself the question whether such an interview , or indeed offering him a platform , is still primarily fulfilling the need for information .
if the answer is yes in a particular case , then i would say the interview is still justified . but there 's no doubt that there 's always a dilemma in such cases where you have weigh the need to inform the public against the danger of offering a mouthpiece to terrorists .
what is important is to put things in perspective .
that means not just giving a taliban leader a platform to express himself , but also to comment and evaluate what 's going on .
when in doubt , my answer is always : if the reporting does n't directly threaten lives , then freedom of expression has to dominate . the german government says the taliban carefully monitors german debates on afghanistan and instantly reacts to any statements .
should n't then some of the criticism aimed at the media be directed towards politicians who jump at every opportunity to express their views about the security situation in the country or troops ? politics is , much like the media , all about making things public .
thus there is a very strong alliance between politics and politicians on one hand and media on the other because , of course , politicians need the media to express themselves .
unlike what the german government says , it must be said that in comparison to politicians , the media has been reporting on the taliban 's activities in afghanistan in a pretty modest manner . but once again , i have to stress that if the terrorists manage to silence us and stifle expression , then they have already scored a major victory . sonia phalnikar interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the contract is ready to be signed , " a spokeswoman for mbda , the missiles systems subsidiary of eads , said in paris . a second contract worth 128 million euros for communication systems was also close to completion , she said . first arms deal it is the first arms agreement with a european country since the lifting in 2004 of a european embargo on weapons sales to libya , the source added .
french defense minister herve morin confirmed to rtl television channel earlier friday that libya had made a declaration of its intention to buy milan-type missiles and radio systems . a multi-ministerial commission had approved the arms deals in february .
france would be the first country to deliver weapons to libya following the end of an international arms embargo on the north african country . meanwhile , the libyans were not officially confirming the deal that president moammar gaddafi 's son saif had revealed earlier in the week to the french press . " gadhafi 's son does not exercise any official office in this country , which is why what he says is not binding for the state , " arabic newspaper al-sharq al-aswat reported friday , citing a libyan government official . quid pro quo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian nurses returned to their homeland on july 24 saif al-islam gadhafi had told le monde newspaper that a deal had been reached between the french and libyan governments which led to the release last week of six bulgarian medics who had spent eight years in libyan custody - some of it on death row - for deliberately infecting 400 children with hiv . the five nurses and one palestinian-born doctor had been " scapegoats , " saif said , adding that he had never believed they were guilty . experts had also cast doubt on their convictions , saying poor hygiene had led to the infections . a foundation led by saif reached an agreement with bulgaria and the european union in july whereby the families of the infected children would receive compensation , which led to the medics ' ultimate extradition to bulgaria last week where they were pardoned . the government in sofia announced thursday that it would forgive libyan debts of 41 million euros which would be transferred to the international fund for the support of aids-infected children in the libyan port city of benghazi . france rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy visited gadhafi shortly after the bulgarian nurses were released france has been criticized for signing a memorandum since the medics were released to deliver a nuclear power station to libya for civilian use . french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied that there was any connection between the nuclear agreement and the release of the medics . france 's opposition parties have demanded that a commission be set up to look into the arms deals .

one german is now learning the hard way that he 'll better bring money along when he orders his favorite dish next time . long gone are the times when people could get into trouble for " mouth robbery " in germany : until 1975 , stealing negligible amounts of food - say a piece of butter , or a bread roll or maybe a sausage - could lead to a penalty of 500 deutsche marks -lrb- about 250 euros or $ 340 -rrb- and up to six weeks in prison .

both men expressed hope that a meeting of rebel groups and un special envoys starting in tanzania on friday would help to move things forward .
" we share the conviction that a military solution to the security situation in darfur will remain difficult if at the same time the efforts under the auspices of the un to strike a new accord among the various rebel groups are not successful , " steinmeier said . give diplomacy a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria was steinmeier 's first port of call during his three-day african tour osei adjei said diplomacy should be given a chance before countries such as the united states and britain consider imposing sanctions on sudan if it defies the peacekeeping force made up of united nations and african union troops .
a peace deal agreed in may last year failed to halt the fighting in darfur where at least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war and famine and 2.1 million have been forced to flee since the conflict broke out in the western sudanese region in february 2003 .
the meeting in arusha , tanzania , which runs until sunday , will bring together the un envoys and rebel groups that failed to sign up to the accord .
the aim is to set a date and venue for the start of talks between the warring sides .
the ghanaian foreign minister also said he was " optimistic " the united nations-african union force could be deployed in darfur this year and warned against further delays . time to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hybrid force will beef up the current african union peacekeeping contingent " the rains will be coming very soon , and it 's going to be very difficult unless we keep this under control , " said osei adjei .
" otherwise the human calamity will be too much for us . "
the security council voted unanimously tuesday to mandate a 26,000-strong force to take over peacekeeping in darfur from 7,000 badly equipped au troops in a bid to end four years of bloodshed in region .
the german foreign minister welcomed the development upon landing in nigeria , describing the " hybrid " force as proof that african nations were increasingly assuming responsibility for stability on the continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.08.2007 opinion : financial markets should n't completely dismiss risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout of the us subprime mortgage market has germany 's banks scrambling to ensure the stability of their financial market .
but they should n't be too hesitant about avoiding new risks , says dw 's karl zawadzky . it 's better to be safe than sorry .
but the international financial sector has largely suspended this old piece of popular wisdom in the past years .
gold diggers in hedge funds , investment banks and private equity companies have raked in millions and billions for years with increasingly risky ventures and credit constructions . the banks earned well in the process , too .
they put together credit packages often worth billions for the deals of the alleged financial geniuses , securitizing them and passing the risks on to the capital market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has now become apparent that , once again , greed has deactivated the mind .
everyone only saw the opportunities and faded out the risks .
it could n't go on like this in the long run and has promptly gone sour . every day , the financial sector conveys new evil tidings , especially from the united states .
the subprime mortgage market is falling apart , hedge funds are insolvent , billions of dollars wiped out , investors have lost their money and banks have been forced to close . in germany , the crisis has also reached the first bank .
in principle , it 's a small bank for financing medium-sized businesses .
it was supposed to be a solid thing - and it is . but the management at düsseldorf 's ikb deutsche industriebank could n't resist the temptation of big money .
the bank invested on a grand scale in funds with us subprime mortgages .
it worked for a long time and brought nice profits , which is why a growing wheel continued to be turned . but when the market toppled , the bank was financially overwhelmed .
if ikb had collapsed , it could have sparked a snowball effect with incalculable consequences for the german and international financial markets .
that 's why ikb 's shareholder , the state-owned kfw banking group , is vouching for ikb risks of over 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- .
the major german banks , as well as mutual banks and credit unions have said they will participate in this rescue measure - and not out of the goodness of their hearts , but rather as self-protection . for the time being , one banking crisis has been averted .
but who knows what else is going to swash across the atlantic .
internationally , the risks are being newly evaluated and at a much higher level .
the stock markets are already a good step away from their peak levels reached just a few weeks ago .
but the correction this time is not based on a bubble on the stock exchange , but rather on a credit crisis in the united states that has led to losses at banks around the world . the reassessment of risks as such is not bad , but rather a good thing .
it 's more difficult for financial investors to get inexpensive loans worth billions for their purchases .
risk premiums are being demanded .
that can only be welcomed in the interest of stability for the financial sector . of course , the danger of exaggeration exists here , as well .
if the banks are hesitant not only in awarding large credits to speculators and non-solvent home buyers , but also make perfectly normal business financing more difficult , the crisis in the financial sector could penetrate the real economy .
though it 's better to be safe than sorry , some willingness to take risk should exist in the financial sector . karl zawadzky is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .

descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that . neuschwanstein is n't exactly tourist-friendly .
it takes a good 90-minute car ride from munich and a strenuous hike up a steep hill to reach the fairy-tale castle of bavaria 's " mad " king ludwig ii that rises majestically in front of the alps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenschwangau was ludwig 's childhood home nevertheless , some 1.3 million annual visitors flock to the relatively young palace , which had not been completed by the time of ludwig 's death in 1886 .
a far smaller number of people , however , seem interested in nearby hohenschwangau castle , where the king spent part of his childhood .
" most people visit neuschwanstein and leave again , " said hanspeter beisser , the legal counsel for the waf fund that was established to compensate bavaria 's wittelsbach dynasty after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918 .
broadening the spectrum while the bavarian state owns neuschwanstein , hohenschwangau is still waf property and ludwig 's descendants are now looking for ways to get more people to add a second stop on their trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum could help tourists find out more about ludwig and his family " tourists need a broad spectrum of attractions on offer , " beisser said , adding that a traffic congestion problem in the area sparked waf officials to think of ways to spread out the crowds .
" every day we see visitors who are struggling to get through traffic , " he said .
" they want to see neuschwanstein and spend a nice day there , but the ' nice day ' part does n't always work out . "
connecting the dots that 's why the waf , which also owns a hotel in the area , has proposed establishing a museum on the wittelsbach family history at hohenschwangau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists usually leave as soon as they taken in neuschwanstein " neuschwanstein would n't be possible without hohenschwangau , " said elisabeth von hagenow , an art historian with the hamburg architectural firm studio andreas heller that waf officials hired to come up with a new tourism concept for the region .
" a wittelsbach museum would connect the two points . "
other ideas that are up for discussion include construction of an arena for events and concerts as well as a panoramic train that would transport people up the hill to the castles .
pleasing unesco the train in particular has n't been well received by local critics and bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser , who oversees state-owned palaces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden could still lose its unesco world heritage site status " bavaria will categorically reject any proposals that endanger plans to turn the royal palaces into unesco world heritage sites , " faltlhauser said in a statement on thursday , adding that the state had learned its lesson from dresden , which could still lose the unesco seal because of plans to build a modern bridge across the city 's elbe river .
but faltlhauser also said that he did welcome any other improvements for tourists in the area as long as they did not infringe on neuschwanstein 's integrity .
focus on history hagenow said that the finance minister and others had no reason to worry .

kafeel ahmed was the second man detained during the glasgow airport incident in which a burning jeep crashed into the terminal building .
it 's believed the 27-year-old had left bangalore , india , to make a new life in the west .
however , he became a terror suspect , reportedly transformed into a ruthless activist intent on bringing death and mayhem to scotland - a country which traditionally thought it was immune to terrorism .
during the attack on 30 june , ahmed was said to have emerged from the jeep covered in flames .
he fought desperately with police and passers-by who tried to pull him away from the scene .
soon after events at the airport , it emerged that ahmed was an engineer with a phd in design and technology .
the young man 's world was a patchwork of rumour and speculation , although it appears that his life in the uk started inconspicuously enough .
it is thought that ahmed was one of scores of indian students who entered queen 's university , belfast , in 2001 and remained in northern ireland until 2004 .
severe burns he studied for his phd in the department of design and technology at anglia polytechnic university -lrb- now called anglia ruskin university -rrb- in cambridge .
during the airport attack , he suffered burns to 90 % of his body and was not expected to survive for long .
reports have emerged that ahmed was part of a cell which may also have planned attacks in australia and the us .
he and his brother sabeel , who was also arrested , had applied to work in australia but were turned down .
according to some reports , just before the glasgow attack , ahmed is said to have spoken to his mother and sister with the message : " i will go to that place , finish that work and go to london and will return to bangalore from there .
all this may take a month 's time . "
despite the hazy details of his life , one thing remains indisputable .
ahmed 's death after weeks in intensive care , robs the police and security services of a potential witness to a chain of terror which stretches around the world .

while men 's drinking peaked in their late 20s , women 's alcohol intake reached its heights among the over-40s .
in a year , 893 people were breathalysed late at night in the city centre for the cardiff university study .
it found 40 % of men and 20 % of women had drunk over a level which put them more at risk of injury and ill-health .
researchers said their findings came as " something of a surprise " .
binge-drinking is defined as eight units for men and six units for women , which is twice the daily recommended alcohol intake .
what was more surprising was that students , unemployed people , young adults , had lower alcohol levels than older people and employed people prof jonathan shepherd professor jonathan shepherd said the survey , funded by the alcohol and education research council , had shown a " clear difference " between men and women 's drinking patterns .
in men , blood alcohol concentration was highest in 29-year-olds , but then tended to decrease with the age of those surveyed .
but in women , the levels continued to rise with the age of respondents , with levels peaking in the over-40 age group .
prof shepherd said : " it 's hard to explain and raises a whole lot of other questions .
" we speculate younger women have more responsibilities at home , and once the children have left home , then the sky 's the limit .
" but to be honest , we do n't really know why . "
he said underage drinking in the city centre late at night " was n't really an issue " .
" what was more surprising was that students , unemployed people , young adults , had lower alcohol levels than older people and employed people . "
the findings of the survey included : men drank for longer than women , an average of a seven-hour session for men and five-and-three-quarter hours for women older women were more drunk than younger women men in their late 20s were more drunk than older and younger men younger drinkers , students and the unemployed are not the most " at risk " groups for heavy drinking .
drink consumption affected people 's ability to recall how much they had drunk - " a key policy objective should be to keep intoxication levels below the point at which drinkers cease to be aware of consumption " .
prof shepherd said the findings supported the idea that the way to control heavy drinking was to put up alcohol prices .
" the reasons students and the unemployed did n't feature much , or have higher alcohol levels was because they could n't afford it , " he said .
bar staff " our research also found that after a certain point , people lose track of the amount they have consumed and therefore need other people , such as police , bar staff or friends to prevent them drinking more . "
a team took to the streets of cardiff on one friday night and one saturday night a month for 12 months , and drinkers were asked to take a breath test .
dubbed the lion 's breath project , the initial findings were released in april 2006 .
speaking as the final conclusions were published , prof shepherd said the findings had revealed a better picture of binge drinking in the capital than expected .
he said : " there 's good reason to think that other places are worse , and that cardiff is doing well in this regard , but we could obviously do better . "
the research team was headed by prof shepherd and dr simon moore of the university 's violence & society research group .

it had threatened to halve supplies to the former soviet republic if the debt was not paid by friday , but has now given belarus until 10 august to pay .
belarus has made a first payment of $ 190m -lrb- £ 93m -rrb- , which is 42 % of the $ 456m gazprom says it owes .
a delegation from belarus has been in moscow trying to reach a settlement with gazprom .
the incident is a reminder of the supply disputes with ex-soviet republics seen in 2005 and 2006 .
price rises belarus had previously said it needed more time to pay , blaming gazprom 's doubling of the price it charged for the gas earlier in the year .
under a deal agreed at the start of year , russia increased the price per 1,000 cubic metres of gas from $ 46 to $ 100 .
the price for the first half of 2007 was set at $ 55 , but belarus was required to pay debts of $ 456m to gazprom by 23 july .
moscow denies accusations that it uses gas supplies to bully its neighbours .
instead , it insists that price rises last year for belarus , ukraine and georgia merely reflect the end of soviet-era subsidies .

the incident is a reminder of the supply disputes with ex-soviet republics seen in 2005 and 2006 .
price rises belarus had previously said it needed more time to pay , blaming gazprom 's doubling of the price it charged for the gas earlier in the year .
under a deal agreed at the start of year , russia increased the price per 1,000 cubic metres of gas from $ 46 to $ 100 .
the price for the first half of 2007 was set at $ 55 , but belarus was required to pay debts of $ 456m to gazprom by 23 july .
moscow denies accusations that it uses gas supplies to bully its neighbours .

jumpcut the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
if you do not own any video editing software jumpcut is an online resource that allows you to perform simple edits , add titles , create photo slide shows and upload video to the jumpcut site .
the site is owned by yahoo so you will need to create a yahoo account then register with jumpcut .
once registration is complete , select the upload option and browse the video or stills saved on your hard drive .
select the images you want to edit , then hit upload .
this then opens the web-based editor .
the software automatically turns these files into a movie .
on the right of the screen you will find the option to edit , clicking on this takes you to the online editor .
you can also upload several clips from different sources to cut together .
the site includes a step-by-step video guide to editing , and there are text guides for the more complicated features , like using effects such as fades and dissolves .
to get a feel for what is possible with jumpcut , click on the explore tab on the left of the screen .
here you will be able to search examples of other users ' movies and perhaps get a bit of inspiration .
there is also a public clips library , here you can grab and splice these clips into your own magnum opus .
once your edit is complete it can be published on the public section of the jumpcut site , or if you are feeling shy you can keep your work private and for your eyes only .
the site design is really clear and concise , and while it might take a while to get to grips with the arcane art of video editing , you will have a lot of fun experimenting .
chasing the frog the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
unusually named site , chasing the frog , is a great resource for quirky off-the-wall or little known facts about some of the biggest movies .
a visit to the homepage reveals the site is broken down into sections revealing different facts about hollywood 's greatest hits .
clicking on the true stories section examines films based on historical facts .
there are articles and interviews discussing the movies which include mini bios of the actors involved .
clicking on reel faces compares the movie 's cast to their real life counterparts .
take donnie brasco for instance , the hollywood hoods led by johnny depp are slightly more glamorous than the real world gangsters .
head over to the classics section to vote for your favourite mob and vampire movies or to check out the original trailers to hollywood classics .
for further discussion and to swap obscure film facts take a trip over to the lively forum .
and for a little bit of fun click on the unmasked section and check out the faces and voices behind a couple of the movies ' scariest villains .
movie news and latest box office returns round out the package .
this is a fun little site that offers an interesting spin on movie websites .
photobooth.net the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
this is a weird little blog dedicated to the humble photo booth .
while you may think there would be very little to say about these photographic relics , this blog surprises with its breadth of knowledge and humour .
the site is only concerned with so-called proper photo booths .
you will not find any digital examples on here .
as this site is based in the us , the photo booth locator has an american bias , but this section of the site lists notable photo booths around the world .
site visitors can contribute an exterior image of a photo booth as well as a copy of a picture they have taken inside the booth .
these are accompanied by a short bit of text describing the booths location and any information the contributors have managed to glean about its manufacture .
all very silly but great fun .
the art section of the sites discusses artists who have used the photo booth as means of realising their creative vision , including articles on the likes of andy warhol .
the photo booth in the movies tab leads to a nice part of the blog which lists where photo booths have played pivotal roles in feature films , and includes a quick summary of the movie and stills of the film in question , and yes , superman 3 does get a look in .
selecting projects reveals a wealth of information about creative techniques that can be applied to snaps taken in photo booths , little tricks that make the images more interesting .
this is wonderfully pointless site , but the enthusiasm which has gone into its construction makes it a fun way to while away some spare time .

jumpcut the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
if you do not own any video editing software jumpcut is an online resource that allows you to perform simple edits , add titles , create photo slide shows and upload video to the jumpcut site .
the site is owned by yahoo so you will need to create a yahoo account then register with jumpcut .
once registration is complete , select the upload option and browse the video or stills saved on your hard drive .
select the images you want to edit , then hit upload .
this then opens the web-based editor .
the software automatically turns these files into a movie .
on the right of the screen you will find the option to edit , clicking on this takes you to the online editor .
you can also upload several clips from different sources to cut together .
the site includes a step-by-step video guide to editing , and there are text guides for the more complicated features , like using effects such as fades and dissolves .
to get a feel for what is possible with jumpcut , click on the explore tab on the left of the screen .
here you will be able to search examples of other users ' movies and perhaps get a bit of inspiration .
there is also a public clips library , here you can grab and splice these clips into your own magnum opus .
once your edit is complete it can be published on the public section of the jumpcut site , or if you are feeling shy you can keep your work private and for your eyes only .
the site design is really clear and concise , and while it might take a while to get to grips with the arcane art of video editing , you will have a lot of fun experimenting .
chasing the frog the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
unusually named site , chasing the frog , is a great resource for quirky off-the-wall or little known facts about some of the biggest movies .
a visit to the homepage reveals the site is broken down into sections revealing different facts about hollywood 's greatest hits .
clicking on the true stories section examines films based on historical facts .
there are articles and interviews discussing the movies which include mini bios of the actors involved .
clicking on reel faces compares the movie 's cast to their real life counterparts .
take donnie brasco for instance , the hollywood hoods led by johnny depp are slightly more glamorous than the real world gangsters .
head over to the classics section to vote for your favourite mob and vampire movies or to check out the original trailers to hollywood classics .
for further discussion and to swap obscure film facts take a trip over to the lively forum .
and for a little bit of fun click on the unmasked section and check out the faces and voices behind a couple of the movies ' scariest villains .
movie news and latest box office returns round out the package .
this is a fun little site that offers an interesting spin on movie websites .
photobooth.net the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
this is a weird little blog dedicated to the humble photo booth .
while you may think there would be very little to say about these photographic relics , this blog surprises with its breadth of knowledge and humour .
the site is only concerned with so-called proper photo booths .
you will not find any digital examples on here .
as this site is based in the us , the photo booth locator has an american bias , but this section of the site lists notable photo booths around the world .
site visitors can contribute an exterior image of a photo booth as well as a copy of a picture they have taken inside the booth .
these are accompanied by a short bit of text describing the booths location and any information the contributors have managed to glean about its manufacture .
all very silly but great fun .
the art section of the sites discusses artists who have used the photo booth as means of realising their creative vision , including articles on the likes of andy warhol .
the photo booth in the movies tab leads to a nice part of the blog which lists where photo booths have played pivotal roles in feature films , and includes a quick summary of the movie and stills of the film in question , and yes , superman 3 does get a look in .
selecting projects reveals a wealth of information about creative techniques that can be applied to snaps taken in photo booths , little tricks that make the images more interesting .
this is wonderfully pointless site , but the enthusiasm which has gone into its construction makes it a fun way to while away some spare time .

last updated : friday , 3 august 2007 , 07:36 gmt 08:36 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version webscape by kate russell click webscape-r kate russell gives us her latest selection of the best sites on the world wide web .
jumpcut the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
if you do not own any video editing software jumpcut is an online resource that allows you to perform simple edits , add titles , create photo slide shows and upload video to the jumpcut site .
the site is owned by yahoo so you will need to create a yahoo account then register with jumpcut .
once registration is complete , select the upload option and browse the video or stills saved on your hard drive .
select the images you want to edit , then hit upload .
this then opens the web-based editor .
the software automatically turns these files into a movie .
on the right of the screen you will find the option to edit , clicking on this takes you to the online editor .
you can also upload several clips from different sources to cut together .
the site includes a step-by-step video guide to editing , and there are text guides for the more complicated features , like using effects such as fades and dissolves .
to get a feel for what is possible with jumpcut , click on the explore tab on the left of the screen .
here you will be able to search examples of other users ' movies and perhaps get a bit of inspiration .
there is also a public clips library , here you can grab and splice these clips into your own magnum opus .
once your edit is complete it can be published on the public section of the jumpcut site , or if you are feeling shy you can keep your work private and for your eyes only .
the site design is really clear and concise , and while it might take a while to get to grips with the arcane art of video editing , you will have a lot of fun experimenting .
chasing the frog the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
unusually named site , chasing the frog , is a great resource for quirky off-the-wall or little known facts about some of the biggest movies .
a visit to the homepage reveals the site is broken down into sections revealing different facts about hollywood 's greatest hits .
clicking on the true stories section examines films based on historical facts .
there are articles and interviews discussing the movies which include mini bios of the actors involved .
clicking on reel faces compares the movie 's cast to their real life counterparts .
take donnie brasco for instance , the hollywood hoods led by johnny depp are slightly more glamorous than the real world gangsters .
head over to the classics section to vote for your favourite mob and vampire movies or to check out the original trailers to hollywood classics .
for further discussion and to swap obscure film facts take a trip over to the lively forum .
and for a little bit of fun click on the unmasked section and check out the faces and voices behind a couple of the movies ' scariest villains .
movie news and latest box office returns round out the package .
this is a fun little site that offers an interesting spin on movie websites .
photobooth.net the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
this is a weird little blog dedicated to the humble photo booth .
while you may think there would be very little to say about these photographic relics , this blog surprises with its breadth of knowledge and humour .
the site is only concerned with so-called proper photo booths .
you will not find any digital examples on here .
as this site is based in the us , the photo booth locator has an american bias , but this section of the site lists notable photo booths around the world .
site visitors can contribute an exterior image of a photo booth as well as a copy of a picture they have taken inside the booth .
these are accompanied by a short bit of text describing the booths location and any information the contributors have managed to glean about its manufacture .
all very silly but great fun .
the art section of the sites discusses artists who have used the photo booth as means of realising their creative vision , including articles on the likes of andy warhol .
the photo booth in the movies tab leads to a nice part of the blog which lists where photo booths have played pivotal roles in feature films , and includes a quick summary of the movie and stills of the film in question , and yes , superman 3 does get a look in .
selecting projects reveals a wealth of information about creative techniques that can be applied to snaps taken in photo booths , little tricks that make the images more interesting .
this is wonderfully pointless site , but the enthusiasm which has gone into its construction makes it a fun way to while away some spare time .
