20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table . " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile said the eu should not bank on nuclear power . " if they put excessive emphasis on atomic energy in their energy policy , then we 'll have a debate with the commission , " gabriel told germany 's ard public television on wednesday . eu leaders will decide the commission 's plans will be submitted to eu heads of state and government at a march summit with a view to forge a broad-ranging common energy policy . until now energy policy has been largely conducted along national lines , but recent oil price jumps and disruptions of russian gas supplies last year have focused leaders ' minds on an ambitious joint eu approach . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu study warns of catastrophe if global warming not curbed an eu study on climate change to be released wednesday has warned of drought-like conditions , catastrophic damage to business and tens of thousands of dead if urgent steps are n't taken to check global warming .

" he believes i am pro-nazi , " chapmann told reed .
" i believe dr. graumann will keep his promise .
then i will assassinate hitler ... with my knowledge of explosives and incendiary material , it should be possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during a speech in may 1937 in germany however , reed pointed out that any attempt to kill hitler would be suicidal . " whether or not you succeeded , you would be liquidated immediately , " reed said . " ah , but what a way out ! "
chapman replied . no " wild enterprises " in a report back to his superiors , reed reportedly advised against following up on chapman 's idea . " he -lrb- chapman -rrb- can think of no better way of leaving this life than to have his name prominently featured throughout the world 's press and to be immortalized in history books for all time . "
reed also believed that chapman was motivated by patriotism as well as a desire to make amends for his criminal past . macintyre said that winston churchill , britain 's wartime prime minister , would have been made aware of the offer .
but chapman was explicitly told " not to undertake any wild enterprises " by his british spymaster , colonel tommy robertson . new evidence suggests that chapman 's german spymaster was a bitter opponent of hitler who may have been aware of the plan and given it his backing , macintyre wrote . chapman , a professional criminal and safe-cracker , was reportedly serving a sentence in jersey prison when the nazis invaded the channel islands in june 1940 . he was recruited by german military intelligence and parachuted back into britain in december 1941 .
he immediately defected to m15 . chapman died in 1997 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?

" economic growth will not help us if our environment is at risk but we need to achieve these objectives in a way which does not impinge on our competitiveness , " glos said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she 's in favor of extending the use of nuclear power merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are also at odds on nuclear power .
while the spd remains committed to a phase-out that will see all nuclear plants shut down by 2020 , the cdu is in favor of extending their life spans . merkel on wednesday reaffirmed that she was personally in favor of extending the use of nuclear power . " we get one third of our electricity from nuclear energy and if we want to phase out nuclear by 2020 then we either need to replace these sources or find energy savings , " merkel said .
" those that say we do n't want nuclear energy need to play a role in coming up with the answers . " energy heavyweights not happy the eu commission 's energy strategy was also greeted with skepticism by key players in germany 's energy sector . the gas industry federation bgw was angered by brussels ' proposals to compel big energy companies to unbundle their supply and generation businesses from their network operations . the commission was " fundamentally questioning the companies ' rights to ownership of their networks , " bgw said in a statement . bgw president michael feist warned that there was a danger , if companies felt their networks would be expropriated by the state , that companies would not invest in those networks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german gas companies are n't happy with some of the provisions in the eu plan " that will lead to a deterioration of the quality of supply , " feist argued . german economy minister glos was also critical of the eu measure . " the commission is now talking about unbundling ownership and we need to verify first whether this is compatible with the constitution , " glos said , adding that germany would not " take any hasty steps . " stronger push for renewables needed for others , some of the eu measures did n't go far enough . " the eu commission has n't the courage to lay down binding and clearly defined regulations , " the head of bee federation for renewable energy sources , milan nitzschke , said in a statement . " we 're currently seeing just how fatal the eu 's dependence is on energy supplies from russia .
if once again , no clear strategy is drawn up to expand renewable sources of energy , that will spotlight the shortcomings of european energy policy , " nitzschke said . the bee urged the government to push for an ambitious goal of making renewable energy sources account for 25 percent of all energy production by 2020 , instead of the 20 percent targeted by brussels . " only in this way can the eu 's greenhouse gas emissions and the bloc 's dramatic dependence on oil and gas imports be reduced , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power in germany : a chronology half a century has passed since germany began exploring nuclear energy .

what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .
let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .
one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .

hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .

" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .

distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 eu unveils major new energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu energy strategy will be debated on feb .
20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table . " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile said the eu should not bank on nuclear power . " if they put excessive emphasis on atomic energy in their energy policy , then we 'll have a debate with the commission , " gabriel told germany 's ard public television on wednesday . eu leaders will decide the commission 's plans will be submitted to eu heads of state and government at a march summit with a view to forge a broad-ranging common energy policy . until now energy policy has been largely conducted along national lines , but recent oil price jumps and disruptions of russian gas supplies last year have focused leaders ' minds on an ambitious joint eu approach . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu study warns of catastrophe if global warming not curbed an eu study on climate change to be released wednesday has warned of drought-like conditions , catastrophic damage to business and tens of thousands of dead if urgent steps are n't taken to check global warming .

" he believes i am pro-nazi , " chapmann told reed .
" i believe dr. graumann will keep his promise .
then i will assassinate hitler ... with my knowledge of explosives and incendiary material , it should be possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during a speech in may 1937 in germany however , reed pointed out that any attempt to kill hitler would be suicidal . " whether or not you succeeded , you would be liquidated immediately , " reed said . " ah , but what a way out ! "
chapman replied . no " wild enterprises " in a report back to his superiors , reed reportedly advised against following up on chapman 's idea . " he -lrb- chapman -rrb- can think of no better way of leaving this life than to have his name prominently featured throughout the world 's press and to be immortalized in history books for all time . "
reed also believed that chapman was motivated by patriotism as well as a desire to make amends for his criminal past . macintyre said that winston churchill , britain 's wartime prime minister , would have been made aware of the offer .
but chapman was explicitly told " not to undertake any wild enterprises " by his british spymaster , colonel tommy robertson . new evidence suggests that chapman 's german spymaster was a bitter opponent of hitler who may have been aware of the plan and given it his backing , macintyre wrote . chapman , a professional criminal and safe-cracker , was reportedly serving a sentence in jersey prison when the nazis invaded the channel islands in june 1940 . he was recruited by german military intelligence and parachuted back into britain in december 1941 .
he immediately defected to m15 . chapman died in 1997 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?

20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table . " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile said the eu should not bank on nuclear power . " if they put excessive emphasis on atomic energy in their energy policy , then we 'll have a debate with the commission , " gabriel told germany 's ard public television on wednesday . eu leaders will decide the commission 's plans will be submitted to eu heads of state and government at a march summit with a view to forge a broad-ranging common energy policy . until now energy policy has been largely conducted along national lines , but recent oil price jumps and disruptions of russian gas supplies last year have focused leaders ' minds on an ambitious joint eu approach . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu study warns of catastrophe if global warming not curbed an eu study on climate change to be released wednesday has warned of drought-like conditions , catastrophic damage to business and tens of thousands of dead if urgent steps are n't taken to check global warming .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .

he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .

finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 10.01.2007 dw-world.de picks bundesliga dream team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with ten goals this season , miroslav klose is one of the league 's big winners our dream team may surprise some people .
no one from bayern made the starting squad , and it contains a few unfamiliar names as well as a fabulous foursome who have led bremen to the very top . the strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's marko pantelic has silenced all the critics any list of the bundesliga 's best has to start with bremen 's miroslav klose .
he stumbled a bit after a tough world cup campaign , but the winter break sees him sharing the honors as the season 's top goal-getter .
the only bad news : klose is so good he 'll likely leave the bundesliga for one of europe 's biggest clubs when his contract expires this summer . like klose , hertha berlin 's marko pantelic is on 10 goals - but he 's done it without bremen 's well-oiled offensive machine setting him up .
once known as a petulant prima donna , the serbian striker has been relentlessly positive this season , leading a rebuilding hertha squad to a respectable fifth in the table . on the bench : mario gomez -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , roy makaay -lrb- bayern -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- aachen -rrb- the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's zvjezdan misimovic has been deadly with free kicks here , too , we start with bremen .
the big question for werder this season was whether diego could replace johan micoud as playmaker .
eight goals and 10 assists later , that issue has been laid to rest .
the lightning-quick brazilian has shredded opposing defenses , finding open teammates and , when necessary , the back of the net . zvjezdan misimovic does n't get the press diego does , but bochum 's bosnian playmaker is arguably more important to his team .
his five goals and seven assists have helped an anything-but-stellar squad escape the relegation zone .
bayern munich may be regretting letting him go in 2004 . jawhar mnari is one of the main reasons why nuremberg are sitting comfortably in the standings .
the tunesian national has been rock solid in defensive midfield and provides the crucial link between the back four and the attack .
he 's also one of the league 's best penalty takers , having converted two for two from the spot . and as a stopper , bremen 's torsten frings takes the honors .
he came into his own during the world cup , and he 's played every single bundesliga minute for werder this season .
it 's no accident that bremen 's worst defeat this season - to an amateur club in the german cup - came when the german midfielder was out with injury . on the bench : pavel pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- bayern -rrb- , laurentiu reghecampf -lrb- aachen -rrb- , albert streit -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- the defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder 's naldo is both a heady defender and a goal-getter occupying the right-hand side of the back line is stuttgart 's serdar tasci .
though only 19 years of age , he 's established himself as a regular starter for this season 's surprise overachievers .
he 's scored a pair of goals , but what 's perhaps even more impressive is that he 's only picked up a lone yellow card in 15 appearances . in the middle , there 's no getting around bremen 's naldo .
the huge brazilian is werder 's most improved player and he 's also the league 's highest scoring defender .
six goals this season , including a hattrick against frankfurt in december , have shown that he 's a force to be reckoned with at both ends of the field . alongside naldo is another giant , wolfsburg 's alexander madlung .
the young german anchors the league 's stingiest defense and he 's learned to play with discipline , having yet to be booked this season .
what 's more , with two goals to his name , he 's responsible for one-sixth of the wolves ' otherwise anemic offense . on the left-hand side , we have schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
although more of a midfielder , the georgian international has played at the back for most of the season , and he 's acquitted himself well , scoring three goals .
more importantly , his no-nonsense play helped schalke settle down after some early-season turmoil and finish 2006 level on points with bremen . on the bench : per mertesacker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kevin hofland -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , matthieu delpierre -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelo bordon -lrb- schalke -rrb- the goalkee per bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is one of the few balls to get past dortmund 's roman weidenfeller finally , it 's hard to choose among the array of excellent goalkeepers in the bundesliga , but our nod goes to dortmund 's roman weidenfeller .
he 's one of the few keepers this year to have shut down bremen 's attack , and many people think he should get a chance in the german national squad .
he also has n't missed a minute between the posts . on the bench : markus pröll -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- , simon jentzsch -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , mathias hain -lrb- bielefeld -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer click here for dw-world.de 's complete soccer coverage .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .

working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

no one from bayern made the starting squad , and it contains a few unfamiliar names as well as a fabulous foursome who have led bremen to the very top . the strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's marko pantelic has silenced all the critics any list of the bundesliga 's best has to start with bremen 's miroslav klose .
he stumbled a bit after a tough world cup campaign , but the winter break sees him sharing the honors as the season 's top goal-getter .
the only bad news : klose is so good he 'll likely leave the bundesliga for one of europe 's biggest clubs when his contract expires this summer . like klose , hertha berlin 's marko pantelic is on 10 goals - but he 's done it without bremen 's well-oiled offensive machine setting him up .
once known as a petulant prima donna , the serbian striker has been relentlessly positive this season , leading a rebuilding hertha squad to a respectable fifth in the table . on the bench : mario gomez -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , roy makaay -lrb- bayern -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- aachen -rrb- the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's zvjezdan misimovic has been deadly with free kicks here , too , we start with bremen .
the big question for werder this season was whether diego could replace johan micoud as playmaker .
eight goals and 10 assists later , that issue has been laid to rest .
the lightning-quick brazilian has shredded opposing defenses , finding open teammates and , when necessary , the back of the net . zvjezdan misimovic does n't get the press diego does , but bochum 's bosnian playmaker is arguably more important to his team .
his five goals and seven assists have helped an anything-but-stellar squad escape the relegation zone .
bayern munich may be regretting letting him go in 2004 . jawhar mnari is one of the main reasons why nuremberg are sitting comfortably in the standings .
the tunesian national has been rock solid in defensive midfield and provides the crucial link between the back four and the attack .
he 's also one of the league 's best penalty takers , having converted two for two from the spot . and as a stopper , bremen 's torsten frings takes the honors .
he came into his own during the world cup , and he 's played every single bundesliga minute for werder this season .
it 's no accident that bremen 's worst defeat this season - to an amateur club in the german cup - came when the german midfielder was out with injury . on the bench : pavel pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- bayern -rrb- , laurentiu reghecampf -lrb- aachen -rrb- , albert streit -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- the defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder 's naldo is both a heady defender and a goal-getter occupying the right-hand side of the back line is stuttgart 's serdar tasci .
though only 19 years of age , he 's established himself as a regular starter for this season 's surprise overachievers .
he 's scored a pair of goals , but what 's perhaps even more impressive is that he 's only picked up a lone yellow card in 15 appearances . in the middle , there 's no getting around bremen 's naldo .
the huge brazilian is werder 's most improved player and he 's also the league 's highest scoring defender .
six goals this season , including a hattrick against frankfurt in december , have shown that he 's a force to be reckoned with at both ends of the field . alongside naldo is another giant , wolfsburg 's alexander madlung .

although more of a midfielder , the georgian international has played at the back for most of the season , and he 's acquitted himself well , scoring three goals .
more importantly , his no-nonsense play helped schalke settle down after some early-season turmoil and finish 2006 level on points with bremen . on the bench : per mertesacker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kevin hofland -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , matthieu delpierre -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelo bordon -lrb- schalke -rrb- the goalkee per bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is one of the few balls to get past dortmund 's roman weidenfeller finally , it 's hard to choose among the array of excellent goalkeepers in the bundesliga , but our nod goes to dortmund 's roman weidenfeller .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes . " we 've been able to increase the pressure on pedophiles in recent years , but the deeper we look the bigger the magnitude of this crime appears to get , " he said . in germany , the depiction of sexual acts by anyone under the age of 14 is considered child pornography .
in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .
but , he added , a huge number remain undetected , as child pornography is a rapidly growing market in the internet era . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 reader response : " europe needs energy independence " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative energy does n't help much if we 're still using lots of it , said one reader oil supplies from russia to europe were disrupted this week , and the eu unfurled a revamped energy policy .
dw readers wrote in with their thoughts and suggestions on europe 's energy woes . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .
let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .
one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .
today , russia is too big and important of an energy supplier to countries such as germany .
even if germany invested further in nuclear power plants , solar and wind energy and further , russian energy will remain too important to the entire eu community . - atilla a. iftikhar compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power in germany : a chronology half a century has passed since germany began exploring nuclear energy .

some 100 million sun-seekers from northern europe travel each year to the beaches of spain , greece , portugal and italy , making southern europe one of the world 's most popular destinations . but if climate change did proceed unchecked then the tourist destinations would shift to the north sea , destroying the economic backbone of the mediterranean region , the study warns . surplus harvest in north , drought in the south the report also forecast dire consequences for the european economy if the gap between the north and the south were to dramatically increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather patterns are changing the report points out if northern europe experiences longer periods during which temperatures stay above the freezing point , harvest yields could jump by 70 percent .
at the same time , harvest yields in southern europe could decline by as much as 50 percent .
the study says global co2 emissions should be immediately cut by 15 percent and should be lowered by almost 50 percent by 2050 . the report is part of a broad review of the eu 's energy policies .
the european commission will also propose wednesday , during the unveiling of its energy policy , that the eu commit to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , an eu source said tuesday . dramatic climate change in germany confirming some of the eu study 's results on tuesday , the german agency for maritime affairs and hydrography -lrb- bsh -rrb- said that global warming effects on in the north sea and baltic sea could no longer be prevented , but on mitigated by lowering carbon dioxide emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 eu unveils major new energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu energy strategy will be debated on feb .
20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table . " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile said the eu should not bank on nuclear power . " if they put excessive emphasis on atomic energy in their energy policy , then we 'll have a debate with the commission , " gabriel told germany 's ard public television on wednesday . eu leaders will decide the commission 's plans will be submitted to eu heads of state and government at a march summit with a view to forge a broad-ranging common energy policy . until now energy policy has been largely conducted along national lines , but recent oil price jumps and disruptions of russian gas supplies last year have focused leaders ' minds on an ambitious joint eu approach . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu study warns of catastrophe if global warming not curbed an eu study on climate change to be released wednesday has warned of drought-like conditions , catastrophic damage to business and tens of thousands of dead if urgent steps are n't taken to check global warming .

" a solution has been found , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in an interview published wednesday .
" the participants have reached an agreement .
the final details are now being worked out . " a deal was scheduled to be announced next week or the week after next , wilhelm added . a consortium of banks is set to take over a 7.5 percent share in eads , but plans to hold it only for a few years , before reselling it to daimlerchrysler , the reuters news agency reported , citing an anonymous source familiar with the deal .
daimlerchrysler would retain its voting rights . " it is an interim solution , it 's no more than a loan , " the source said , adding that it would n't be unrealistic to hold the stake for three or four years . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported that the deal would be based on a complex construction of derivative securities that would run for a number of years .
observers value the share at 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.95 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to be on an even keel with france media reports have said the consortium would include deutsche bank , commerzbank , kfw kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau , a number of regional public-sector banks , or landesbanken , and three non-german financial institutes : goldman sachs , morgan stanley and credit suisse .
germany wants to keep a balance germany is currently represented in the european aeronautics defense and space company via a 22.5 percent share held by german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler .
french interests are controlled by the holding company sogeade , which holds 15 percent and is controlled by the french state .
a further 15 percent share is owned by the media and defense group lagardere , which also plans to sell 7.5 percent , reducing the french stake of 22.5 percent . but daimlerchrysler has made it known that it wants to reduce its stake to 15 percent , raising the question of what would happen to the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale . berlin insists the stake should remain in german hands in order to maintain the current balance of power . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boeing overtakes airbus in new orders for 2006 us airplane maker boeing has overtaken europe 's floundering airbus consortium , ending five years of runner-up status .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .
let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .
one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.01.2007 japan 's abe , merkel discuss north korea in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abe and merkel in berlin on wednesday japanese premier shinzo abe on wednesday met with his german counterpart in berlin to explain his country 's current drive to redefine its foreign policy guidelines and increase economic co-operation with eu members . after struggling to overcome a major economic crisis for one and a half decades , japan is now on its way to defining a more assertive foreign policy .
shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .

the european commission will also propose wednesday , during the unveiling of its energy policy , that the eu commit to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , an eu source said tuesday . dramatic climate change in germany confirming some of the eu study 's results on tuesday , the german agency for maritime affairs and hydrography -lrb- bsh -rrb- said that global warming effects on in the north sea and baltic sea could no longer be prevented , but on mitigated by lowering carbon dioxide emissions .

us officials confirmed that the attack killed one of three al qaeda suspects .
according to cnn , somali officials said the airstrike killed the suspected orchestrator of the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa . on wednesday , reports trickled in of a fresh us strike close to a coastal village near the kenyan border where many fugitive somali islamists were believed to be hiding after being ousted by ethiopian troops defending somalia 's interim government . ' unilateral initiatives ' un spokeswoman michele montas said new un chief ban ki-moon was distressed by washington 's move . " the secretary-general is concerned about the new dimension this kind of action could introduce to the conflict and the possible escalation of hostilities that may result , " montas said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said rome opposed " unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions in an area that is already very destabilized . " norway , a member of the international contact group on somalia along with italy , said it was not satisfied with washington 's explanation of its conduct in somalia and stressed that terrorism should be fought in a court room and not with military hardware . the european commission also slammed us moves to hunt down al qaeda operatives in somalia . " any incident of this kind is not helpful in the long term , " a spokesman for the eu commission told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
" only a political solution can bring any serious prospects of peace and stability in somalia . " al qaeda members may have been killed washington believes that hardline islamists in the region in and around somalia have for years been harboring three al qaeda members wanted for their roles in the 1998 bombings of us embassies in nairobi , kenya and dar es salaam in tanzania . the us is in particular looking for an al qaeda operative , abu talha al-sudani , a sudanese identified in evidence given against osama bin laden as an explosives expert .
washington believes he financed and directed the 2002 hotel bombing in kenya . however , according to somali officials , american air raids may have killed the suspected al qaeda terrorist who planned the 1998 united states embassy bombings in east africa . “ i have received a report from the american side chronicling the targets and list of damage , ” abdirizak hassan , the somali president ’ s chief of staff , told the associated press .
“ one of the items they were claiming was that fazul abdullah muhammad is dead . ” american officials have said that mr. muhammad , 32 , planned the attacks on the american embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed 225 people . experts question timing of us strike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german peacekeeper in mombasa in 2002 as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom but , experts are questioning the timing of the us strikes on somalia considering that last week washington had the stressed the importance of political negotiations within the somalia contact group and had also signaled it might provide funds for an african peacekeeping force in the country . annette weber , an expert on somalia at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs criticized the timing of the us attack " at a time when the americans should be strategically adopting very different positions . " weber told deutsche welle that the us did n't seem to have a well-thought out concept for bolstering their battle against terrorism in the region , which is called " enduring freedom . " " there is no plan to keep the horn of africa stable , " weber said , adding that the us had tried to hunt down individuals and clans at the risk of squandering away the search for a solution for the whole country .

" a solution has been found , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in an interview published wednesday .
" the participants have reached an agreement .
the final details are now being worked out .

daimlerchrysler would retain its voting rights . " it is an interim solution , it 's no more than a loan , " the source said , adding that it would n't be unrealistic to hold the stake for three or four years . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported that the deal would be based on a complex construction of derivative securities that would run for a number of years .

20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table .

20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .

over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .

they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .

" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .

" credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes . " we 've been able to increase the pressure on pedophiles in recent years , but the deeper we look the bigger the magnitude of this crime appears to get , " he said . in germany , the depiction of sexual acts by anyone under the age of 14 is considered child pornography .
in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .
but , he added , a huge number remain undetected , as child pornography is a rapidly growing market in the internet era . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

" he believes i am pro-nazi , " chapmann told reed .
" i believe dr. graumann will keep his promise .
then i will assassinate hitler ... with my knowledge of explosives and incendiary material , it should be possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during a speech in may 1937 in germany however , reed pointed out that any attempt to kill hitler would be suicidal . " whether or not you succeeded , you would be liquidated immediately , " reed said . " ah , but what a way out ! "
chapman replied . no " wild enterprises " in a report back to his superiors , reed reportedly advised against following up on chapman 's idea . " he -lrb- chapman -rrb- can think of no better way of leaving this life than to have his name prominently featured throughout the world 's press and to be immortalized in history books for all time . "
reed also believed that chapman was motivated by patriotism as well as a desire to make amends for his criminal past . macintyre said that winston churchill , britain 's wartime prime minister , would have been made aware of the offer .
but chapman was explicitly told " not to undertake any wild enterprises " by his british spymaster , colonel tommy robertson . new evidence suggests that chapman 's german spymaster was a bitter opponent of hitler who may have been aware of the plan and given it his backing , macintyre wrote . chapman , a professional criminal and safe-cracker , was reportedly serving a sentence in jersey prison when the nazis invaded the channel islands in june 1940 . he was recruited by german military intelligence and parachuted back into britain in december 1941 .
he immediately defected to m15 . chapman died in 1997 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .
the japanese guest made it abundantly clear that other nations had nothing to fear from a more assertive japan which would by no means seek to return to imperial militarism . business opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be doing business with germany ?

he 's scored a pair of goals , but what 's perhaps even more impressive is that he 's only picked up a lone yellow card in 15 appearances . in the middle , there 's no getting around bremen 's naldo .

no one from bayern made the starting squad , and it contains a few unfamiliar names as well as a fabulous foursome who have led bremen to the very top . the strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's marko pantelic has silenced all the critics any list of the bundesliga 's best has to start with bremen 's miroslav klose .
he stumbled a bit after a tough world cup campaign , but the winter break sees him sharing the honors as the season 's top goal-getter .
the only bad news : klose is so good he 'll likely leave the bundesliga for one of europe 's biggest clubs when his contract expires this summer . like klose , hertha berlin 's marko pantelic is on 10 goals - but he 's done it without bremen 's well-oiled offensive machine setting him up .
once known as a petulant prima donna , the serbian striker has been relentlessly positive this season , leading a rebuilding hertha squad to a respectable fifth in the table . on the bench : mario gomez -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , roy makaay -lrb- bayern -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- aachen -rrb- the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's zvjezdan misimovic has been deadly with free kicks here , too , we start with bremen .
the big question for werder this season was whether diego could replace johan micoud as playmaker .
eight goals and 10 assists later , that issue has been laid to rest .
the lightning-quick brazilian has shredded opposing defenses , finding open teammates and , when necessary , the back of the net . zvjezdan misimovic does n't get the press diego does , but bochum 's bosnian playmaker is arguably more important to his team .
his five goals and seven assists have helped an anything-but-stellar squad escape the relegation zone .
bayern munich may be regretting letting him go in 2004 . jawhar mnari is one of the main reasons why nuremberg are sitting comfortably in the standings .
the tunesian national has been rock solid in defensive midfield and provides the crucial link between the back four and the attack .
he 's also one of the league 's best penalty takers , having converted two for two from the spot . and as a stopper , bremen 's torsten frings takes the honors .
he came into his own during the world cup , and he 's played every single bundesliga minute for werder this season .
it 's no accident that bremen 's worst defeat this season - to an amateur club in the german cup - came when the german midfielder was out with injury . on the bench : pavel pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- bayern -rrb- , laurentiu reghecampf -lrb- aachen -rrb- , albert streit -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- the defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder 's naldo is both a heady defender and a goal-getter occupying the right-hand side of the back line is stuttgart 's serdar tasci .
though only 19 years of age , he 's established himself as a regular starter for this season 's surprise overachievers .
he 's scored a pair of goals , but what 's perhaps even more impressive is that he 's only picked up a lone yellow card in 15 appearances . in the middle , there 's no getting around bremen 's naldo .
the huge brazilian is werder 's most improved player and he 's also the league 's highest scoring defender .
six goals this season , including a hattrick against frankfurt in december , have shown that he 's a force to be reckoned with at both ends of the field . alongside naldo is another giant , wolfsburg 's alexander madlung .
the young german anchors the league 's stingiest defense and he 's learned to play with discipline , having yet to be booked this season .
what 's more , with two goals to his name , he 's responsible for one-sixth of the wolves ' otherwise anemic offense . on the left-hand side , we have schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
although more of a midfielder , the georgian international has played at the back for most of the season , and he 's acquitted himself well , scoring three goals .
more importantly , his no-nonsense play helped schalke settle down after some early-season turmoil and finish 2006 level on points with bremen . on the bench : per mertesacker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kevin hofland -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , matthieu delpierre -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelo bordon -lrb- schalke -rrb- the goalkee per bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is one of the few balls to get past dortmund 's roman weidenfeller finally , it 's hard to choose among the array of excellent goalkeepers in the bundesliga , but our nod goes to dortmund 's roman weidenfeller .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .

" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .

chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .

the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .

for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .
the japanese guest made it abundantly clear that other nations had nothing to fear from a more assertive japan which would by no means seek to return to imperial militarism . business opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be doing business with germany ?
he added he hoped there would be enough understanding for tokyo 's current drive to play a greater role in international politics . abe told the german chancellor that he viewed the enlarged european union as an area of increased business opportunities .
on the fringes of political talks in berlin , japan and germany signed a treaty on the delivery of german top-notch environmental technology which will help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .

20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .

it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .

" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes .

in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 eu unveils major new energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu energy strategy will be debated on feb .
20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table . " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile said the eu should not bank on nuclear power . " if they put excessive emphasis on atomic energy in their energy policy , then we 'll have a debate with the commission , " gabriel told germany 's ard public television on wednesday . eu leaders will decide the commission 's plans will be submitted to eu heads of state and government at a march summit with a view to forge a broad-ranging common energy policy . until now energy policy has been largely conducted along national lines , but recent oil price jumps and disruptions of russian gas supplies last year have focused leaders ' minds on an ambitious joint eu approach . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu study warns of catastrophe if global warming not curbed an eu study on climate change to be released wednesday has warned of drought-like conditions , catastrophic damage to business and tens of thousands of dead if urgent steps are n't taken to check global warming .

" a solution has been found , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in an interview published wednesday .
" the participants have reached an agreement .
the final details are now being worked out . " a deal was scheduled to be announced next week or the week after next , wilhelm added . a consortium of banks is set to take over a 7.5 percent share in eads , but plans to hold it only for a few years , before reselling it to daimlerchrysler , the reuters news agency reported , citing an anonymous source familiar with the deal .
daimlerchrysler would retain its voting rights . " it is an interim solution , it 's no more than a loan , " the source said , adding that it would n't be unrealistic to hold the stake for three or four years . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported that the deal would be based on a complex construction of derivative securities that would run for a number of years .
observers value the share at 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.95 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to be on an even keel with france media reports have said the consortium would include deutsche bank , commerzbank , kfw kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau , a number of regional public-sector banks , or landesbanken , and three non-german financial institutes : goldman sachs , morgan stanley and credit suisse .
germany wants to keep a balance germany is currently represented in the european aeronautics defense and space company via a 22.5 percent share held by german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler .
french interests are controlled by the holding company sogeade , which holds 15 percent and is controlled by the french state .
a further 15 percent share is owned by the media and defense group lagardere , which also plans to sell 7.5 percent , reducing the french stake of 22.5 percent . but daimlerchrysler has made it known that it wants to reduce its stake to 15 percent , raising the question of what would happen to the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale . berlin insists the stake should remain in german hands in order to maintain the current balance of power . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boeing overtakes airbus in new orders for 2006 us airplane maker boeing has overtaken europe 's floundering airbus consortium , ending five years of runner-up status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 reader response : " europe needs energy independence " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative energy does n't help much if we 're still using lots of it , said one reader oil supplies from russia to europe were disrupted this week , and the eu unfurled a revamped energy policy .
dw readers wrote in with their thoughts and suggestions on europe 's energy woes . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .
let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .
one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .
today , russia is too big and important of an energy supplier to countries such as germany .
even if germany invested further in nuclear power plants , solar and wind energy and further , russian energy will remain too important to the entire eu community . - atilla a. iftikhar compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power in germany : a chronology half a century has passed since germany began exploring nuclear energy .
dw-world.de takes a look at the history of atomic power and protests against its use in the country .
-lrb- 10.01.2007 -rrb- eu unveils major new energy policy the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition .
-lrb- 10.01.2007 -rrb- russia faces angry eu in energy dispute german chancellor merkel said tuesday that disruption of oil supplies to europe was destroying confidence in moscow .
her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .
the japanese guest made it abundantly clear that other nations had nothing to fear from a more assertive japan which would by no means seek to return to imperial militarism . business opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be doing business with germany ?
he added he hoped there would be enough understanding for tokyo 's current drive to play a greater role in international politics . abe told the german chancellor that he viewed the enlarged european union as an area of increased business opportunities .
on the fringes of political talks in berlin , japan and germany signed a treaty on the delivery of german top-notch environmental technology which will help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .
but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .

one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .

one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .

the study says global co2 emissions should be immediately cut by 15 percent and should be lowered by almost 50 percent by 2050 . the report is part of a broad review of the eu 's energy policies .
the european commission will also propose wednesday , during the unveiling of its energy policy , that the eu commit to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , an eu source said tuesday . dramatic climate change in germany confirming some of the eu study 's results on tuesday , the german agency for maritime affairs and hydrography -lrb- bsh -rrb- said that global warming effects on in the north sea and baltic sea could no longer be prevented , but on mitigated by lowering carbon dioxide emissions .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .

we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .

in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes . " we 've been able to increase the pressure on pedophiles in recent years , but the deeper we look the bigger the magnitude of this crime appears to get , " he said . in germany , the depiction of sexual acts by anyone under the age of 14 is considered child pornography .
in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .

daimlerchrysler would retain its voting rights .

" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 reader response : " europe needs energy independence " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative energy does n't help much if we 're still using lots of it , said one reader oil supplies from russia to europe were disrupted this week , and the eu unfurled a revamped energy policy .
dw readers wrote in with their thoughts and suggestions on europe 's energy woes . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .
let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .

dw readers wrote in with their thoughts and suggestions on europe 's energy woes . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .

let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .
one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .
the japanese guest made it abundantly clear that other nations had nothing to fear from a more assertive japan which would by no means seek to return to imperial militarism . business opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be doing business with germany ?
he added he hoped there would be enough understanding for tokyo 's current drive to play a greater role in international politics . abe told the german chancellor that he viewed the enlarged european union as an area of increased business opportunities .
on the fringes of political talks in berlin , japan and germany signed a treaty on the delivery of german top-notch environmental technology which will help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 10.01.2007 german police smash child porn ring using credit card data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperation between credit card issuers and the police led to 322 arrests german police have cracked a major child pornography ring that swapped illegal images on the internet .
the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes . " we 've been able to increase the pressure on pedophiles in recent years , but the deeper we look the bigger the magnitude of this crime appears to get , " he said . in germany , the depiction of sexual acts by anyone under the age of 14 is considered child pornography .
in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .
but , he added , a huge number remain undetected , as child pornography is a rapidly growing market in the internet era . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "

us officials confirmed that the attack killed one of three al qaeda suspects .
according to cnn , somali officials said the airstrike killed the suspected orchestrator of the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa . on wednesday , reports trickled in of a fresh us strike close to a coastal village near the kenyan border where many fugitive somali islamists were believed to be hiding after being ousted by ethiopian troops defending somalia 's interim government . ' unilateral initiatives ' un spokeswoman michele montas said new un chief ban ki-moon was distressed by washington 's move . " the secretary-general is concerned about the new dimension this kind of action could introduce to the conflict and the possible escalation of hostilities that may result , " montas said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said rome opposed " unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions in an area that is already very destabilized . " norway , a member of the international contact group on somalia along with italy , said it was not satisfied with washington 's explanation of its conduct in somalia and stressed that terrorism should be fought in a court room and not with military hardware . the european commission also slammed us moves to hunt down al qaeda operatives in somalia . " any incident of this kind is not helpful in the long term , " a spokesman for the eu commission told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
" only a political solution can bring any serious prospects of peace and stability in somalia . " al qaeda members may have been killed washington believes that hardline islamists in the region in and around somalia have for years been harboring three al qaeda members wanted for their roles in the 1998 bombings of us embassies in nairobi , kenya and dar es salaam in tanzania . the us is in particular looking for an al qaeda operative , abu talha al-sudani , a sudanese identified in evidence given against osama bin laden as an explosives expert .
washington believes he financed and directed the 2002 hotel bombing in kenya . however , according to somali officials , american air raids may have killed the suspected al qaeda terrorist who planned the 1998 united states embassy bombings in east africa . “ i have received a report from the american side chronicling the targets and list of damage , ” abdirizak hassan , the somali president ’ s chief of staff , told the associated press .
“ one of the items they were claiming was that fazul abdullah muhammad is dead . ” american officials have said that mr. muhammad , 32 , planned the attacks on the american embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed 225 people . experts question timing of us strike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german peacekeeper in mombasa in 2002 as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom but , experts are questioning the timing of the us strikes on somalia considering that last week washington had the stressed the importance of political negotiations within the somalia contact group and had also signaled it might provide funds for an african peacekeeping force in the country . annette weber , an expert on somalia at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs criticized the timing of the us attack " at a time when the americans should be strategically adopting very different positions . " weber told deutsche welle that the us did n't seem to have a well-thought out concept for bolstering their battle against terrorism in the region , which is called " enduring freedom . " " there is no plan to keep the horn of africa stable , " weber said , adding that the us had tried to hunt down individuals and clans at the risk of squandering away the search for a solution for the whole country . " the fragmentation that will take place now , the return to the old warlord system wo n't really be helpful in reaching the aims of ' enduring freedom ' .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .

over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .

" the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes . " we 've been able to increase the pressure on pedophiles in recent years , but the deeper we look the bigger the magnitude of this crime appears to get , " he said . in germany , the depiction of sexual acts by anyone under the age of 14 is considered child pornography .
in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 10.01.2007 german police smash child porn ring using credit card data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperation between credit card issuers and the police led to 322 arrests german police have cracked a major child pornography ring that swapped illegal images on the internet .
the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes . " we 've been able to increase the pressure on pedophiles in recent years , but the deeper we look the bigger the magnitude of this crime appears to get , " he said . in germany , the depiction of sexual acts by anyone under the age of 14 is considered child pornography .
in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .

" we 've been able to increase the pressure on pedophiles in recent years , but the deeper we look the bigger the magnitude of this crime appears to get , " he said . in germany , the depiction of sexual acts by anyone under the age of 14 is considered child pornography .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .
the japanese guest made it abundantly clear that other nations had nothing to fear from a more assertive japan which would by no means seek to return to imperial militarism . business opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be doing business with germany ?
he added he hoped there would be enough understanding for tokyo 's current drive to play a greater role in international politics . abe told the german chancellor that he viewed the enlarged european union as an area of increased business opportunities .
on the fringes of political talks in berlin , japan and germany signed a treaty on the delivery of german top-notch environmental technology which will help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .

us officials confirmed that the attack killed one of three al qaeda suspects .
according to cnn , somali officials said the airstrike killed the suspected orchestrator of the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa . on wednesday , reports trickled in of a fresh us strike close to a coastal village near the kenyan border where many fugitive somali islamists were believed to be hiding after being ousted by ethiopian troops defending somalia 's interim government . ' unilateral initiatives ' un spokeswoman michele montas said new un chief ban ki-moon was distressed by washington 's move . " the secretary-general is concerned about the new dimension this kind of action could introduce to the conflict and the possible escalation of hostilities that may result , " montas said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said rome opposed " unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions in an area that is already very destabilized . " norway , a member of the international contact group on somalia along with italy , said it was not satisfied with washington 's explanation of its conduct in somalia and stressed that terrorism should be fought in a court room and not with military hardware . the european commission also slammed us moves to hunt down al qaeda operatives in somalia . " any incident of this kind is not helpful in the long term , " a spokesman for the eu commission told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
" only a political solution can bring any serious prospects of peace and stability in somalia . " al qaeda members may have been killed washington believes that hardline islamists in the region in and around somalia have for years been harboring three al qaeda members wanted for their roles in the 1998 bombings of us embassies in nairobi , kenya and dar es salaam in tanzania . the us is in particular looking for an al qaeda operative , abu talha al-sudani , a sudanese identified in evidence given against osama bin laden as an explosives expert .
washington believes he financed and directed the 2002 hotel bombing in kenya . however , according to somali officials , american air raids may have killed the suspected al qaeda terrorist who planned the 1998 united states embassy bombings in east africa . “ i have received a report from the american side chronicling the targets and list of damage , ” abdirizak hassan , the somali president ’ s chief of staff , told the associated press .
“ one of the items they were claiming was that fazul abdullah muhammad is dead . ” american officials have said that mr. muhammad , 32 , planned the attacks on the american embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed 225 people . experts question timing of us strike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german peacekeeper in mombasa in 2002 as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom but , experts are questioning the timing of the us strikes on somalia considering that last week washington had the stressed the importance of political negotiations within the somalia contact group and had also signaled it might provide funds for an african peacekeeping force in the country . annette weber , an expert on somalia at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs criticized the timing of the us attack " at a time when the americans should be strategically adopting very different positions . " weber told deutsche welle that the us did n't seem to have a well-thought out concept for bolstering their battle against terrorism in the region , which is called " enduring freedom . " " there is no plan to keep the horn of africa stable , " weber said , adding that the us had tried to hunt down individuals and clans at the risk of squandering away the search for a solution for the whole country . " the fragmentation that will take place now , the return to the old warlord system wo n't really be helpful in reaching the aims of ' enduring freedom ' .

glos has criticized brussels for the co2 emissions targets that he says would hurt german firms .

" we get one third of our electricity from nuclear energy and if we want to phase out nuclear by 2020 then we either need to replace these sources or find energy savings , " merkel said .

us officials confirmed that the attack killed one of three al qaeda suspects .
according to cnn , somali officials said the airstrike killed the suspected orchestrator of the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa . on wednesday , reports trickled in of a fresh us strike close to a coastal village near the kenyan border where many fugitive somali islamists were believed to be hiding after being ousted by ethiopian troops defending somalia 's interim government . ' unilateral initiatives ' un spokeswoman michele montas said new un chief ban ki-moon was distressed by washington 's move . " the secretary-general is concerned about the new dimension this kind of action could introduce to the conflict and the possible escalation of hostilities that may result , " montas said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said rome opposed " unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions in an area that is already very destabilized . " norway , a member of the international contact group on somalia along with italy , said it was not satisfied with washington 's explanation of its conduct in somalia and stressed that terrorism should be fought in a court room and not with military hardware . the european commission also slammed us moves to hunt down al qaeda operatives in somalia . " any incident of this kind is not helpful in the long term , " a spokesman for the eu commission told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
" only a political solution can bring any serious prospects of peace and stability in somalia .

us officials confirmed that the attack killed one of three al qaeda suspects .
according to cnn , somali officials said the airstrike killed the suspected orchestrator of the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa . on wednesday , reports trickled in of a fresh us strike close to a coastal village near the kenyan border where many fugitive somali islamists were believed to be hiding after being ousted by ethiopian troops defending somalia 's interim government . ' unilateral initiatives ' un spokeswoman michele montas said new un chief ban ki-moon was distressed by washington 's move . " the secretary-general is concerned about the new dimension this kind of action could introduce to the conflict and the possible escalation of hostilities that may result , " montas said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said rome opposed " unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions in an area that is already very destabilized . " norway , a member of the international contact group on somalia along with italy , said it was not satisfied with washington 's explanation of its conduct in somalia and stressed that terrorism should be fought in a court room and not with military hardware . the european commission also slammed us moves to hunt down al qaeda operatives in somalia . " any incident of this kind is not helpful in the long term , " a spokesman for the eu commission told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
" only a political solution can bring any serious prospects of peace and stability in somalia .

" a solution has been found , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in an interview published wednesday .
" the participants have reached an agreement .
the final details are now being worked out . " a deal was scheduled to be announced next week or the week after next , wilhelm added . a consortium of banks is set to take over a 7.5 percent share in eads , but plans to hold it only for a few years , before reselling it to daimlerchrysler , the reuters news agency reported , citing an anonymous source familiar with the deal .
daimlerchrysler would retain its voting rights . " it is an interim solution , it 's no more than a loan , " the source said , adding that it would n't be unrealistic to hold the stake for three or four years . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported that the deal would be based on a complex construction of derivative securities that would run for a number of years .
observers value the share at 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.95 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to be on an even keel with france media reports have said the consortium would include deutsche bank , commerzbank , kfw kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau , a number of regional public-sector banks , or landesbanken , and three non-german financial institutes : goldman sachs , morgan stanley and credit suisse .
germany wants to keep a balance germany is currently represented in the european aeronautics defense and space company via a 22.5 percent share held by german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler .
french interests are controlled by the holding company sogeade , which holds 15 percent and is controlled by the french state .
a further 15 percent share is owned by the media and defense group lagardere , which also plans to sell 7.5 percent , reducing the french stake of 22.5 percent . but daimlerchrysler has made it known that it wants to reduce its stake to 15 percent , raising the question of what would happen to the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale . berlin insists the stake should remain in german hands in order to maintain the current balance of power . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boeing overtakes airbus in new orders for 2006 us airplane maker boeing has overtaken europe 's floundering airbus consortium , ending five years of runner-up status .

" a solution has been found , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in an interview published wednesday .
" the participants have reached an agreement .
the final details are now being worked out . " a deal was scheduled to be announced next week or the week after next , wilhelm added . a consortium of banks is set to take over a 7.5 percent share in eads , but plans to hold it only for a few years , before reselling it to daimlerchrysler , the reuters news agency reported , citing an anonymous source familiar with the deal .
daimlerchrysler would retain its voting rights . " it is an interim solution , it 's no more than a loan , " the source said , adding that it would n't be unrealistic to hold the stake for three or four years . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported that the deal would be based on a complex construction of derivative securities that would run for a number of years .
observers value the share at 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.95 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to be on an even keel with france media reports have said the consortium would include deutsche bank , commerzbank , kfw kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau , a number of regional public-sector banks , or landesbanken , and three non-german financial institutes : goldman sachs , morgan stanley and credit suisse .
germany wants to keep a balance germany is currently represented in the european aeronautics defense and space company via a 22.5 percent share held by german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler .
french interests are controlled by the holding company sogeade , which holds 15 percent and is controlled by the french state .
a further 15 percent share is owned by the media and defense group lagardere , which also plans to sell 7.5 percent , reducing the french stake of 22.5 percent . but daimlerchrysler has made it known that it wants to reduce its stake to 15 percent , raising the question of what would happen to the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale . berlin insists the stake should remain in german hands in order to maintain the current balance of power . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boeing overtakes airbus in new orders for 2006 us airplane maker boeing has overtaken europe 's floundering airbus consortium , ending five years of runner-up status .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .

it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .

we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .

it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .

on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.01.2007 japan 's abe , merkel discuss north korea in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abe and merkel in berlin on wednesday japanese premier shinzo abe on wednesday met with his german counterpart in berlin to explain his country 's current drive to redefine its foreign policy guidelines and increase economic co-operation with eu members . after struggling to overcome a major economic crisis for one and a half decades , japan is now on its way to defining a more assertive foreign policy .
shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .
the japanese guest made it abundantly clear that other nations had nothing to fear from a more assertive japan which would by no means seek to return to imperial militarism . business opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be doing business with germany ?
he added he hoped there would be enough understanding for tokyo 's current drive to play a greater role in international politics . abe told the german chancellor that he viewed the enlarged european union as an area of increased business opportunities .
on the fringes of political talks in berlin , japan and germany signed a treaty on the delivery of german top-notch environmental technology which will help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .

the study says global co2 emissions should be immediately cut by 15 percent and should be lowered by almost 50 percent by 2050 . the report is part of a broad review of the eu 's energy policies .
the european commission will also propose wednesday , during the unveiling of its energy policy , that the eu commit to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , an eu source said tuesday . dramatic climate change in germany confirming some of the eu study 's results on tuesday , the german agency for maritime affairs and hydrography -lrb- bsh -rrb- said that global warming effects on in the north sea and baltic sea could no longer be prevented , but on mitigated by lowering carbon dioxide emissions .

" he believes i am pro-nazi , " chapmann told reed .
" i believe dr. graumann will keep his promise .
then i will assassinate hitler ... with my knowledge of explosives and incendiary material , it should be possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during a speech in may 1937 in germany however , reed pointed out that any attempt to kill hitler would be suicidal . " whether or not you succeeded , you would be liquidated immediately , " reed said . " ah , but what a way out ! "
chapman replied . no " wild enterprises " in a report back to his superiors , reed reportedly advised against following up on chapman 's idea . " he -lrb- chapman -rrb- can think of no better way of leaving this life than to have his name prominently featured throughout the world 's press and to be immortalized in history books for all time . "
reed also believed that chapman was motivated by patriotism as well as a desire to make amends for his criminal past . macintyre said that winston churchill , britain 's wartime prime minister , would have been made aware of the offer .
but chapman was explicitly told " not to undertake any wild enterprises " by his british spymaster , colonel tommy robertson . new evidence suggests that chapman 's german spymaster was a bitter opponent of hitler who may have been aware of the plan and given it his backing , macintyre wrote . chapman , a professional criminal and safe-cracker , was reportedly serving a sentence in jersey prison when the nazis invaded the channel islands in june 1940 . he was recruited by german military intelligence and parachuted back into britain in december 1941 .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

" we get one third of our electricity from nuclear energy and if we want to phase out nuclear by 2020 then we either need to replace these sources or find energy savings , " merkel said .

shinzo abe 's visit to berlin has come shortly after japan launched its first fully-fledged defense ministry since world war ii . tokyo 's present top policy priorities are a more assertive foreign policy , as well as aspirations to rewrite the us-imposed 1947 constitution , which declared japan a pacifist state .
apart from reassuring each other of their increased economic and environmental co-operation , abe and german chancellor angela merkel debated current issues related to north korea 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans demonstrating against north korean nuclear bomb tests " the prime minister talked to me about his idea of a modern japanese foreign and security policy , " merkel said .
" there 's a lot of common ground between our two sides , particularly as far as our stance towards north korea is concerned .
we both have a vested interest in the success of the six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program .
we call on north korea to end its nuclear program , and we do n't like the idea of them possessing nuclear weapons , or should i say , more nuclear weapons . " we understand that for japan this issue is of crucial importance and affects the country 's security perception directly , " merkel added .
" as far as germany is concerned , we 're willing to do everything in our power to help resolve the ongoing conflict . " zero tolerance abe added that there would be unforeseeable consequences if the talks were to fail . " japan can not tolerate a nuclear-armed north korea , " he said .
" every diplomatic channel will have to be used to find a speedy solution to the conflict .
if the north koreans possess nuclear weapons , the uncontrolled proliferation of such arms might only be one step away .
hence the international community must come closer together to help achieve a breakthrough in talks . " abe and merkel also both stated that they were opposed to lifting the current arms embargo against china .
the japanese guest made it abundantly clear that other nations had nothing to fear from a more assertive japan which would by no means seek to return to imperial militarism . business opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be doing business with germany ?
he added he hoped there would be enough understanding for tokyo 's current drive to play a greater role in international politics . abe told the german chancellor that he viewed the enlarged european union as an area of increased business opportunities .
on the fringes of political talks in berlin , japan and germany signed a treaty on the delivery of german top-notch environmental technology which will help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .
but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country .
-lrb- 21.02.2006 -rrb- " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .
dw-world.de spoke with schmidt about his ties to china and the country 's growing global clout .

us officials confirmed that the attack killed one of three al qaeda suspects .
according to cnn , somali officials said the airstrike killed the suspected orchestrator of the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa . on wednesday , reports trickled in of a fresh us strike close to a coastal village near the kenyan border where many fugitive somali islamists were believed to be hiding after being ousted by ethiopian troops defending somalia 's interim government . ' unilateral initiatives ' un spokeswoman michele montas said new un chief ban ki-moon was distressed by washington 's move . " the secretary-general is concerned about the new dimension this kind of action could introduce to the conflict and the possible escalation of hostilities that may result , " montas said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said rome opposed " unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions in an area that is already very destabilized . " norway , a member of the international contact group on somalia along with italy , said it was not satisfied with washington 's explanation of its conduct in somalia and stressed that terrorism should be fought in a court room and not with military hardware . the european commission also slammed us moves to hunt down al qaeda operatives in somalia . " any incident of this kind is not helpful in the long term , " a spokesman for the eu commission told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
" only a political solution can bring any serious prospects of peace and stability in somalia . " al qaeda members may have been killed washington believes that hardline islamists in the region in and around somalia have for years been harboring three al qaeda members wanted for their roles in the 1998 bombings of us embassies in nairobi , kenya and dar es salaam in tanzania . the us is in particular looking for an al qaeda operative , abu talha al-sudani , a sudanese identified in evidence given against osama bin laden as an explosives expert .
washington believes he financed and directed the 2002 hotel bombing in kenya . however , according to somali officials , american air raids may have killed the suspected al qaeda terrorist who planned the 1998 united states embassy bombings in east africa . “ i have received a report from the american side chronicling the targets and list of damage , ” abdirizak hassan , the somali president ’ s chief of staff , told the associated press .
“ one of the items they were claiming was that fazul abdullah muhammad is dead . ” american officials have said that mr. muhammad , 32 , planned the attacks on the american embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed 225 people . experts question timing of us strike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german peacekeeper in mombasa in 2002 as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom but , experts are questioning the timing of the us strikes on somalia considering that last week washington had the stressed the importance of political negotiations within the somalia contact group and had also signaled it might provide funds for an african peacekeeping force in the country . annette weber , an expert on somalia at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs criticized the timing of the us attack " at a time when the americans should be strategically adopting very different positions . " weber told deutsche welle that the us did n't seem to have a well-thought out concept for bolstering their battle against terrorism in the region , which is called " enduring freedom . " " there is no plan to keep the horn of africa stable , " weber said , adding that the us had tried to hunt down individuals and clans at the risk of squandering away the search for a solution for the whole country . " the fragmentation that will take place now , the return to the old warlord system wo n't really be helpful in reaching the aims of ' enduring freedom ' .

20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .

“ one of the items they were claiming was that fazul abdullah muhammad is dead . ” american officials have said that mr. muhammad , 32 , planned the attacks on the american embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed 225 people . experts question timing of us strike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german peacekeeper in mombasa in 2002 as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom but , experts are questioning the timing of the us strikes on somalia considering that last week washington had the stressed the importance of political negotiations within the somalia contact group and had also signaled it might provide funds for an african peacekeeping force in the country . annette weber , an expert on somalia at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs criticized the timing of the us attack " at a time when the americans should be strategically adopting very different positions . " weber told deutsche welle that the us did n't seem to have a well-thought out concept for bolstering their battle against terrorism in the region , which is called " enduring freedom . " " there is no plan to keep the horn of africa stable , " weber said , adding that the us had tried to hunt down individuals and clans at the risk of squandering away the search for a solution for the whole country . " the fragmentation that will take place now , the return to the old warlord system wo n't really be helpful in reaching the aims of ' enduring freedom ' .

" he believes i am pro-nazi , " chapmann told reed .
" i believe dr. graumann will keep his promise .
then i will assassinate hitler ... with my knowledge of explosives and incendiary material , it should be possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during a speech in may 1937 in germany however , reed pointed out that any attempt to kill hitler would be suicidal . " whether or not you succeeded , you would be liquidated immediately , " reed said . " ah , but what a way out ! "
chapman replied . no " wild enterprises " in a report back to his superiors , reed reportedly advised against following up on chapman 's idea . " he -lrb- chapman -rrb- can think of no better way of leaving this life than to have his name prominently featured throughout the world 's press and to be immortalized in history books for all time . "
reed also believed that chapman was motivated by patriotism as well as a desire to make amends for his criminal past . macintyre said that winston churchill , britain 's wartime prime minister , would have been made aware of the offer .
but chapman was explicitly told " not to undertake any wild enterprises " by his british spymaster , colonel tommy robertson . new evidence suggests that chapman 's german spymaster was a bitter opponent of hitler who may have been aware of the plan and given it his backing , macintyre wrote . chapman , a professional criminal and safe-cracker , was reportedly serving a sentence in jersey prison when the nazis invaded the channel islands in june 1940 . he was recruited by german military intelligence and parachuted back into britain in december 1941 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 eu unveils major new energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu energy strategy will be debated on feb .
20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table . " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile said the eu should not bank on nuclear power . " if they put excessive emphasis on atomic energy in their energy policy , then we 'll have a debate with the commission , " gabriel told germany 's ard public television on wednesday . eu leaders will decide the commission 's plans will be submitted to eu heads of state and government at a march summit with a view to forge a broad-ranging common energy policy . until now energy policy has been largely conducted along national lines , but recent oil price jumps and disruptions of russian gas supplies last year have focused leaders ' minds on an ambitious joint eu approach . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu study warns of catastrophe if global warming not curbed an eu study on climate change to be released wednesday has warned of drought-like conditions , catastrophic damage to business and tens of thousands of dead if urgent steps are n't taken to check global warming .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .
let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .
one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .
today , russia is too big and important of an energy supplier to countries such as germany .
even if germany invested further in nuclear power plants , solar and wind energy and further , russian energy will remain too important to the entire eu community . - atilla a. iftikhar compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power in germany : a chronology half a century has passed since germany began exploring nuclear energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 germany wary about eu energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say renewable energy does n't receive the attention it deserves in the eu plan germany reacted cautiously wednesday to an eu plan to diversify energy sources , raising concerns about the new eu president 's ability to tackle the issue in the 27-member bloc . berlin on wednesday gave a wary nod to the european commission 's ambitious plan to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and increase competition among energy suppliers . the german government , which assumed the six-month european union presidency last week and has made fighting climate change one of its priorities , said it was largely in favor of the eu 's objectives even if it was not yet sure about how to achieve them . splits over emissions , nuclear power german chancellor angela merkel 's government is split on energy and climate policies , making it hard for her cabinet to fully endorse the eu energy security plan . in particular , one aspect of the eu 's energy strategy - a commission order to cut co2 allocations to industry for the 2008-2012 period to 453 million tons from their 465 million ton target - remains controversial . while german environment minister sigmar gabriel is in favor of the commission 's quotas on greenhouse gases , economy minister michael glos told reporters on wednesday he could not rule out legal action against the commission .
glos has criticized brussels for the co2 emissions targets that he says would hurt german firms . " economic growth will not help us if our environment is at risk but we need to achieve these objectives in a way which does not impinge on our competitiveness , " glos said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she 's in favor of extending the use of nuclear power merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are also at odds on nuclear power .
while the spd remains committed to a phase-out that will see all nuclear plants shut down by 2020 , the cdu is in favor of extending their life spans . merkel on wednesday reaffirmed that she was personally in favor of extending the use of nuclear power . " we get one third of our electricity from nuclear energy and if we want to phase out nuclear by 2020 then we either need to replace these sources or find energy savings , " merkel said .
" those that say we do n't want nuclear energy need to play a role in coming up with the answers . " energy heavyweights not happy the eu commission 's energy strategy was also greeted with skepticism by key players in germany 's energy sector . the gas industry federation bgw was angered by brussels ' proposals to compel big energy companies to unbundle their supply and generation businesses from their network operations . the commission was " fundamentally questioning the companies ' rights to ownership of their networks , " bgw said in a statement . bgw president michael feist warned that there was a danger , if companies felt their networks would be expropriated by the state , that companies would not invest in those networks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german gas companies are n't happy with some of the provisions in the eu plan " that will lead to a deterioration of the quality of supply , " feist argued . german economy minister glos was also critical of the eu measure . " the commission is now talking about unbundling ownership and we need to verify first whether this is compatible with the constitution , " glos said , adding that germany would not " take any hasty steps . " stronger push for renewables needed for others , some of the eu measures did n't go far enough . " the eu commission has n't the courage to lay down binding and clearly defined regulations , " the head of bee federation for renewable energy sources , milan nitzschke , said in a statement . " we 're currently seeing just how fatal the eu 's dependence is on energy supplies from russia .
if once again , no clear strategy is drawn up to expand renewable sources of energy , that will spotlight the shortcomings of european energy policy , " nitzschke said . the bee urged the government to push for an ambitious goal of making renewable energy sources account for 25 percent of all energy production by 2020 , instead of the 20 percent targeted by brussels . " only in this way can the eu 's greenhouse gas emissions and the bloc 's dramatic dependence on oil and gas imports be reduced , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power in germany : a chronology half a century has passed since germany began exploring nuclear energy .

daimlerchrysler would retain its voting rights .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .
oil and gas lines are very easily cut . - william n. powhida if i were german i would have started to build a pipeline to norway yesterday .
let the russians keep their gas for themselves . - peter ström götaland , sweden i figure europe has two options .
one is to keep making deals with oil suppliers , which would mean giving up more and more of its wealth and security .
or it could partner with the us and actually develop alternative energy sources in a massive effort similar to the apollo program and the marshall plan combined : that is , a massive research and development program and a massive infrastructure building program .
of course this makes too much sense , and neither europe or the us actually want to share the risks and rewards of such a massive undertaking .
what choice do we really have ?
as an american citizen , i know that whatever divides the us and europe is immaterial compared to the very real , very dangerous differences between us and the oil exporting countries like iran , venezuela , nigeria , russia and saudi arabia . - brian kegerreis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are questioning the 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power germany needs to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas .
it also needs to stop paying subsidies to the coal mines in northwest germany and end the " nuclear phase-out " scheme , which is a silly law .
if germany 's energy policy were more like france 's , it would not have problems with russian gas dependence or with meeting co2 emissions reduction goals .
on the positive side , i do like the structure of the german transport system , which is much more efficient than ours in the united states . - ruth sponsler germany and the eu can not avoid becoming dependent on russian or north african oil and gas supplies because no one in europe has an adequate amount of energy reserves to satisfy the demands of the eu .
norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .
today , russia is too big and important of an energy supplier to countries such as germany .

norway , the biggest european producer and exporter of oil is no match to countries such as russia , algeria or even libya concerning oil and gas reserves .

dw readers wrote in with their thoughts and suggestions on europe 's energy woes . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this question of how the eu can increase renewable energy consumption has an inherent problem to it that is often neglected .
we are trying to increase our renewable energy consumption without really reducing our energy consumption .
what is important in this entire energy debate is to achieve a reduction in our effective energy consumption , independent of the nature of this energy .
as a direct consequence we can then achieve an increase in the part of renewable energy used and thus slowly diverge from our carbon economy .
on the other hand , we should consider a means of increasing the economical viability of all known renewable energy technologies . - sebastian falkenberg i think that european countries should ignore russian oil and look for oil somewhere else .
germany , do n't you see that russia is leading you like a bull by your nose ? - harijs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barosso said russia had lost credibility as an energy supplier in the long view of european-russian relations , it would be prudent to avoid any economic changes that would destabilize the russian economy , as that would lead to political and social unrest which would not be in the security interests of germany or the eu .
while importing russian fuel can contribute to the energy security of germany and the eu , it would be prudent for germany to continue increasing its use of green energy sources and nuclear plants .
the french have proven that nuclear power plants can supply the bulk of energy for that country , and germany most certainly can do likewise .
germany should move to increase its energy independence while avoiding disaffecting the russians .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards . " credit card companies filtered accounts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators had combed the internet for half a year the suspected pedophiles could be identified because their credit cards were regularly charged the monthly sum of $ 79.99 -lrb- 61 euros -rrb- or because they transferred the amount to a certain bank account .
the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .
in the postwar era , germans showed great reluctance in allowing access to their personal information , and germany subsequently has passed strict data protection laws .
it appears , however , that resistance has begun to waver .
a grass roots movement agitated against a nationwide census 20 years ago but more than three-quarters of germans now have no qualms about responding to such a head count , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote on wednesday .
dragnet searches questionable saxony-anhalt 's chief prosecutor , peter vogt , said he did n't see any data protection problems in how the investigation was conducted . " the police did n't have access to the data from 20 million credit cards , " he told the tageszeitung newspaper .
" it only received the data of 322 suspects from the credit card companies .
they carried out the matching of the data themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police carried out raids in numerous german states but others were alarmed by the credit card companies working with the police . " the voluntary release of such data is highly questionable , for here , in principle , dragnet searches are simply outsourced to private firms , " said hartmut kilger , head of the german lawyers association dav in an interview with reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper . schleswig-holstein 's top data protection authority , thilo weichert , however , defended the operation .
" what was employed here is a classic method of investigation that ca n't be legally objected to . " but he added that there were " numerous possibilities for state prosecutors to get access to data in the field of banking and finance , which are highly problematic , " including dragnet searches .
" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .
struggle against windmills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating child pornography has become an international issue in the internet age investigator meyer admitted that fighting child pornography was a struggle against windmills in spite of the recent successes .

in the united states , in comparison , the age limit is 18 .
distribution of child pornography in germany carries a prison term of two to five years , while possessing such material means a maximum penalty of one year . meyer said that about 76 percent of child pornography cases are eventually solved .

the operation included an unprecedented examination of credit card data , which has some privacy experts concerned . in an operation code-named " mikado , " police in magdeburg searched the internet over a six-month period for pornographic images of children and sought to identify those who swapped them .
the hunt included the biggest search of credit card data in germany , involving basically all of this country 's more than 22 million cardholders . torsten meyer , the operation 's chief investigator at the saxon-anhalt state crime office , praised what he described as unprecedented cooperation from german banks and financial institutions . " we 've used an entirely new method of investigating this crime and all financial institutions here have been very forthcoming and cooperative in it , " meyer said on tuesday .
" we 've been able to arrest 322 suspects in all of germany , most of them rather affluent people who paid for the incriminating material with their credit cards .

the fee gave them access to a child pornography web site run from the philippines .
over the past week , police also searched the homes and offices of the suspects , seizing computers , videotapes and compact discs .

" there , positive characteristics that indicate a suspect are not searched for alone , but also characteristics with which one can only engage in speculation . "
the investigation - which was started after a tip-off from a german television show whose viewers brought the child porn ring to their attention - and its success recalled a case three years ago when investigators in magdeburg led a global investigation against child pornography .
at the time some 26,000 suspects in 166 countries were arrested on the basis of evidence gathered by the german specialists .

with partial eu funding , this mission aims to finally start identifying the victims of the war . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkey sent troops to the north of the country following an attempted coup backed by the greek government .
some 2,000 cypriots on both sides are still officially registered as missing as a result of the inter-communal troubles dating back to the early 1960s .
for more than 30 years , the issue of missing persons has been highly politicized in cyprus .
each side blames the other for lack of cooperation and effective investigation .
during this time , the families of the missing have lived in doubt about the fate of their loved ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at the un compound are trying to give families certainty but now , both communities are cooperating in excavating mass graves and returning the remains to the victims ' families .
a team of forensic scientists is working in a prefabricated un laboratory built in the buffer zone that still divides cyprus .
according to anthropologist oran finnegan , the main priority is identifying the skeletal remains .
he said they have to be put together like a jigsaw puzzle .
" we begin to look for features that will assist us : age range , whether male or female , did this person have an old fracture ? "
finnegan said .
" we look for specific dental work - gold fillings or crowns - and then we can look at the ante mortem date we receive from the families . "
in addition , the scientists take a bone sample for a dna lab to complete the final stage of identification .
finnegan said the families have high expectations and his team has to be certain that it will return the right remains to the right family .
" i 'm still holding on to hope . "
agni hadjinicolaou has been waiting for more than 30 years .
the 67-year-old energetic woman still recalls very clearly the day her husband christos was arrested by three turkish men from a neighboring village .
he and eight other men were put in a bus and have never been seen again .
agni said she first thought it was a routine interrogation , and that her husband would be back soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agni hadjinicolaou has never given up hope " for quite some years , i hoped he might be alive somewhere , " she said .
" but after over 30 years , it 's not humanly possible .
i 'm still holding on to hope , though , and i will until i see evidence that he 's dead . "
christos hadjinicolaou was a judge and went missing at the age of 35 .
his son spyros is now 37 and a lawyer .
he took up his own investigation , speaking to government officials and making inquiries in the north of cyprus , near the village where his father was arrested .
spyros said he knows his father is dead .
but now that he might get the remains back , he has mixed feelings .
" it 's something i do n't know how to handle , particularly when you know you will get the remains of someone younger than you are , " spyros said .
" so it 's quite bizarre .
on the other hand , it will be a relief . "
families are waiting for the uncertainty to end on the other side of the un buffer zone or " green line " that divides cyprus , the story is much the same .
emine degirmencioglu was 23 years old when greek cypriot fighters attacked her village in the winter of 1963 .
the family fled in panic and her husband munir disappeared , never to return .
" i never lost my hope until the borders opened in 2003 and turkish and greek cypriots could cross to the other side , " emine said .
at that time , she went to see the committee of missing persons -lrb- cmp -rrb- , where she was told soldiers had killed her husband .
bildunterschrift : forensic scientists face a difficult task identifying skeletal remains the cmp was established in 1981 and operates under the auspices of the united nations .
its aim is determining the fate of missing persons by establishing a complete list of victims , identifying burial sites , debriefing witnesses and exchanging information between greek and turkish cypriots .
today , all emine has left of munir is a black-and-white photograph of their wedding day .
she said it 's important to her to get his remains back for a proper religious burial .
like agni and spyros in southern cyprus , members of emine 's family have provided dna samples .
they are now hoping that the decades of waiting to find munir will finally come to an end .
working together helps break down barriers the committee 's un member christophe girod said things were finally moving after many years with little progress .
he said there were many encouraging signs .
" it 's a small island , and even though it 's more than 30 years later , the witnesses have not all passed away , " girod said .
" the more the project goes on , the more witnesses come out . "
out of the 200 sites that have been identified so far across the island , forensic teams have investigated eight and recovered the remains of around 100 missing persons .
at every site , greek and turkish scientists work together with the un forensic specialists .
gulden plumer kucuk , the turkish member on the cmp , said she had her doubts whether all the missing persons could be returned to their families .
still , she said this work was essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots work together at the exhumation sites " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation , " kucuk said .
" when i watch the bi-communal teams collecting remains together , i can see that they realize what a big mistake it was to fight with one another . "
chris anthe , a greek cypriot archeologist from the exhumation team , said this project would also eventually improve relations between greek and turkish cypriots .
for her , it had been a very meaningful experience .
for the first time , she had had real contact with turkish cypriot people , she said .
" it has killed a lot of the prejudices that i had , " anthe said .
demet karcula , a turkish cypriot archeologist , said she enjoyed working in a bi-communal team .
she said it was difficult at the beginning to exhume bodies that had been missing for 30 or 40 years .
but she felt it was part of the healing process .
greek and turkish remains are not separated .
" i am a turkish cypriot , but i feel the same when i find greek cypriot bodies , " karcula said .
" we are all cypriots . "
families would like an apology spyros hadjinicolaou said he expected to get the remains of his father back next year .
only then would it be time to think about justice .
the cmp was not mandated to investigate the causes of death , or to take legal steps , but only to return the remains to their families .
the need for justice existed , though , and was legitimate , spyros said .
he would prefer a process where the guilty come forward , admit their crimes and apologize , rather than pursuing lengthy criminal litigations in court .
considering the age of many involved , that would be pointless , he said .
for the time being , returning the remains of the more than 2,000 missing people continues to be the highest priority .
like spyros and agni , some cling to the hope of receiving their loved ones next year .
for some , the process could take up to five years - while others may never be found . barbara gruber send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic " this project is not only going to serve missing persons ' families , but will also help reconciliation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 10.01.2007 dw-world.de picks bundesliga dream team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with ten goals this season , miroslav klose is one of the league 's big winners our dream team may surprise some people .
no one from bayern made the starting squad , and it contains a few unfamiliar names as well as a fabulous foursome who have led bremen to the very top . the strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's marko pantelic has silenced all the critics any list of the bundesliga 's best has to start with bremen 's miroslav klose .
he stumbled a bit after a tough world cup campaign , but the winter break sees him sharing the honors as the season 's top goal-getter .
the only bad news : klose is so good he 'll likely leave the bundesliga for one of europe 's biggest clubs when his contract expires this summer . like klose , hertha berlin 's marko pantelic is on 10 goals - but he 's done it without bremen 's well-oiled offensive machine setting him up .
once known as a petulant prima donna , the serbian striker has been relentlessly positive this season , leading a rebuilding hertha squad to a respectable fifth in the table . on the bench : mario gomez -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , roy makaay -lrb- bayern -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- aachen -rrb- the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's zvjezdan misimovic has been deadly with free kicks here , too , we start with bremen .
the big question for werder this season was whether diego could replace johan micoud as playmaker .
eight goals and 10 assists later , that issue has been laid to rest .
the lightning-quick brazilian has shredded opposing defenses , finding open teammates and , when necessary , the back of the net . zvjezdan misimovic does n't get the press diego does , but bochum 's bosnian playmaker is arguably more important to his team .
his five goals and seven assists have helped an anything-but-stellar squad escape the relegation zone .
bayern munich may be regretting letting him go in 2004 . jawhar mnari is one of the main reasons why nuremberg are sitting comfortably in the standings .
the tunesian national has been rock solid in defensive midfield and provides the crucial link between the back four and the attack .
he 's also one of the league 's best penalty takers , having converted two for two from the spot . and as a stopper , bremen 's torsten frings takes the honors .
he came into his own during the world cup , and he 's played every single bundesliga minute for werder this season .
it 's no accident that bremen 's worst defeat this season - to an amateur club in the german cup - came when the german midfielder was out with injury . on the bench : pavel pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- bayern -rrb- , laurentiu reghecampf -lrb- aachen -rrb- , albert streit -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- the defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder 's naldo is both a heady defender and a goal-getter occupying the right-hand side of the back line is stuttgart 's serdar tasci .
though only 19 years of age , he 's established himself as a regular starter for this season 's surprise overachievers .
he 's scored a pair of goals , but what 's perhaps even more impressive is that he 's only picked up a lone yellow card in 15 appearances . in the middle , there 's no getting around bremen 's naldo .
the huge brazilian is werder 's most improved player and he 's also the league 's highest scoring defender .
six goals this season , including a hattrick against frankfurt in december , have shown that he 's a force to be reckoned with at both ends of the field . alongside naldo is another giant , wolfsburg 's alexander madlung .
the young german anchors the league 's stingiest defense and he 's learned to play with discipline , having yet to be booked this season .

20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .

" he believes i am pro-nazi , " chapmann told reed .
" i believe dr. graumann will keep his promise .
then i will assassinate hitler ... with my knowledge of explosives and incendiary material , it should be possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during a speech in may 1937 in germany however , reed pointed out that any attempt to kill hitler would be suicidal . " whether or not you succeeded , you would be liquidated immediately , " reed said . " ah , but what a way out ! "
chapman replied . no " wild enterprises " in a report back to his superiors , reed reportedly advised against following up on chapman 's idea . " he -lrb- chapman -rrb- can think of no better way of leaving this life than to have his name prominently featured throughout the world 's press and to be immortalized in history books for all time . "
reed also believed that chapman was motivated by patriotism as well as a desire to make amends for his criminal past . macintyre said that winston churchill , britain 's wartime prime minister , would have been made aware of the offer .
but chapman was explicitly told " not to undertake any wild enterprises " by his british spymaster , colonel tommy robertson . new evidence suggests that chapman 's german spymaster was a bitter opponent of hitler who may have been aware of the plan and given it his backing , macintyre wrote . chapman , a professional criminal and safe-cracker , was reportedly serving a sentence in jersey prison when the nazis invaded the channel islands in june 1940 . he was recruited by german military intelligence and parachuted back into britain in december 1941 .

he stumbled a bit after a tough world cup campaign , but the winter break sees him sharing the honors as the season 's top goal-getter .
the only bad news : klose is so good he 'll likely leave the bundesliga for one of europe 's biggest clubs when his contract expires this summer . like klose , hertha berlin 's marko pantelic is on 10 goals - but he 's done it without bremen 's well-oiled offensive machine setting him up .

the big question for werder this season was whether diego could replace johan micoud as playmaker .

the lightning-quick brazilian has shredded opposing defenses , finding open teammates and , when necessary , the back of the net . zvjezdan misimovic does n't get the press diego does , but bochum 's bosnian playmaker is arguably more important to his team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency energy -pipe- 10.01.2007 eu unveils major new energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu energy strategy will be debated on feb .
20 in brussels the european commission unveiled sweeping plans wednesday to diversify eu energy sources , slash carbon emissions by 20 percent and enforce rules for fuel competition . the commission presented the plan as the gateway to a " post industrial revolution " amid deep concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , breaches of eu energy principles by member governments and global warming . after recent oil spikes and tensions with russia over its gas and oil shipments and signs that some eu governments prefer national policies , eu commission president jose barroso called on the 27-nation bloc to " face new realities " with coherent eu action . " europe must lead the world into a new , or maybe one should say , post industrial revolution - the development of a low carbon economy , " he told journalists .
" we have already left behind our coal-based industrial past , it is time to embrace our low carbon future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's worried about the reliability of russian gas the plan is being published after a year of concern over the reliability of supplies from russia , in the forefront again over renewed tension between belarus and moscow that has disrupted the flow of oil to western europe . it also follows months of attempts in europe , notably sparked by takeover moves in france and spain , to put national energy interests before the spirit of a common eu approach . splitting up businesses ? the commission 's proposals hold that a delicate overall balance in energy policy can be achieved with firm commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 and to lift the use of renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could companies stop investing in power grids if the eu threatens to take them away ?
at the same time , big integrated energy groups could be required to " unbundle " some of their activities , such as splitting off power grids , to avoid conflicts of interests and fuel new competition in markets the commission finds too cozy for industry . separately , the commission found after a probe of more than 18 months that the energy market in the eu was too concentrated in the hands of companies that controlled supply , generation and infrastructure , stifling competition from newcomers . germany 's federation of gas and water suppliers criticized ideas to split up energy companies , saying that such a move would practically mean disowning companies . a federation official added that as a result , companies could also stop investing in power grids if they had to fear losing them later on . boosting nuclear power ? the commission also wants to bolster europe 's commitment to fighting climate change , in particular by proposing a target to limit emissions by 2020 after current ceilings under the kyoto protocol run out in 2012 . barroso called on the eu to commit to a reduction of " at least 20 percent " by 2020 from 1990 levels . under the kyoto protocol , developed countries are supposed to reduce their emissions by 5 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels and the eu has a higher target of 8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have decided to phase out nuclear energy to achieve that goal , the eu commission also calls for the promotion of nuclear energy , which is being phased out by several countries , including germany . while saying that it was up to each member state to decide , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that nuclear power generates energy with nearly no production of greenhouse gases .
he added that the commission wanted to " encourage debate " about the issue by " putting the facts on the table . " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile said the eu should not bank on nuclear power . " if they put excessive emphasis on atomic energy in their energy policy , then we 'll have a debate with the commission , " gabriel told germany 's ard public television on wednesday . eu leaders will decide the commission 's plans will be submitted to eu heads of state and government at a march summit with a view to forge a broad-ranging common energy policy . until now energy policy has been largely conducted along national lines , but recent oil price jumps and disruptions of russian gas supplies last year have focused leaders ' minds on an ambitious joint eu approach . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu study warns of catastrophe if global warming not curbed an eu study on climate change to be released wednesday has warned of drought-like conditions , catastrophic damage to business and tens of thousands of dead if urgent steps are n't taken to check global warming .

the welsh affairs select committee wants to quiz burberry managers as part of its inquiry into globalisation .
about 300 jobs will go when the firm closes the plant in march and moves its polo shirt production to china .
it says the site is not " commercially viable " .
the closure will go ahead despite a long campaign to save the factory .
no date has been fixed for the meeting between mps and burberry managers as the company has yet to be approached by committee officials .
the company announced in september last year that it was looking at proposals to move production abroad .
a consultation period on the move ended last week .
the mps ' intention to grill senior executives of the company emerged last month in a letter from committee chairman hywel francis to rhondda am leighton andrews .
emma thompson is the latest star to back burberry factory workers mr andrews and the area 's mp , chris bryant , have been working with the gmb union in the anti-closure fight .
workers picketed burberry 's flagship stores in new bond street and regent street in october .
double oscar winner emma thompson has become the latest celebrity to back the campaign .
the star of sense and sensibility and howard 's end joins fellow actors rhys ifans , ioan gruffudd and opera star bryn terfel in criticising the firm to ending its production in wales .
' unethical ' in a statement , ms thompson warned that burberry would appear " inauthentic " if it exported jobs abroad .
in a statement , she said : " when i buy clothes , i always check to see where they are made .
" when an item that is so clearly branded as british -lrb- to the core -rrb- is ' ' made in china ' , i 'm afraid that i often put that article straight back , suspecting corporate greed and unacceptably low wage packets for the producers of that article .
" burberry should not make this move - it will brand itself as greedy , unethical and - perhaps most importantly for the profile of the company - inauthentic . "
the workers from the treorchy factory currently make up a third of burberry 's 900-strong manufacturing workforce in britain .
burberry has since said it does not intend to abandon the uk and has offered welsh staff work at its site in yorkshire .

the welsh affairs select committee wants to quiz burberry managers as part of its inquiry into globalisation .
about 300 jobs will go when the firm closes the plant in march and moves its polo shirt production to china .
it says the site is not " commercially viable " .
the closure will go ahead despite a long campaign to save the factory .
no date has been fixed for the meeting between mps and burberry managers as the company has yet to be approached by committee officials .
the company announced in september last year that it was looking at proposals to move production abroad .
a consultation period on the move ended last week .
the mps ' intention to grill senior executives of the company emerged last month in a letter from committee chairman hywel francis to rhondda am leighton andrews .
emma thompson is the latest star to back burberry factory workers mr andrews and the area 's mp , chris bryant , have been working with the gmb union in the anti-closure fight .
workers picketed burberry 's flagship stores in new bond street and regent street in october .
double oscar winner emma thompson has become the latest celebrity to back the campaign .
the star of sense and sensibility and howard 's end joins fellow actors rhys ifans , ioan gruffudd and opera star bryn terfel in criticising the firm to ending its production in wales .
' unethical ' in a statement , ms thompson warned that burberry would appear " inauthentic " if it exported jobs abroad .
in a statement , she said : " when i buy clothes , i always check to see where they are made .
" when an item that is so clearly branded as british -lrb- to the core -rrb- is ' ' made in china ' , i 'm afraid that i often put that article straight back , suspecting corporate greed and unacceptably low wage packets for the producers of that article .
" burberry should not make this move - it will brand itself as greedy , unethical and - perhaps most importantly for the profile of the company - inauthentic . "
the workers from the treorchy factory currently make up a third of burberry 's 900-strong manufacturing workforce in britain .

oceanographic equipment is being used to determine whether metal objects found off the west coast of sulawesi are from the wreckage of the airliner .
but because of the depth at which the objects were found , experts admit they face a difficult task .
the adam air boeing 737-400 disappeared from radar screens last monday , carrying 102 people .
it had been flying from java to the northern sulawesi town of manado , and while the pilot had been forced to reroute several times due to bad weather , he did not report any technical difficulties .
sonar technology a massive air , land and sea operation has been under way ever since the plane went missing , with several other countries offering to help in the search .
bad weather has hampered the hunt , as have false leads .
government officials had to apologise soon after the plane 's disappearance for erroneously saying that the wreckage had been found .
since monday , the search has focused off the coast of western sulawesi , on the advice of a local fisherman , who reported seen a low-flying , unstable plane in the area .
an indonesian vessel then reported detecting large pieces of metal on the seabed , and the us navy ship mary sears was called in , because of its specialist sonar and satellite imagery equipment .
" the -lrb- usns -rrb- mary sears has a multi-signal device .
it can receive a lot of signals at one time so that it can figure out the silhouette of the objects , " said first air marshal eddy suyanto , the indonesian air base commander co-ordinating the search .
but he told reuters news agency that the depth of the objects - about 1,000m -lrb- 1,150 yards -rrb- - might present problems .
meanwhile other air , land and sea searches are continuing around sulawesi , but no other sightings have been recorded .

a challenge led by lord morrow of the democratic unionist party failed by a margin of three to one .
he had argued that the rules forced people to choose between obedience to god and obedience to the state .
but northern ireland minister lord rooker said it would be " quite wrong " to elevate the rights of one group above those of another .
demonstration lord morrow 's call to annul the regulations , which have applied in northern ireland since 1 january and are due to be implemented across the uk by april , was defeated by 199 votes to 68 .
the sexual orientation regulations have been criticised by some religious groups who say people will not be allowed to act according to faith .
christians ... can not and must not be forced to actively condone and promote sexual practices which the bible teaches are wrong thomas cordrey lawyer 's christian fellowship head-to-head : gay rights have your say hundreds of christians demonstrated outside parliament , but gay rights groups say no mainstream religious groups supported the protest .
critics say the new rules mean hotels can not refuse to provide rooms for gay couples , and religious groups would be obliged to rent out halls for " gay wedding " receptions .
they also argue a christian , jewish or muslim printer could be forced to print a flyer for a gay night club , or a teacher would have to break the law to promote heterosexual marriage over homosexual civil partnership .
tory peers were allowed a free vote but the liberal democrats supported the government , whose labour supporters were whipped to attend and vote .
' obedience ' lord morrow told peers : " the regulations make it possible for homosexual activists to sue people who disagree with a homosexual lifestyle because of their religious beliefs .
" they require religious organisations to choose between obedience to god and obedience to the state . "
he added : " the regulations threaten to override the conscience and free speech of christians and others who object to homosexual practice . "
conservative lord tebbit said : " black is about being .
sexual orientation is about being .
" and we would not wish to discriminate against people for being black nor on grounds of their sexual orientation .
" the concerns which are being expressed this evening are primarily about sodomy rather than about sexual orientation - that is doing , not being . "
but labour 's lord smith said : " i am somewhat puzzled by the arguments that have been advanced .
" it seems to me , in my simplistic way , that what they -lrb- the opponents of the regulations -rrb- are arguing for is quite simply the right to discriminate and the right to harass .
" and those arguments are being made in the name of christianity . "
' fence in behaviour ' one of those taking part in the demonstration outside parliament , ralph brockman , a baptist from london , told the bbc : " i 'm concerned that the biblical laws should be upheld .
" people may have different orientations but we need to have laws that will fence in our behaviour , as it were . "
john studley , a christian from london , said : " this government is placing sexual rights over religious rights . "
but neil partridge , a gay christian man , said : " everyone has a right to their faith but is it fair to say to someone ' you ca n't share a bed in our hotel because you are gay ' .
" a hotel is a business , surely .
i just think some of the people at this demonstration need to listen to the other side of the argument . "
he added : " recently british airways was criticised for not allowing staff to wear crucifixes and now some christians are advocating this policy .
i think the recent law is a good thing . "
supporters of the regulations say they simply extend to gay people the same rights that had been granted to people of different faiths in 1998 .
a high court judicial review against the regulations in northern ireland , brought by the christian institute , will be heard in march .

a challenge led by lord morrow of the democratic unionist party failed by a margin of three to one .
he had argued that the rules forced people to choose between obedience to god and obedience to the state .
but northern ireland minister lord rooker said it would be " quite wrong " to elevate the rights of one group above those of another .
demonstration lord morrow 's call to annul the regulations , which have applied in northern ireland since 1 january and are due to be implemented across the uk by april , was defeated by 199 votes to 68 .
the sexual orientation regulations have been criticised by some religious groups who say people will not be allowed to act according to faith . "
christians ... can not and must not be forced to actively condone and promote sexual practices which the bible teaches are wrong " thomas cordrey lawyer 's christian fellowship head-to-head : gay rights have your say hundreds of christians demonstrated outside parliament , but gay rights groups say no mainstream religious groups supported the protest .
critics say the new rules mean hotels can not refuse to provide rooms for gay couples , and religious groups would be obliged to rent out halls for " gay wedding " receptions .
they also argue a christian , jewish or muslim printer could be forced to print a flyer for a gay night club , or a teacher would have to break the law to promote heterosexual marriage over homosexual civil partnership .
tory peers were allowed a free vote but the liberal democrats supported the government , whose labour supporters were whipped to attend and vote .
' obedience ' lord morrow told peers : " the regulations make it possible for homosexual activists to sue people who disagree with a homosexual lifestyle because of their religious beliefs .
" they require religious organisations to choose between obedience to god and obedience to the state . "
he added : " the regulations threaten to override the conscience and free speech of christians and others who object to homosexual practice . "
conservative lord tebbit said : " black is about being .
sexual orientation is about being .

the " penetrators " would yield new information about the rocky interior .
the venture has been considered by britain 's astronomy funding agency , pparc , and has been presented to european partners .
the concept is the work of a consortium of space interests , including surrey satellite technology limited -lrb- sstl -rrb- .
sstl 's founder and chief executive , professor sir martin sweeting , says the costs of space exploration have fallen sufficiently for the uk to think about leading such a mission , which could be at the moon by 2010 .
inside the moon the consortium proposed two lunar options .
there have been 12 astronauts on the moon and more than 40 unmanned probes and yet we know surprisingly little about our nearest neighbour dr andrew coates , mullard space science lab the first , named moonlite , would despatch four suitcase-sized darts on to the lunar surface from orbit .
the darts would be sent into craters across a wide area .
they would hit the ground at a high velocity -lrb- 300m / s -rrb- and penetrate to a depth of 2m -lrb- 6ft -rrb- .
the darts could carry a small suite of instruments , such as seismometers to listen for " moonquakes " .
analysing these tremors would give scientists new insight into the make-up of the lunar interior .
according to dr andrew coates , of the mullard space science lab and who has contributed to the concept study , the impactors would represent the first time there had been a detailed study of the moon 's sub-surface .
moonraker would attempt to land on the lunar surface " there have been 12 astronauts on the moon and more than 40 unmanned probes and yet we know surprisingly little about our nearest neighbour , " he said .
" previous missions have focussed on the side of the moon that faces the earth .
our plan with moonlite is for the first time is to explore the mysterious far side of the moon as well . "
as well as moonlite , the consortium proposed another mission called moonraker .
this is designed to land on the lunar surface .
its scientific goal would be to study the lunar surface , perhaps at the poles or in the giant impact crater that resides on the far side of the moon .
it might also provide useful information for space agencies searching for suitable sites for eventual human habitation .
economic gain britain 's involvement in space has been as a partner in co-operation with nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- ; and that is unlikely to change .
but sir martin feels the time is now right for the uk to try to push its ideas to the fore ; it should try to lead these types of missions .
" for the first time , it 's now affordable , " he told bbc news .
" current small missions to the moon cost about 500 million euros .
with advances in small satellites , we could probably cut that cost . "
the missions would give uk scientists more opportunities to study the moon ; but , sir martin believes , they also present british industry with an incredible opportunity .
the americans intend to set up a lunar colony ; and the european , indian and chinese space agencies all have designs on the moon .
sir martin thinks a uk-led " moonshot " could provide the focus for british space companies to develop support technologies for what is rapidly turning into a 21st-century space race .
" in the uk , we have tremendous expertise in this area .
a uk moon programme would enable us to get a foothold in what could turn out to be an economically important area for a relatively low cost , " he argued .
sir martin thinks such a programme should be funded by industry and government .
he says that with sufficient support , a british conceived probe could be at the moon by the decade 's end .

there have been 12 astronauts on the moon and more than 40 unmanned probes and yet we know surprisingly little about our nearest neighbour " dr andrew coates , mullard space science lab the first , named moonlite , would despatch four suitcase-sized darts on to the lunar surface from orbit .
the darts would be sent into craters across a wide area .
they would hit the ground at a high velocity -lrb- 300m / s -rrb- and penetrate to a depth of 2m -lrb- 6ft -rrb- .
the darts could carry a small suite of instruments , such as seismometers to listen for " moonquakes " .
analysing these tremors would give scientists new insight into the make-up of the lunar interior .
according to dr andrew coates , of the mullard space science lab and who has contributed to the concept study , the impactors would represent the first time there had been a detailed study of the moon 's sub-surface .
" there have been 12 astronauts on the moon and more than 40 unmanned probes and yet we know surprisingly little about our nearest neighbour , " he said .
" previous missions have focussed on the side of the moon that faces the earth .
our plan with moonlite is for the first time is to explore the mysterious far side of the moon as well . "
as well as moonlite , the consortium proposed another mission called moonraker .
this is designed to land on the lunar surface .
its scientific goal would be to study the lunar surface , perhaps at the poles or in the giant impact crater that resides on the far side of the moon .
it might also provide useful information for space agencies searching for suitable sites for eventual human habitation .
economic gain britain 's involvement in space has been as a partner in co-operation with nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- ; and that is unlikely to change .
but sir martin feels the time is now right for the uk to try to push its ideas to the fore ; it should try to lead these types of missions .
" for the first time , it 's now affordable , " he told bbc news .
" current small missions to the moon cost about 500 million euros .
with advances in small satellites , we could probably cut that cost . "
the missions would give uk scientists more opportunities to study the moon ; but , sir martin believes , they also present british industry with an incredible opportunity .
the americans intend to set up a lunar colony ; and the european , indian and chinese space agencies all have designs on the moon .
sir martin thinks a uk-led " moonshot " could provide the focus for british space companies to develop support technologies for what is rapidly turning into a 21st-century space race .
" in the uk , we have tremendous expertise in this area .
a uk moon programme would enable us to get a foothold in what could turn out to be an economically important area for a relatively low cost , " he argued .
sir martin thinks such a programme should be funded by industry and government .
he says that with sufficient support , a british conceived probe could be at the moon by the decade 's end .

he said that olpc was ensuring that laptops were being deployed to areas where there was internet access .
" we are trying to help the governments - that ranges from donating resources , to making sure that we work with them and that they do n't consider the laptop as something that can work in a disconnected environment .

mr bletsas was speaking amidst the festival of consumerism taking place on the show floor of ces .

" they should look to connect the next five and a half billion .
" the way to do it is not to try and deploy tried and trusted technology but to try and develop technology specifically targeted to the developing world . "

mr bletsas was speaking amidst the festival of consumerism taking place on the show floor of ces .

" they should look to connect the next five and a half billion .
" the way to do it is not to try and deploy tried and trusted technology but to try and develop technology specifically targeted to the developing world . "
he said that olpc was ensuring that laptops were being deployed to areas where there was internet access .
" we are trying to help the governments - that ranges from donating resources , to making sure that we work with them and that they do n't consider the laptop as something that can work in a disconnected environment .
" it 's vitally important that children are connected .
my ambition is that we will get them connect to a vast amount of information that is unavailable to them .
" it will stimulate their interest in looking further - not waiting for some teacher or an adult . "

the last letter capt robert scott wrote to his wife , kathleen , reveals the human tragedy behind the doomed journey .
the letter was donated to the museum by his son 's widow capt scott 's realisation that he and his team were not going to survive their unsuccessful quest to become the first to reach the south pole is spelt out starkly in the opening line .
" to my widow , " he writes .
" we are in a very tight corner and i have doubts of pulling through . "
by the time he had started writing the letter - dated march 1912 and written over a period of days - plymouth-born capt scott and all his men were suffering from slow starvation and hypothermia .
weeks earlier on 17 january , in temperatures of -30c , they had been greeted at the south pole by the soul-destroying evidence that they had been beaten there by rival norwegian explorer roald amundsen .
from that point on , the team was engaged in a desperate struggle to reach a food and equipment supply depot which , because of blunders in an earlier preparatory mission , was further away from the south pole than planned .
' simply stop ' in the first instalment of the letter - written in his now-famous journal - capt scott tells his wife : " if anything happens to me i shall like you to know how much you have meant to me and that pleasant recollections are with me as i depart . "
quite the worst aspect of this situation is the thought that i shall not see you again capt scott in letter to his wife he also urges his wife to " take what comfort you can " that he would " leave the world fresh from harness and full of good health and vigour " .
" this is dictated already , " he continues referring to dwindling rations .
" when provisions come to an end we simply stop where we are . "
on 17 february , the expedition suffered its first casualty .
petty officer edgar evans died after he had stumbled behind the five-strong group and slipped into a coma .
and on 17 march - some time after capt scott had written the first instalment of his letter - another member of the group , capt lawrence " titus " oates , crippled with frostbite , famously walked out of the party 's tent to die telling the others : " i am just going outside and may be some time . "
in the second part of his letter to his wife , capt scott wrote that things " had gone down hill a good deal " since the first part of the letter .
" poor titus oates has gone - he was in a bad state - the rest of us keep going and imagine we have a chance to get through but the cold weather does n't let up at all . "
' worst aspect ' elsewhere in the letter , capt scott complains about the difficulty of writing " because of the cold - 70 degrees below zero and nothing but the shelter of our tent " .
scott letters go on display as well as speaking of his love for his wife - " quite the worst aspect of this situation is the thought that i shall not see you again " - capt scott also talks about his wishes for the future of his young son , peter , then aged three .
" it is a satisfaction to feel that he is safe with you , " he wrote .
" i think both he and you ought to be specially looked after by the country for which , after all , we have given our lives with something of spirit which makes for example . "
and later in the letter he urges his wife to " make the boy interested in natural history if you can - it is better than games " .
" try and make him believe in god , it is comforting , " he adds .
capt scott also tells his wife to " cherish no sentimental rubbish about remarriage " and to remarry " when the right man comes to help you in life " .
i think the best chance has gone capt scott in letter to his wife but the most poignant moment in the letter comes in the final entry .
" since writing the above we have got to within 11 miles of our depot with one hot meal and two days cold food and we should have got through but have been held for four days by a frightful storm , " he writes .
" i think the best chance has gone .
we have decided not to kill ourselves but to fight it to the last for that depot but in the fighting there is a painless end so do n't worry . "
with a swirling blizzard confining them to their sleeping bags in their tent , the three remaining men waited for the inevitable .
the final messages written by capt scott to his family will be on public display at the scott polar research institute museum in cambridge from 17 january .
they were donated to the museum by his son 's widow .

the last letter capt robert scott wrote to his wife , kathleen , reveals the human tragedy behind the doomed journey .
the letter was donated to the museum by his son 's widow capt scott 's realisation that he and his team were not going to survive their unsuccessful quest to become the first to reach the south pole is spelt out starkly in the opening line .
" to my widow , " he writes .
" we are in a very tight corner and i have doubts of pulling through . "
by the time he had started writing the letter - dated march 1912 and written over a period of days - plymouth-born capt scott and all his men were suffering from slow starvation and hypothermia .
weeks earlier on 17 january , in temperatures of -30c , they had been greeted at the south pole by the soul-destroying evidence that they had been beaten there by rival norwegian explorer roald amundsen .
from that point on , the team was engaged in a desperate struggle to reach a food and equipment supply depot which , because of blunders in an earlier preparatory mission , was further away from the south pole than planned .
' simply stop ' in the first instalment of the letter - written in his now-famous journal - capt scott tells his wife : " if anything happens to me i shall like you to know how much you have meant to me and that pleasant recollections are with me as i depart . "
quite the worst aspect of this situation is the thought that i shall not see you again capt scott in letter to his wife he also urges his wife to " take what comfort you can " that he would " leave the world fresh from harness and full of good health and vigour " .
" this is dictated already , " he continues referring to dwindling rations .
" when provisions come to an end we simply stop where we are . "
on 17 february , the expedition suffered its first casualty .
petty officer edgar evans died after he had stumbled behind the five-strong group and slipped into a coma .
and on 17 march - some time after capt scott had written the first instalment of his letter - another member of the group , capt lawrence " titus " oates , crippled with frostbite , famously walked out of the party 's tent to die telling the others : " i am just going outside and may be some time . "
in the second part of his letter to his wife , capt scott wrote that things " had gone down hill a good deal " since the first part of the letter .
" poor titus oates has gone - he was in a bad state - the rest of us keep going and imagine we have a chance to get through but the cold weather does n't let up at all . "
' worst aspect ' elsewhere in the letter , capt scott complains about the difficulty of writing " because of the cold - 70 degrees below zero and nothing but the shelter of our tent " .
scott letters go on display as well as speaking of his love for his wife - " quite the worst aspect of this situation is the thought that i shall not see you again " - capt scott also talks about his wishes for the future of his young son , peter , then aged three .
" it is a satisfaction to feel that he is safe with you , " he wrote .
" i think both he and you ought to be specially looked after by the country for which , after all , we have given our lives with something of spirit which makes for example . "
and later in the letter he urges his wife to " make the boy interested in natural history if you can - it is better than games " .
" try and make him believe in god , it is comforting , " he adds .
capt scott also tells his wife to " cherish no sentimental rubbish about remarriage " and to remarry " when the right man comes to help you in life " .
i think the best chance has gone capt scott in letter to his wife but the most poignant moment in the letter comes in the final entry .
" since writing the above we have got to within 11 miles of our depot with one hot meal and two days cold food and we should have got through but have been held for four days by a frightful storm , " he writes .
" i think the best chance has gone .
we have decided not to kill ourselves but to fight it to the last for that depot but in the fighting there is a painless end so do n't worry . "
with a swirling blizzard confining them to their sleeping bags in their tent , the three remaining men waited for the inevitable .
the final messages written by capt scott to his family will be on public display at the scott polar research institute museum in cambridge from 17 january .
they were donated to the museum by his son 's widow .

the last letter capt robert scott wrote to his wife , kathleen , reveals the human tragedy behind the doomed journey .
capt scott 's realisation that he and his team were not going to survive their unsuccessful quest to become the first to reach the south pole is spelt out starkly in the opening line .
" to my widow , " he writes .
" we are in a very tight corner and i have doubts of pulling through . "
by the time he had started writing the letter - dated march 1912 and written over a period of days - plymouth-born capt scott and all his men were suffering from slow starvation and hypothermia .
weeks earlier on 17 january , in temperatures of -30c , they had been greeted at the south pole by the soul-destroying evidence that they had been beaten there by rival norwegian explorer roald amundsen .
from that point on , the team was engaged in a desperate struggle to reach a food and equipment supply depot which , because of blunders in an earlier preparatory mission , was further away from the south pole than planned .
' simply stop ' in the first instalment of the letter - written in his now-famous journal - capt scott tells his wife : " if anything happens to me i shall like you to know how much you have meant to me and that pleasant recollections are with me as i depart . "
" quite the worst aspect of this situation is the thought that i shall not see you again " capt scott in letter to his wife he also urges his wife to " take what comfort you can " that he would " leave the world fresh from harness and full of good health and vigour " .
" this is dictated already , " he continues referring to dwindling rations .
" when provisions come to an end we simply stop where we are . "
on 17 february , the expedition suffered its first casualty .
petty officer edgar evans died after he had stumbled behind the five-strong group and slipped into a coma .
and on 17 march - some time after capt scott had written the first instalment of his letter - another member of the group , capt lawrence " titus " oates , crippled with frostbite , famously walked out of the party 's tent to die telling the others : " i am just going outside and may be some time . "
in the second part of his letter to his wife , capt scott wrote that things " had gone down hill a good deal " since the first part of the letter .
" poor titus oates has gone - he was in a bad state - the rest of us keep going and imagine we have a chance to get through but the cold weather does n't let up at all . "
' worst aspect ' elsewhere in the letter , capt scott complains about the difficulty of writing " because of the cold - 70 degrees below zero and nothing but the shelter of our tent " .
scott letters go on display as well as speaking of his love for his wife - " quite the worst aspect of this situation is the thought that i shall not see you again " - capt scott also talks about his wishes for the future of his young son , peter , then aged three .
" it is a satisfaction to feel that he is safe with you , " he wrote .
" i think both he and you ought to be specially looked after by the country for which , after all , we have given our lives with something of spirit which makes for example . "
and later in the letter he urges his wife to " make the boy interested in natural history if you can - it is better than games " .
" try and make him believe in god , it is comforting , " he adds .
capt scott also tells his wife to " cherish no sentimental rubbish about remarriage " and to remarry " when the right man comes to help you in life " . "
i think the best chance has gone " capt scott in letter to his wife but the most poignant moment in the letter comes in the final entry .
" since writing the above we have got to within 11 miles of our depot with one hot meal and two days cold food and we should have got through but have been held for four days by a frightful storm , " he writes .
" i think the best chance has gone .
we have decided not to kill ourselves but to fight it to the last for that depot but in the fighting there is a painless end so do n't worry . "
with a swirling blizzard confining them to their sleeping bags in their tent , the three remaining men waited for the inevitable .
the final messages written by capt scott to his family will be on public display at the scott polar research institute museum in cambridge from 17 january .
they were donated to the museum by his son 's widow .

scientists found that the number of sandeels available each spring for porpoises to eat has declined sharply , and more of the porpoises are starving .
the mammals need food frequently to survive , researchers say , and are vulnerable to shortfalls in their prey .
the problem , reported in the royal society 's journal biology letters , is also affecting some british sea birds .
sandeels are rich in oil , which make them a vital food for many birds and mammals . "
if they do n't get enough food , they die of hypothermia " colin macleod " the energy content per gram of tissue is the key factor , " observed colin macleod from aberdeen university .
" and harbour porpoises are quite small , so if they do n't get enough food , what happens is the blubber layer gets too thin and they die of hypothermia , " he told the bbc news website .
burrowed time the research shows that sandeels have been hard to find for harbour porpoises in the scottish north sea in recent years .
the team 's data comes from harbour porpoises which have been found dead on shore , and autopsied to determine the cause of death .
autopsies frequently include examination of stomach contents .
between the years of 1993 and 2001 , only 5 % of the animals dying in springtime died of starvation ; in 2002 and 2003 , the figure was 33 % .
the proportion of sandeels found in their stomachs declined sharply between the two periods .
in an average march between 1993 and 2001 , sandeels made up about 60 % of the average harbour porpoise 's diet ; in 2002 and 2003 , it was only 7 % .
the same trend has been seen for the month of may , though not april .
" the biology of sandeels is quite complicated , " said dr macleod .
" they spend a lot of the year including the winter buried in sand ; and what seems to be happening in recent years is that they are coming out of the sand into the water for much less of the time , and it 's only then that the porpoises can eat them . "
this behavioural change is believed to be linked to a loss of plankton , their key food , as seas warm , though overfishing is also a factor .
the sandeel decline has caused major problems for sea birds such as kittiwakes , arctic terns , guillemots and puffins , and fishing quotas have been cut drastically in an attempt to stem the tide .
the researchers observe that if water temperatures continue to rise and plankton decline accordingly , then a further reduction in the availability of sandeels can be expected .

the new admissions code , which applies to primary and secondary schools , bans them from assessing parents ' work , financial , marital or social status .
it gives schools the option to select by lottery if they want to take pupils who can not afford to live nearby .
the code comes into force next month , for admissions in september 2008 .
schools must now " act in accordance with " the code rather than merely having to " have regard to " the guidance .
the new regulations also prohibit schools from giving priority to children on the basis of their interests , knowledge or hobbies . "
this is a clear case of government over-regulation of schools " martin ward , association of school and college leaders and there must be no priority for the children of parents who are able to support the school financially .
the rules also stop a school giving priority to pupils whose parents put it as their first choice .
the code permits popular schools to use random allocation - or drawing names out of a hat .
" random allocation can widen access to schools for those unable to afford to buy houses near to favoured schools and create greater social equity , " the code says .
uniforms schools must tackle covert selection on the basis of expensive school uniforms , by ensuring the uniform is widely available .
the new code allows priority to be given to the brothers and sisters of older children already at the school - including those that select up to 10 % of their intake on the basis of ability .
however these schools - 36 in total - must ensure that local children will not lose out as a result of them offering a sibling priority .
and it says parents should know the outcome of selection tests such as the 11-plus before they make their school choices - a complete reversal of the previous policy .
there is also a requirement for schools and local authorities to have arrangements for children who need a school place outside the usual admissions round , such as the children of service personnel .
' fair opportunity ' the education secretary , alan johnson , said : " the code creates a system where all children , regardless of their background , have a fair opportunity of gaining a place at the school they want to attend .
" we want to put families at the centre of the decision making process around their children 's future . "
but the association of school and college leaders accused the government of creating an " unnecessarily bureaucratic " admissions system .
" the code itself runs to 112 pages , most of which say " must " and " must not " in bright red several times to schools and local authorities .
" and the documentation on the appeals process is yet to be added , " said deputy general secretary martin ward .
" this is a clear case of government over-regulation of schools .
" parents are also likely to find the code confusing and frustrating , " he added .
the nasuwt teachers ' union welcomed the new code , saying it should " secure more clarity , fairness and equity " .
general secretary chris keates said : " the outlawing of the process of interviewing parents and pupils , an invidious form of selection which was creeping into some schools , is particularly important .
" however , the new code does not address the practice of permitting some schools to select up to 10 % of their intake on the basis of the vague criterion of ' aptitude ' .
" nasuwt would have preferred to see this provision scrapped entirely . "

" however , the new code does not address the practice of permitting some schools to select up to 10 % of their intake on the basis of the vague criterion of ' aptitude ' .
" nasuwt would have preferred to see this provision scrapped entirely . "

the chain , which late last year celebrated a return to profit as part of its recovery , saw sales up 6.3 % on a year ago in the six weeks to 7 january .
it also said it that the number of products it had been forced to throw away or reduce in price was 20 % lower .
