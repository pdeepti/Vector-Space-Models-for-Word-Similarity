" the eu opposes capital punishment under all circumstances . " hangings soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's widely-publicized execution was criticized in europe the iraqi government on thursday postponed the execution of tikriti , saddam 's half brother and former intelligence chief , and bandar , the head of a revolutionary court , amid international criticism over the handling of saddam 's hanging last saturday . it did not set a precise date but the hangings are now expected to take place shortly after the end of state holidays for the eid al-adha festival on saturday . the eu said tikriti and bandar were part of a regime that had " brutally oppressed its own population for decades " and whose members must be brought to justice . it added however that for the sake of reconciliation and peace in iraq " the prosecution of those crimes must adhere to the requirements of a fair process . " eu body calls on iraq to halt executions the council of europe , a pan-european human rights watchdog body , appealed friday to iraq to immediately stop all executions , describing the death penalty as a human rights violation . " we express our solidarity with the iraqi people and reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the crimes committed by the regime of saddam hussein , " said a statement by the 46-member strasbourg-based forum linking nations in east and west europe .
" but we also call for an immediate end of executions and the abolition of the death penalty in iraq , " it urged . " the message to our friends in iraq is based on our own experience in europe ; namely that the death penalty violates human rights , and that without human rights there can be no justice , peace and reconciliation . " the council of europe is an international organization covering the european region , including russia and extending to azerbaijan , armenia , turkey , georgia and cyprus . it is not to be confused with the council of the european union or the european council , as it is a separate organisation and not part of the european union . hunger strike saddam 's hanging last week sparked outrage among sunni muslims for taking place on the first day of an important muslim holidays , and for a video released afterward that showed he was taunted and mocked as he stood on the gallows . us president george w. bush has said the execution should have occurred " in a more dignified way " and called on iraq to fully investigate what happened during the hanging . meanwhile , the head of italy 's libertarian radical party was hospitalized thursday on the ninth day of a hunger strike to urge a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian radical party leader marco pannella is on a hunger strike marco pannella , 76 , agreed to the move as doctors said that although he began accepting water on wednesday , his kidney function was deteriorating dangerously , a party spokesman told afp . not just condemnation the hunger strike follows an announcement tuesday by prime minister romano prodi to use italy 's position as a non-permanent member of the un security council for the next two years , to push for a global moratorium on the death penalty . the initiative was decided after the execution of saddam hussein . " on the un security council italy will act to ensure that the scrapping of the death penalty spreads and is applied in all countries the world over , " prodi told radio 1 .
" it is a difficult undertaking , but with time we will manage it .
the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act . " the italian political class was unanimous in its revulsion over saddam 's execution , with former prime minister silvio berlusconi calling it a " political and historic error . " rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , the prime minister said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy calls for united european front against death penalty europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning .

it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .

11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?
germany 's family affairs minister has said she 's confident a new government-funded parents ' support program will result in germans having more children and help reverse the steep decline in the nation 's birth rate .

at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .

the increasing disparity between rich and poor , as well as diminishing family structures , are to blame . germany is one of the wealthiest countries in europe .
yet thousands of children are living on the streets , according to the children 's relief organization terre des hommes -lrb- tdh -rrb- . " we have observed this development in germany for the past 10 years , " tdh director peter mucke told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung on thursday .
" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .
this was already the case in many developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations like the lindenhaus in dresden give shelter to homeless youth " there , the rich often live completely insulated from the poor , " mucke said .

the terre des hommes movement was started in switzerland in 1960 . " the images of the war in vietnam robbed us of our sleep , " said founding member lutz beisel .
" we wanted to help quickly and found doctors , hospitals and foster parents to take care of these children . "
the initiative brought vietnamese children to germany for treatment . today , tdh germany supports around 500 projects in 25 countries in africa , asia , latin america and germany .
in 2005 , it received 25.9 million euros -lrb- $ 33.9 million -rrb- in donations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than 10 million germans threatened by poverty charity associations are demanding that unemployment benefits be raised after the federal statistics office announced that 13 percent of germans are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to unemployment .

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

" there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .

the increasing disparity between rich and poor , as well as diminishing family structures , are to blame . germany is one of the wealthiest countries in europe .
yet thousands of children are living on the streets , according to the children 's relief organization terre des hommes -lrb- tdh -rrb- . " we have observed this development in germany for the past 10 years , " tdh director peter mucke told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung on thursday .
" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .
this was already the case in many developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations like the lindenhaus in dresden give shelter to homeless youth " there , the rich often live completely insulated from the poor , " mucke said .
" this results in a downright break in society . " some 2.5 million children under the age of 18 live below the poverty line in germany , according to government figures .
the federal statistics office warned last month that a further 1.7 million children are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to their parents ' unemployment . helping children quickly osnabrück-based tdh germany celebrates its 40th anniversary on monday .
it was founded on jan .
8 , 1967 , to help children injured in the vietnam war .
the terre des hommes movement was started in switzerland in 1960 . " the images of the war in vietnam robbed us of our sleep , " said founding member lutz beisel .
" we wanted to help quickly and found doctors , hospitals and foster parents to take care of these children . "
the initiative brought vietnamese children to germany for treatment . today , tdh germany supports around 500 projects in 25 countries in africa , asia , latin america and germany .
in 2005 , it received 25.9 million euros -lrb- $ 33.9 million -rrb- in donations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than 10 million germans threatened by poverty charity associations are demanding that unemployment benefits be raised after the federal statistics office announced that 13 percent of germans are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to unemployment .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .
common position on kyoto on another front , bush said he saw " a chance now to put behind us the old , stale debates of the past " on climate change but offered no concessions to european critics of washington 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact , which aims to control greenhouse gases , by march .
germany would like the 27-nation bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " between the european union and the united states , i think there 's a wide scope for further talks on this , " merkel said , amid european frustration at a the us refusal to ratify the pact , which runs out in 2012 , or offer a viable alternative . bush said he hoped sudan would " make more progress " in allowing " not only security , but goods and supplies provided to the people " in its violence-wracked province of darfur . the us president also said it was important to " follow through " on a un security council resolution aiming to punish iran for not freezing sensitive atomic activities that could fuel nuclear bomb development . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks bush backing for mideast peace , closer trade ties german chancellor angela merkel flies to washington thursday to seek us president bush 's backing for a fresh middle east peace drive and bolstered transatlantic economic ties under her eu presidency .

just how radical the path will be is still uncertain .
meanwhile , renewable energy use is up in germany . in an effort to increase competition in the energy market , reduce reliance on energy imports , and improve climate control , the european commission has drafted a two-sided plan to reform the energy sector . the commission wants to transform " europe into a highly efficient and low co2 energy economy by catalyzing a new industrial revolution , accelerating change to low carbon growth and , over the period of years , dramatically increasing the amount of local , low emission energy , " it said in a draft released thursday , as reported by reuters . two versions of the so-called " industrial revolution " have been outline and will be presented on wednesday , jan .
10 .
the more radical alternative , which has been rejected by german and french eu officials , involves dividing up energy corporations into producers and distributors .
this plan aims to break up powerful conglomerates like e.on , rwe in germany and edf in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants co2 emissions in 2050 to be half what they were in 1990 according to the milder version , an integrated model would be established , where the company would maintain ownership " of the network assets and receive a regulated return on them , " said the draft . differences of opinion among the member states have hindered a final decision on the eu 's energy reform path .
either way , modernizing the sector wo n't be cheap .
some 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- over the course of the next 25 years are necessary to update the infrastructure and meet increasing demand , said the commission . renewable energy gaining speed increased production and consumption of renewable energy is a significant part of modernizing the energy sector , an area in which germany seems to be showing an upward trend . production of renewable energy increased by 15.2 percent in 2006 , while consumption rose from 6.8 to 7.7 percent last year - the equivalent of 10 million households - according to a report by germany 's federation of renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- released thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel should use the eu presidency to promote renewable energy , some say " in 2006 we had the most growth we 've ever had , " bee director milan nitzschke told reporters thursday in berlin .
" we expect it to continue in 2007 . " solar energy remains the least common of renewable energy sources , yet at 30 percent saw the largest increase in 2006 .
use of bio-energy and wind power jumped 20 and 10 percent respectively . germany aims to increase renewable energy consumption to 85 percent by 2050 . " the goal is still to become independent of fossil fuels , like oil and petrol , and to introduce natural gas , " said bee president johannes lackmann . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

the increasing disparity between rich and poor , as well as diminishing family structures , are to blame . germany is one of the wealthiest countries in europe .
yet thousands of children are living on the streets , according to the children 's relief organization terre des hommes -lrb- tdh -rrb- . " we have observed this development in germany for the past 10 years , " tdh director peter mucke told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung on thursday .
" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .
this was already the case in many developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations like the lindenhaus in dresden give shelter to homeless youth " there , the rich often live completely insulated from the poor , " mucke said .
" this results in a downright break in society . " some 2.5 million children under the age of 18 live below the poverty line in germany , according to government figures .
the federal statistics office warned last month that a further 1.7 million children are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to their parents ' unemployment . helping children quickly osnabrück-based tdh germany celebrates its 40th anniversary on monday .
it was founded on jan .
8 , 1967 , to help children injured in the vietnam war .
the terre des hommes movement was started in switzerland in 1960 . " the images of the war in vietnam robbed us of our sleep , " said founding member lutz beisel .
" we wanted to help quickly and found doctors , hospitals and foster parents to take care of these children . "
the initiative brought vietnamese children to germany for treatment . today , tdh germany supports around 500 projects in 25 countries in africa , asia , latin america and germany .
in 2005 , it received 25.9 million euros -lrb- $ 33.9 million -rrb- in donations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than 10 million germans threatened by poverty charity associations are demanding that unemployment benefits be raised after the federal statistics office announced that 13 percent of germans are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to unemployment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.01.2007 food crunch as german appetite for organic products grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certification that food is organically produced is increasingly important to germans germans are increasingly opting for organic food .
so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .

the increasing disparity between rich and poor , as well as diminishing family structures , are to blame . germany is one of the wealthiest countries in europe .
yet thousands of children are living on the streets , according to the children 's relief organization terre des hommes -lrb- tdh -rrb- . " we have observed this development in germany for the past 10 years , " tdh director peter mucke told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung on thursday .
" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .

" the eu opposes capital punishment under all circumstances . " hangings soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's widely-publicized execution was criticized in europe the iraqi government on thursday postponed the execution of tikriti , saddam 's half brother and former intelligence chief , and bandar , the head of a revolutionary court , amid international criticism over the handling of saddam 's hanging last saturday . it did not set a precise date but the hangings are now expected to take place shortly after the end of state holidays for the eid al-adha festival on saturday . the eu said tikriti and bandar were part of a regime that had " brutally oppressed its own population for decades " and whose members must be brought to justice . it added however that for the sake of reconciliation and peace in iraq " the prosecution of those crimes must adhere to the requirements of a fair process . " eu body calls on iraq to halt executions the council of europe , a pan-european human rights watchdog body , appealed friday to iraq to immediately stop all executions , describing the death penalty as a human rights violation . " we express our solidarity with the iraqi people and reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the crimes committed by the regime of saddam hussein , " said a statement by the 46-member strasbourg-based forum linking nations in east and west europe .
" but we also call for an immediate end of executions and the abolition of the death penalty in iraq , " it urged . " the message to our friends in iraq is based on our own experience in europe ; namely that the death penalty violates human rights , and that without human rights there can be no justice , peace and reconciliation . " the council of europe is an international organization covering the european region , including russia and extending to azerbaijan , armenia , turkey , georgia and cyprus . it is not to be confused with the council of the european union or the european council , as it is a separate organisation and not part of the european union . hunger strike saddam 's hanging last week sparked outrage among sunni muslims for taking place on the first day of an important muslim holidays , and for a video released afterward that showed he was taunted and mocked as he stood on the gallows . us president george w. bush has said the execution should have occurred " in a more dignified way " and called on iraq to fully investigate what happened during the hanging . meanwhile , the head of italy 's libertarian radical party was hospitalized thursday on the ninth day of a hunger strike to urge a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian radical party leader marco pannella is on a hunger strike marco pannella , 76 , agreed to the move as doctors said that although he began accepting water on wednesday , his kidney function was deteriorating dangerously , a party spokesman told afp . not just condemnation the hunger strike follows an announcement tuesday by prime minister romano prodi to use italy 's position as a non-permanent member of the un security council for the next two years , to push for a global moratorium on the death penalty . the initiative was decided after the execution of saddam hussein . " on the un security council italy will act to ensure that the scrapping of the death penalty spreads and is applied in all countries the world over , " prodi told radio 1 .
" it is a difficult undertaking , but with time we will manage it .
the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act . " the italian political class was unanimous in its revulsion over saddam 's execution , with former prime minister silvio berlusconi calling it a " political and historic error . " rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , the prime minister said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy calls for united european front against death penalty europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

" there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .
common position on kyoto on another front , bush said he saw " a chance now to put behind us the old , stale debates of the past " on climate change but offered no concessions to european critics of washington 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact , which aims to control greenhouse gases , by march .
germany would like the 27-nation bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " between the european union and the united states , i think there 's a wide scope for further talks on this , " merkel said , amid european frustration at a the us refusal to ratify the pact , which runs out in 2012 , or offer a viable alternative . bush said he hoped sudan would " make more progress " in allowing " not only security , but goods and supplies provided to the people " in its violence-wracked province of darfur . the us president also said it was important to " follow through " on a un security council resolution aiming to punish iran for not freezing sensitive atomic activities that could fuel nuclear bomb development . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks bush backing for mideast peace , closer trade ties german chancellor angela merkel flies to washington thursday to seek us president bush 's backing for a fresh middle east peace drive and bolstered transatlantic economic ties under her eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.01.2007 food crunch as german appetite for organic products grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certification that food is organically produced is increasingly important to germans germans are increasingly opting for organic food .
so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff .

experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .
common position on kyoto on another front , bush said he saw " a chance now to put behind us the old , stale debates of the past " on climate change but offered no concessions to european critics of washington 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact , which aims to control greenhouse gases , by march .
germany would like the 27-nation bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " between the european union and the united states , i think there 's a wide scope for further talks on this , " merkel said , amid european frustration at a the us refusal to ratify the pact , which runs out in 2012 , or offer a viable alternative . bush said he hoped sudan would " make more progress " in allowing " not only security , but goods and supplies provided to the people " in its violence-wracked province of darfur . the us president also said it was important to " follow through " on a un security council resolution aiming to punish iran for not freezing sensitive atomic activities that could fuel nuclear bomb development . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks bush backing for mideast peace , closer trade ties german chancellor angela merkel flies to washington thursday to seek us president bush 's backing for a fresh middle east peace drive and bolstered transatlantic economic ties under her eu presidency .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .

" german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

" the eu opposes capital punishment under all circumstances . " hangings soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's widely-publicized execution was criticized in europe the iraqi government on thursday postponed the execution of tikriti , saddam 's half brother and former intelligence chief , and bandar , the head of a revolutionary court , amid international criticism over the handling of saddam 's hanging last saturday . it did not set a precise date but the hangings are now expected to take place shortly after the end of state holidays for the eid al-adha festival on saturday . the eu said tikriti and bandar were part of a regime that had " brutally oppressed its own population for decades " and whose members must be brought to justice . it added however that for the sake of reconciliation and peace in iraq " the prosecution of those crimes must adhere to the requirements of a fair process . " eu body calls on iraq to halt executions the council of europe , a pan-european human rights watchdog body , appealed friday to iraq to immediately stop all executions , describing the death penalty as a human rights violation . " we express our solidarity with the iraqi people and reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the crimes committed by the regime of saddam hussein , " said a statement by the 46-member strasbourg-based forum linking nations in east and west europe .
" but we also call for an immediate end of executions and the abolition of the death penalty in iraq , " it urged . " the message to our friends in iraq is based on our own experience in europe ; namely that the death penalty violates human rights , and that without human rights there can be no justice , peace and reconciliation . " the council of europe is an international organization covering the european region , including russia and extending to azerbaijan , armenia , turkey , georgia and cyprus . it is not to be confused with the council of the european union or the european council , as it is a separate organisation and not part of the european union . hunger strike saddam 's hanging last week sparked outrage among sunni muslims for taking place on the first day of an important muslim holidays , and for a video released afterward that showed he was taunted and mocked as he stood on the gallows . us president george w. bush has said the execution should have occurred " in a more dignified way " and called on iraq to fully investigate what happened during the hanging . meanwhile , the head of italy 's libertarian radical party was hospitalized thursday on the ninth day of a hunger strike to urge a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian radical party leader marco pannella is on a hunger strike marco pannella , 76 , agreed to the move as doctors said that although he began accepting water on wednesday , his kidney function was deteriorating dangerously , a party spokesman told afp . not just condemnation the hunger strike follows an announcement tuesday by prime minister romano prodi to use italy 's position as a non-permanent member of the un security council for the next two years , to push for a global moratorium on the death penalty . the initiative was decided after the execution of saddam hussein . " on the un security council italy will act to ensure that the scrapping of the death penalty spreads and is applied in all countries the world over , " prodi told radio 1 .
" it is a difficult undertaking , but with time we will manage it .
the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act . " the italian political class was unanimous in its revulsion over saddam 's execution , with former prime minister silvio berlusconi calling it a " political and historic error .

the increasing disparity between rich and poor , as well as diminishing family structures , are to blame . germany is one of the wealthiest countries in europe .
yet thousands of children are living on the streets , according to the children 's relief organization terre des hommes -lrb- tdh -rrb- . " we have observed this development in germany for the past 10 years , " tdh director peter mucke told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung on thursday .
" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .
this was already the case in many developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations like the lindenhaus in dresden give shelter to homeless youth " there , the rich often live completely insulated from the poor , " mucke said .
" this results in a downright break in society . " some 2.5 million children under the age of 18 live below the poverty line in germany , according to government figures .
the federal statistics office warned last month that a further 1.7 million children are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to their parents ' unemployment . helping children quickly osnabrück-based tdh germany celebrates its 40th anniversary on monday .
it was founded on jan .
8 , 1967 , to help children injured in the vietnam war .
the terre des hommes movement was started in switzerland in 1960 . " the images of the war in vietnam robbed us of our sleep , " said founding member lutz beisel .
" we wanted to help quickly and found doctors , hospitals and foster parents to take care of these children . "
the initiative brought vietnamese children to germany for treatment . today , tdh germany supports around 500 projects in 25 countries in africa , asia , latin america and germany .
in 2005 , it received 25.9 million euros -lrb- $ 33.9 million -rrb- in donations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than 10 million germans threatened by poverty charity associations are demanding that unemployment benefits be raised after the federal statistics office announced that 13 percent of germans are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to unemployment .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 05.01.2007 in surprise vote , potsdam decides to rebuild baroque palace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanssouci , another castle in potsdam , is popular among tourists in a referendum that defied the will of politicians and ignored empty state coffers , the people of potsdam , near berlin , have decided to rebuild an old prussian city palace . potsdamers this week stunned many in this historical town near berlin as they voted in a referendum to rebuild an old prussian palace that suffered huge damage in world war ii and under the communist rulers of former east germany . potsdam 's mayor jan jacobs said he was stunned by the huge voter turnout of almost 50 percent . " there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .

just how radical the path will be is still uncertain .
meanwhile , renewable energy use is up in germany . in an effort to increase competition in the energy market , reduce reliance on energy imports , and improve climate control , the european commission has drafted a two-sided plan to reform the energy sector . the commission wants to transform " europe into a highly efficient and low co2 energy economy by catalyzing a new industrial revolution , accelerating change to low carbon growth and , over the period of years , dramatically increasing the amount of local , low emission energy , " it said in a draft released thursday , as reported by reuters . two versions of the so-called " industrial revolution " have been outline and will be presented on wednesday , jan .

the more radical alternative , which has been rejected by german and french eu officials , involves dividing up energy corporations into producers and distributors .
this plan aims to break up powerful conglomerates like e.on , rwe in germany and edf in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants co2 emissions in 2050 to be half what they were in 1990 according to the milder version , an integrated model would be established , where the company would maintain ownership " of the network assets and receive a regulated return on them , " said the draft . differences of opinion among the member states have hindered a final decision on the eu 's energy reform path .
either way , modernizing the sector wo n't be cheap .
some 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- over the course of the next 25 years are necessary to update the infrastructure and meet increasing demand , said the commission . renewable energy gaining speed increased production and consumption of renewable energy is a significant part of modernizing the energy sector , an area in which germany seems to be showing an upward trend . production of renewable energy increased by 15.2 percent in 2006 , while consumption rose from 6.8 to 7.7 percent last year - the equivalent of 10 million households - according to a report by germany 's federation of renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- released thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel should use the eu presidency to promote renewable energy , some say " in 2006 we had the most growth we 've ever had , " bee director milan nitzschke told reporters thursday in berlin .
" we expect it to continue in 2007 . " solar energy remains the least common of renewable energy sources , yet at 30 percent saw the largest increase in 2006 .
use of bio-energy and wind power jumped 20 and 10 percent respectively . germany aims to increase renewable energy consumption to 85 percent by 2050 . " the goal is still to become independent of fossil fuels , like oil and petrol , and to introduce natural gas , " said bee president johannes lackmann . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

" there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

the increasing disparity between rich and poor , as well as diminishing family structures , are to blame . germany is one of the wealthiest countries in europe .
yet thousands of children are living on the streets , according to the children 's relief organization terre des hommes -lrb- tdh -rrb- . " we have observed this development in germany for the past 10 years , " tdh director peter mucke told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung on thursday .
" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .
this was already the case in many developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations like the lindenhaus in dresden give shelter to homeless youth " there , the rich often live completely insulated from the poor , " mucke said .
" this results in a downright break in society . " some 2.5 million children under the age of 18 live below the poverty line in germany , according to government figures .

the terre des hommes movement was started in switzerland in 1960 . " the images of the war in vietnam robbed us of our sleep , " said founding member lutz beisel .
" we wanted to help quickly and found doctors , hospitals and foster parents to take care of these children . "
the initiative brought vietnamese children to germany for treatment . today , tdh germany supports around 500 projects in 25 countries in africa , asia , latin america and germany .
in 2005 , it received 25.9 million euros -lrb- $ 33.9 million -rrb- in donations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than 10 million germans threatened by poverty charity associations are demanding that unemployment benefits be raised after the federal statistics office announced that 13 percent of germans are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to unemployment .

germany would like the 27-nation bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " between the european union and the united states , i think there 's a wide scope for further talks on this , " merkel said , amid european frustration at a the us refusal to ratify the pact , which runs out in 2012 , or offer a viable alternative . bush said he hoped sudan would " make more progress " in allowing " not only security , but goods and supplies provided to the people " in its violence-wracked province of darfur . the us president also said it was important to " follow through " on a un security council resolution aiming to punish iran for not freezing sensitive atomic activities that could fuel nuclear bomb development . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks bush backing for mideast peace , closer trade ties german chancellor angela merkel flies to washington thursday to seek us president bush 's backing for a fresh middle east peace drive and bolstered transatlantic economic ties under her eu presidency .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 05.01.2007 new eu rules to make medication safer for kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that spoonful of medicine will soon become safer new eu rules require europe-based pharmaceutical companies to show that the drugs they bring to market are suitable for kids .
experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .

just how radical the path will be is still uncertain .
meanwhile , renewable energy use is up in germany . in an effort to increase competition in the energy market , reduce reliance on energy imports , and improve climate control , the european commission has drafted a two-sided plan to reform the energy sector . the commission wants to transform " europe into a highly efficient and low co2 energy economy by catalyzing a new industrial revolution , accelerating change to low carbon growth and , over the period of years , dramatically increasing the amount of local , low emission energy , " it said in a draft released thursday , as reported by reuters . two versions of the so-called " industrial revolution " have been outline and will be presented on wednesday , jan .

the more radical alternative , which has been rejected by german and french eu officials , involves dividing up energy corporations into producers and distributors .
this plan aims to break up powerful conglomerates like e.on , rwe in germany and edf in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants co2 emissions in 2050 to be half what they were in 1990 according to the milder version , an integrated model would be established , where the company would maintain ownership " of the network assets and receive a regulated return on them , " said the draft . differences of opinion among the member states have hindered a final decision on the eu 's energy reform path .
either way , modernizing the sector wo n't be cheap .
some 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- over the course of the next 25 years are necessary to update the infrastructure and meet increasing demand , said the commission . renewable energy gaining speed increased production and consumption of renewable energy is a significant part of modernizing the energy sector , an area in which germany seems to be showing an upward trend . production of renewable energy increased by 15.2 percent in 2006 , while consumption rose from 6.8 to 7.7 percent last year - the equivalent of 10 million households - according to a report by germany 's federation of renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- released thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel should use the eu presidency to promote renewable energy , some say " in 2006 we had the most growth we 've ever had , " bee director milan nitzschke told reporters thursday in berlin .
" we expect it to continue in 2007 . " solar energy remains the least common of renewable energy sources , yet at 30 percent saw the largest increase in 2006 .
use of bio-energy and wind power jumped 20 and 10 percent respectively . germany aims to increase renewable energy consumption to 85 percent by 2050 . " the goal is still to become independent of fossil fuels , like oil and petrol , and to introduce natural gas , " said bee president johannes lackmann . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .

11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .
german authorities said his close contacts to bin laden were insufficient to lead to charges under german law . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted terrorist appeals to germany 's highest court a man convicted of being a terrorist with ties to the sept .

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 05.01.2007 in surprise vote , potsdam decides to rebuild baroque palace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanssouci , another castle in potsdam , is popular among tourists in a referendum that defied the will of politicians and ignored empty state coffers , the people of potsdam , near berlin , have decided to rebuild an old prussian city palace . potsdamers this week stunned many in this historical town near berlin as they voted in a referendum to rebuild an old prussian palace that suffered huge damage in world war ii and under the communist rulers of former east germany . potsdam 's mayor jan jacobs said he was stunned by the huge voter turnout of almost 50 percent . " there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.01.2007 food crunch as german appetite for organic products grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certification that food is organically produced is increasingly important to germans germans are increasingly opting for organic food .
so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

" there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .
common position on kyoto on another front , bush said he saw " a chance now to put behind us the old , stale debates of the past " on climate change but offered no concessions to european critics of washington 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact , which aims to control greenhouse gases , by march .
germany would like the 27-nation bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " between the european union and the united states , i think there 's a wide scope for further talks on this , " merkel said , amid european frustration at a the us refusal to ratify the pact , which runs out in 2012 , or offer a viable alternative . bush said he hoped sudan would " make more progress " in allowing " not only security , but goods and supplies provided to the people " in its violence-wracked province of darfur . the us president also said it was important to " follow through " on a un security council resolution aiming to punish iran for not freezing sensitive atomic activities that could fuel nuclear bomb development . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks bush backing for mideast peace , closer trade ties german chancellor angela merkel flies to washington thursday to seek us president bush 's backing for a fresh middle east peace drive and bolstered transatlantic economic ties under her eu presidency .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .
german authorities said his close contacts to bin laden were insufficient to lead to charges under german law . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted terrorist appeals to germany 's highest court a man convicted of being a terrorist with ties to the sept .

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .

several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .
german authorities said his close contacts to bin laden were insufficient to lead to charges under german law . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted terrorist appeals to germany 's highest court a man convicted of being a terrorist with ties to the sept .

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

just how radical the path will be is still uncertain .
meanwhile , renewable energy use is up in germany . in an effort to increase competition in the energy market , reduce reliance on energy imports , and improve climate control , the european commission has drafted a two-sided plan to reform the energy sector . the commission wants to transform " europe into a highly efficient and low co2 energy economy by catalyzing a new industrial revolution , accelerating change to low carbon growth and , over the period of years , dramatically increasing the amount of local , low emission energy , " it said in a draft released thursday , as reported by reuters . two versions of the so-called " industrial revolution " have been outline and will be presented on wednesday , jan .
10 .
the more radical alternative , which has been rejected by german and french eu officials , involves dividing up energy corporations into producers and distributors .
this plan aims to break up powerful conglomerates like e.on , rwe in germany and edf in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants co2 emissions in 2050 to be half what they were in 1990 according to the milder version , an integrated model would be established , where the company would maintain ownership " of the network assets and receive a regulated return on them , " said the draft . differences of opinion among the member states have hindered a final decision on the eu 's energy reform path .
either way , modernizing the sector wo n't be cheap .
some 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- over the course of the next 25 years are necessary to update the infrastructure and meet increasing demand , said the commission . renewable energy gaining speed increased production and consumption of renewable energy is a significant part of modernizing the energy sector , an area in which germany seems to be showing an upward trend . production of renewable energy increased by 15.2 percent in 2006 , while consumption rose from 6.8 to 7.7 percent last year - the equivalent of 10 million households - according to a report by germany 's federation of renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- released thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel should use the eu presidency to promote renewable energy , some say " in 2006 we had the most growth we 've ever had , " bee director milan nitzschke told reporters thursday in berlin .
" we expect it to continue in 2007 . " solar energy remains the least common of renewable energy sources , yet at 30 percent saw the largest increase in 2006 .
use of bio-energy and wind power jumped 20 and 10 percent respectively . germany aims to increase renewable energy consumption to 85 percent by 2050 . " the goal is still to become independent of fossil fuels , like oil and petrol , and to introduce natural gas , " said bee president johannes lackmann . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff .

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .

" german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

" there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

" there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

" i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

just how radical the path will be is still uncertain .
meanwhile , renewable energy use is up in germany . in an effort to increase competition in the energy market , reduce reliance on energy imports , and improve climate control , the european commission has drafted a two-sided plan to reform the energy sector . the commission wants to transform " europe into a highly efficient and low co2 energy economy by catalyzing a new industrial revolution , accelerating change to low carbon growth and , over the period of years , dramatically increasing the amount of local , low emission energy , " it said in a draft released thursday , as reported by reuters . two versions of the so-called " industrial revolution " have been outline and will be presented on wednesday , jan .
10 .
the more radical alternative , which has been rejected by german and french eu officials , involves dividing up energy corporations into producers and distributors .
this plan aims to break up powerful conglomerates like e.on , rwe in germany and edf in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants co2 emissions in 2050 to be half what they were in 1990 according to the milder version , an integrated model would be established , where the company would maintain ownership " of the network assets and receive a regulated return on them , " said the draft . differences of opinion among the member states have hindered a final decision on the eu 's energy reform path .
either way , modernizing the sector wo n't be cheap .
some 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- over the course of the next 25 years are necessary to update the infrastructure and meet increasing demand , said the commission . renewable energy gaining speed increased production and consumption of renewable energy is a significant part of modernizing the energy sector , an area in which germany seems to be showing an upward trend . production of renewable energy increased by 15.2 percent in 2006 , while consumption rose from 6.8 to 7.7 percent last year - the equivalent of 10 million households - according to a report by germany 's federation of renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- released thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel should use the eu presidency to promote renewable energy , some say " in 2006 we had the most growth we 've ever had , " bee director milan nitzschke told reporters thursday in berlin .
" we expect it to continue in 2007 . " solar energy remains the least common of renewable energy sources , yet at 30 percent saw the largest increase in 2006 .
use of bio-energy and wind power jumped 20 and 10 percent respectively . germany aims to increase renewable energy consumption to 85 percent by 2050 . " the goal is still to become independent of fossil fuels , like oil and petrol , and to introduce natural gas , " said bee president johannes lackmann . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .

11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks .

" the eu opposes capital punishment under all circumstances . " hangings soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's widely-publicized execution was criticized in europe the iraqi government on thursday postponed the execution of tikriti , saddam 's half brother and former intelligence chief , and bandar , the head of a revolutionary court , amid international criticism over the handling of saddam 's hanging last saturday . it did not set a precise date but the hangings are now expected to take place shortly after the end of state holidays for the eid al-adha festival on saturday . the eu said tikriti and bandar were part of a regime that had " brutally oppressed its own population for decades " and whose members must be brought to justice . it added however that for the sake of reconciliation and peace in iraq " the prosecution of those crimes must adhere to the requirements of a fair process .

" we express our solidarity with the iraqi people and reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the crimes committed by the regime of saddam hussein , " said a statement by the 46-member strasbourg-based forum linking nations in east and west europe .
" but we also call for an immediate end of executions and the abolition of the death penalty in iraq , " it urged . " the message to our friends in iraq is based on our own experience in europe ; namely that the death penalty violates human rights , and that without human rights there can be no justice , peace and reconciliation . " the council of europe is an international organization covering the european region , including russia and extending to azerbaijan , armenia , turkey , georgia and cyprus . it is not to be confused with the council of the european union or the european council , as it is a separate organisation and not part of the european union . hunger strike saddam 's hanging last week sparked outrage among sunni muslims for taking place on the first day of an important muslim holidays , and for a video released afterward that showed he was taunted and mocked as he stood on the gallows . us president george w. bush has said the execution should have occurred " in a more dignified way " and called on iraq to fully investigate what happened during the hanging . meanwhile , the head of italy 's libertarian radical party was hospitalized thursday on the ninth day of a hunger strike to urge a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment .

" on the un security council italy will act to ensure that the scrapping of the death penalty spreads and is applied in all countries the world over , " prodi told radio 1 .
" it is a difficult undertaking , but with time we will manage it .
the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act . " the italian political class was unanimous in its revulsion over saddam 's execution , with former prime minister silvio berlusconi calling it a " political and historic error .

" the eu opposes capital punishment under all circumstances . " hangings soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's widely-publicized execution was criticized in europe the iraqi government on thursday postponed the execution of tikriti , saddam 's half brother and former intelligence chief , and bandar , the head of a revolutionary court , amid international criticism over the handling of saddam 's hanging last saturday . it did not set a precise date but the hangings are now expected to take place shortly after the end of state holidays for the eid al-adha festival on saturday . the eu said tikriti and bandar were part of a regime that had " brutally oppressed its own population for decades " and whose members must be brought to justice . it added however that for the sake of reconciliation and peace in iraq " the prosecution of those crimes must adhere to the requirements of a fair process . " eu body calls on iraq to halt executions the council of europe , a pan-european human rights watchdog body , appealed friday to iraq to immediately stop all executions , describing the death penalty as a human rights violation . " we express our solidarity with the iraqi people and reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the crimes committed by the regime of saddam hussein , " said a statement by the 46-member strasbourg-based forum linking nations in east and west europe .
" but we also call for an immediate end of executions and the abolition of the death penalty in iraq , " it urged . " the message to our friends in iraq is based on our own experience in europe ; namely that the death penalty violates human rights , and that without human rights there can be no justice , peace and reconciliation . " the council of europe is an international organization covering the european region , including russia and extending to azerbaijan , armenia , turkey , georgia and cyprus . it is not to be confused with the council of the european union or the european council , as it is a separate organisation and not part of the european union . hunger strike saddam 's hanging last week sparked outrage among sunni muslims for taking place on the first day of an important muslim holidays , and for a video released afterward that showed he was taunted and mocked as he stood on the gallows . us president george w. bush has said the execution should have occurred " in a more dignified way " and called on iraq to fully investigate what happened during the hanging . meanwhile , the head of italy 's libertarian radical party was hospitalized thursday on the ninth day of a hunger strike to urge a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian radical party leader marco pannella is on a hunger strike marco pannella , 76 , agreed to the move as doctors said that although he began accepting water on wednesday , his kidney function was deteriorating dangerously , a party spokesman told afp . not just condemnation the hunger strike follows an announcement tuesday by prime minister romano prodi to use italy 's position as a non-permanent member of the un security council for the next two years , to push for a global moratorium on the death penalty . the initiative was decided after the execution of saddam hussein . " on the un security council italy will act to ensure that the scrapping of the death penalty spreads and is applied in all countries the world over , " prodi told radio 1 .
" it is a difficult undertaking , but with time we will manage it .
the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act . " the italian political class was unanimous in its revulsion over saddam 's execution , with former prime minister silvio berlusconi calling it a " political and historic error . " rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , the prime minister said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy calls for united european front against death penalty europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.01.2007 food crunch as german appetite for organic products grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certification that food is organically produced is increasingly important to germans germans are increasingly opting for organic food .
so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .

at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .
it passed legislation for improving pediatric drugs through patent extension incentives 10 years ago .
at the time , us pharmaceuticals company eli lilly made an estimated $ 700 million in profit during those extra six months of marketing their anti-depressant prozac alone . pan-european clinical studies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids have a hard time swallowing capsules many european companies say they have shied away from pediatric testing until now because costs for developing and testing drugs for children have been too prohibitive and the market too small to make development worthwhile . though tests have been done for light medications like cough syrup for kids - which is easy to sell - other more serious diseases , such as cancer , require intensive research as well as enough participants to conduct clinical trials . the new eu regulations solve the problem by allowing drug companies to do clinical studies on a pan-european basis . " that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff .

so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .
german authorities said his close contacts to bin laden were insufficient to lead to charges under german law . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted terrorist appeals to germany 's highest court a man convicted of being a terrorist with ties to the sept .

but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .

11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .
german authorities said his close contacts to bin laden were insufficient to lead to charges under german law . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted terrorist appeals to germany 's highest court a man convicted of being a terrorist with ties to the sept .

just how radical the path will be is still uncertain .
meanwhile , renewable energy use is up in germany . in an effort to increase competition in the energy market , reduce reliance on energy imports , and improve climate control , the european commission has drafted a two-sided plan to reform the energy sector . the commission wants to transform " europe into a highly efficient and low co2 energy economy by catalyzing a new industrial revolution , accelerating change to low carbon growth and , over the period of years , dramatically increasing the amount of local , low emission energy , " it said in a draft released thursday , as reported by reuters . two versions of the so-called " industrial revolution " have been outline and will be presented on wednesday , jan .
10 .
the more radical alternative , which has been rejected by german and french eu officials , involves dividing up energy corporations into producers and distributors .
this plan aims to break up powerful conglomerates like e.on , rwe in germany and edf in france .

" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .
this was already the case in many developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations like the lindenhaus in dresden give shelter to homeless youth " there , the rich often live completely insulated from the poor , " mucke said .
" this results in a downright break in society . " some 2.5 million children under the age of 18 live below the poverty line in germany , according to government figures .

the terre des hommes movement was started in switzerland in 1960 . " the images of the war in vietnam robbed us of our sleep , " said founding member lutz beisel .
" we wanted to help quickly and found doctors , hospitals and foster parents to take care of these children . "
the initiative brought vietnamese children to germany for treatment . today , tdh germany supports around 500 projects in 25 countries in africa , asia , latin america and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.01.2007 food crunch as german appetite for organic products grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certification that food is organically produced is increasingly important to germans germans are increasingly opting for organic food .
so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .
german authorities said his close contacts to bin laden were insufficient to lead to charges under german law . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted terrorist appeals to germany 's highest court a man convicted of being a terrorist with ties to the sept .

" the council of europe is an international organization covering the european region , including russia and extending to azerbaijan , armenia , turkey , georgia and cyprus . it is not to be confused with the council of the european union or the european council , as it is a separate organisation and not part of the european union . hunger strike saddam 's hanging last week sparked outrage among sunni muslims for taking place on the first day of an important muslim holidays , and for a video released afterward that showed he was taunted and mocked as he stood on the gallows . us president george w. bush has said the execution should have occurred " in a more dignified way " and called on iraq to fully investigate what happened during the hanging . meanwhile , the head of italy 's libertarian radical party was hospitalized thursday on the ninth day of a hunger strike to urge a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment .

the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act . " the italian political class was unanimous in its revulsion over saddam 's execution , with former prime minister silvio berlusconi calling it a " political and historic error .

he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .

but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .

just how radical the path will be is still uncertain .
meanwhile , renewable energy use is up in germany . in an effort to increase competition in the energy market , reduce reliance on energy imports , and improve climate control , the european commission has drafted a two-sided plan to reform the energy sector . the commission wants to transform " europe into a highly efficient and low co2 energy economy by catalyzing a new industrial revolution , accelerating change to low carbon growth and , over the period of years , dramatically increasing the amount of local , low emission energy , " it said in a draft released thursday , as reported by reuters . two versions of the so-called " industrial revolution " have been outline and will be presented on wednesday , jan .

the more radical alternative , which has been rejected by german and french eu officials , involves dividing up energy corporations into producers and distributors .
this plan aims to break up powerful conglomerates like e.on , rwe in germany and edf in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants co2 emissions in 2050 to be half what they were in 1990 according to the milder version , an integrated model would be established , where the company would maintain ownership " of the network assets and receive a regulated return on them , " said the draft . differences of opinion among the member states have hindered a final decision on the eu 's energy reform path .
either way , modernizing the sector wo n't be cheap .
some 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- over the course of the next 25 years are necessary to update the infrastructure and meet increasing demand , said the commission . renewable energy gaining speed increased production and consumption of renewable energy is a significant part of modernizing the energy sector , an area in which germany seems to be showing an upward trend . production of renewable energy increased by 15.2 percent in 2006 , while consumption rose from 6.8 to 7.7 percent last year - the equivalent of 10 million households - according to a report by germany 's federation of renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- released thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel should use the eu presidency to promote renewable energy , some say " in 2006 we had the most growth we 've ever had , " bee director milan nitzschke told reporters thursday in berlin .
" we expect it to continue in 2007 . " solar energy remains the least common of renewable energy sources , yet at 30 percent saw the largest increase in 2006 .
use of bio-energy and wind power jumped 20 and 10 percent respectively . germany aims to increase renewable energy consumption to 85 percent by 2050 . " the goal is still to become independent of fossil fuels , like oil and petrol , and to introduce natural gas , " said bee president johannes lackmann . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

" the eu opposes capital punishment under all circumstances . " hangings soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's widely-publicized execution was criticized in europe the iraqi government on thursday postponed the execution of tikriti , saddam 's half brother and former intelligence chief , and bandar , the head of a revolutionary court , amid international criticism over the handling of saddam 's hanging last saturday . it did not set a precise date but the hangings are now expected to take place shortly after the end of state holidays for the eid al-adha festival on saturday . the eu said tikriti and bandar were part of a regime that had " brutally oppressed its own population for decades " and whose members must be brought to justice . it added however that for the sake of reconciliation and peace in iraq " the prosecution of those crimes must adhere to the requirements of a fair process . " eu body calls on iraq to halt executions the council of europe , a pan-european human rights watchdog body , appealed friday to iraq to immediately stop all executions , describing the death penalty as a human rights violation . " we express our solidarity with the iraqi people and reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the crimes committed by the regime of saddam hussein , " said a statement by the 46-member strasbourg-based forum linking nations in east and west europe .
" but we also call for an immediate end of executions and the abolition of the death penalty in iraq , " it urged . " the message to our friends in iraq is based on our own experience in europe ; namely that the death penalty violates human rights , and that without human rights there can be no justice , peace and reconciliation .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks .

she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .
common position on kyoto on another front , bush said he saw " a chance now to put behind us the old , stale debates of the past " on climate change but offered no concessions to european critics of washington 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact , which aims to control greenhouse gases , by march .
germany would like the 27-nation bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " between the european union and the united states , i think there 's a wide scope for further talks on this , " merkel said , amid european frustration at a the us refusal to ratify the pact , which runs out in 2012 , or offer a viable alternative . bush said he hoped sudan would " make more progress " in allowing " not only security , but goods and supplies provided to the people " in its violence-wracked province of darfur . the us president also said it was important to " follow through " on a un security council resolution aiming to punish iran for not freezing sensitive atomic activities that could fuel nuclear bomb development . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks bush backing for mideast peace , closer trade ties german chancellor angela merkel flies to washington thursday to seek us president bush 's backing for a fresh middle east peace drive and bolstered transatlantic economic ties under her eu presidency .

experts say it 's a huge step forward for children 's health . scary as it sounds , kids are often given medication that may not be good for them . " over 50 percent of the medication given to children is not approved for them , " according to kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . that means doctors often give drugs to young people that have not been tested in clinical trials on children , only on adults .
some doctors even estimate that up to 90 percent of drugs given to kids in intensive care units in germany have not been previously tested on minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller doses are not always enough all this is about to change thanks to eu guidelines that go into effect in january requiring pharmaceutical companies based in europe to prove that every new drug that comes on the market has undergone clinical trials on children .
for medication already on sale , drug firms will also be required to list dosage information for children and adolescents . the guidelines are supposed to spur drug companies to conduct more pediatric testing through incentives , while also taking pressure off doctors . hefty incentives for drug companies as an incentive , pharmaceutical companies can enjoy a six-month extension of their patents on drugs .
that continued marketing exclusivity can translate into big bucks for companies that outweigh the costs of experiments with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , only around 20 drugs are approved for kids annually in germany according to eu estimates , extended patents could translate into 800,000 to 9 million euros -lrb- $ 1.12 million -rrb- extra profit - depending on the drug - for pharmaceutical companies . the us has already led the way in the field .

" that 's essential because you need to get enough people together for a clinical study for it to be representative , " said siegfried throm of the german association of research-based pharmaceutical companies . rounding up several hundred children with cancer to participate in tests in germany is highly unlikely .
getting that number together across europe is more feasible . more child-friendly experts point out that the new eu rules on pediatric testing wo n't just lead to safer and better medication for kids , but will also ease the pressure on doctors who are often uneasy about prescribing drugs with unknown side effects . in addition , the new guidelines also take into account children 's special needs and make a clear distinction between adult and children 's medicine . often , medication is simply given to children in smaller doses - downsized according to a child 's weight as in the case of aspirin .
in some cases , though , they require greater amounts of certain drugs because their bodies process them faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll be a while before he can handle larger doses " children have entirely different metabolisms than adults , " said throm . no risk , no gain still , pediatric drug testing is not without risks .
there are also ethical issues to consider . children and teenagers are vulnerable and may not fully understand the possible consequences if they were to participate in experiments .
infants and toddlers can not give their consent , and few parents would subject their child to possibly severe side effects caused by drug experiments . " prudence is key as drug companies start to run more clinical trials on kids in the eu , " vogel said .
" researchers have to be very , very careful . " the emea , the eu 's pharmaceuticals regulatory agency , plans to establish a committee on pediatric medicines to oversee testing .
it will decide for which age groups pharmaceutical companies must develop drugs and conduct clinical trials . drugs for kids suffering from severe diseases , such as aids or cancer , are likely to be the first items on the agenda .
" it only makes sense to do testing on kids who are already sick and not on healthy ones , " said vogel . in the end , getting the right medicine at the right time in the right dosage could just be the light at the end of the tunnel for many sick kids . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best christmas gift for germany : more children ?

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .

" when we solve that problem , a lot of other problems will be easier to solve , " bush said after talks at the white house with merkel on thursday .
" i 'm optimistic that we can achieve that objective . " " condoleezza rice will be going to the middle east here shortly .
she 'll come back to report to not only me , but also to the chancellor about how we can move the process forward , " he said at a joint public appearance with merkel . germany has laid out an ambitious agenda , including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for middle east peace comprising the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations , at what it considers to be an auspicious time . " madam chancellor had a good idea to convene the quartet , which i agreed to .
i think the quartet ought to meet at an appropriate time , " said bush , whom critics accuse of neglecting the peace process in favor of the iraq war .
" i think this is the right point in time to take some time and reflect what the quartet can actually do in order to bring about a solution , " merkel said through an interpreter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should strengthen palestinian president abbas , merkel said merkel 's us visit , her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago , came after germany assumed the six-month presidency of the european union and the year-long leadership of the group of eight industrialized countries . moscow 's backing " we would like the european union to speak with one and the same voice , saying : ' we want a two-state solution .
we want the recognition of the state of israel by the palestinians .
we want to strengthen -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas , " ' she said . a german foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting " as soon as possible " and had already won russian support for the initiative . " we also want to strengthen , to bolster , the evolution of a strong lebanon .
we discussed this today , too , and we also discussed the measures that we think need to be taken , " said merkel . bush , who rejected calls to broaden the quartet 's mandate to issues like lebanon , said the key there was to move " as fast as possible " with the tribunal for the murder of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri in february 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was critical of german foreign minister steinmeier 's meeting with syrian president assad -lrb- l . -rrb- last month as he has in the context of iraq , bush rejected direct talks with syria , saying the syrians " can be a much more constructive partner , and they have n't been .
they do n't need to be told that in meeting after meeting after meeting . " merkel , who said the quartet already " has its work cut out for it " with the middle east peace process , declared that " syria needs to be given a push " on lebanon and that damascus had squandered chances to play a more positive role .
common position on kyoto on another front , bush said he saw " a chance now to put behind us the old , stale debates of the past " on climate change but offered no concessions to european critics of washington 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact , which aims to control greenhouse gases , by march .
germany would like the 27-nation bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " between the european union and the united states , i think there 's a wide scope for further talks on this , " merkel said , amid european frustration at a the us refusal to ratify the pact , which runs out in 2012 , or offer a viable alternative . bush said he hoped sudan would " make more progress " in allowing " not only security , but goods and supplies provided to the people " in its violence-wracked province of darfur . the us president also said it was important to " follow through " on a un security council resolution aiming to punish iran for not freezing sensitive atomic activities that could fuel nuclear bomb development . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks bush backing for mideast peace , closer trade ties german chancellor angela merkel flies to washington thursday to seek us president bush 's backing for a fresh middle east peace drive and bolstered transatlantic economic ties under her eu presidency .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

11 hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq has come to end of the legal road after two trials and two appeals mounir el motassadeq , the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , goes to court in hamburg on thursday .
he could be sentenced to 15 years in jail . security will be tight on thursday at the courthouse in hamburg where motassadeq , 32 , was convicted in 2005 on terrorism charges and sentenced to seven years in jail . a moroccan living in hamburg , motassadeq was part of a circle that included mohammed atta and two other hijackers who carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people .
in november , motassadeq was convicted on a further 246 counts of accessory to murder following an appeal . after two full-scale trials and two appeals , motassadeq will this time only face an abbreviated trial on five hearing days stretching into february to determine a suitable punishment for assisting the killings of the hijack victims . ladislav anisic , a lawyer representing motassadeq , has predicted that the trial will be quick . " they 'll be over and done with in three days , " he said . the hamburg judges , who do not have the power to question the conviction , are expected to increase the seven-year term . long-running legal saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed atta flew a passenger jet into the world trade center the long-running legal saga has hinged on how much motassadeq , who had been studying electrical engineering in germany , could have known about the plans of his friends , led by pilot atta , who crashed one passenger jet into the world trade center . the trial court ruled that motassadeq was part of the terrorist cell , and the appeal judges added that he must have known in advance that all the occupants of the four hijacked planes would be killed . only one other accessory to the attacks , zacarias moussaoui , also of moroccan descent , has been tried .
a us court sentenced him to life in jail in may last year .
several other alleged conspirators who were not among the 19 suicide attackers are still at large or in custody but have not yet been tried . how much did he know ? motassadeq 's odyssey through the courts began with his october 2001 arrest , after german police uncovered his association with atta .
he was given the maximum 15-year sentence in 2003 .
but that verdict was overturned in 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects in us custody . at a retrial which ended in august 2005 , the court found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in the attacks .
but he was found to have handled the hijackers ' bank transfers and to have covered up their whereabouts . much of the legal argument over his case was about whether in conversations with atta he could have foreseen the extraordinary damage the attacks could inflict , with two of the world 's highest buildings collapsing . later comments by al qaeda leader osama bin laden suggested that even the terrorist kingpin did not realize that the fires caused by the crashed jets would melt the steel frames of the world trade center towers in new york . motassadeq , who is married with at least one child , has spent long periods free on bail in hamburg , but was barred from resuming his studies .
german authorities plan to expel him after his jail term . germany grapples with legal challenges germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the hijackers were arab students who had been living in hamburg . despite those measures , german judges have not had an easy time interpreting the evidence and putting terror convicts behind bars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were allegedly plotted at marienstrasse in hamburg abdel-ghani mzoudi , another associate of the terrorists who lived in hamburg , was acquitted on similar evidence to that brought against motassadeq and subsequently went home to morocco .
both mzoudi and motassadeq were radical islamists who had trained in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , then returned to hamburg . german authorities gave up trying to imprison other associates .
an inquiry against mamoun darkanzali , a syrian-born hamburg trader , was abandoned last year for lack of evidence , though he knew the hamburg terrorist and had business dealings with bin laden 's group . another syrian-born man , mohammad haidar sammar , allegedly recruited the hamburg attackers to al qaeda .
german police questioned but did not arrest him .
he is now in syrian custody awaiting trial . christian ganczarski , a german who converted to islam , is currently in french custody .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.01.2007 food crunch as german appetite for organic products grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certification that food is organically produced is increasingly important to germans germans are increasingly opting for organic food .
so much so that that many supermarkets are unable to meet the demand and are forced to rely on foreign imports of foods and vegetables . organic supermarkets are booming in germany and a new store opens each week . surveys say that one in five consumers say certification that a food is organically produced is part of their decision to buy it .
conventional supermarkets have also begun to introduce an increasing amount of organic product lines to their usual selections .
last year , the sector had a turnover of around 4.5 billion euros . but many stores are having a hard time trying to keep up with the demand .
empty shelves and racks of organic fruits and vegetables are n't an uncommon sight in german supermarkets these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans would rather sink their teeth into organic produce pork , carrots , potatoes and oats are most in demand , antje kasbohm of the central agricultural market and pricing center gmbh -lrb- zmp -rrb- told german broadcaster ard . according to the zmp , sales of organic fruit to private households in germany rose by 69 percent in the first half of 2006 as compared to the same period in the previous year .
sales of organic vegetables increased by 17 percent . organic food stocks dwindling in europe many supermarkets who have expanded their organic food product lines at affordable prices in recent months are now scrambling to meet demand by relying on imports . but not even imported products from other european countries can meet consumer demand , said ulrich hamm , head of the department of agriculture and food marketing at the university of kassel . " oats are sold out all across europe , you ca n't buy eggs anywhere in germany and france , and no one knows how consumers are going to get potatoes from the middle of january on , " hamm told german news agency dpa .
organic vegetables , as well as poultry and pork were also difficult to purchase , he said . imports from argentina and south africa supermarkets in germany are now forced to rely on organic food imports from countries as far away as argentina , chile , canada and south africa .
experts stress that the quality of the products is not compromised despite the long transport routes because all foreign imports have to fulfill quality standards laid down in eu organic food guidelines . one of the major reasons for the current organic food crunch in germany is that subsidies for farmers to switch from conventional to organic farming have been cut in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farm near heidenheim in germany switched to organic farming years ago indeed , an increasing number of german states have slashed subsidies for farmers meant to help them tide over a three-year waiting period as they switch from conventional to organic farming . bärbel höhn , deputy head of the parliamentary group of the opposition green party told der spiegel that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats had " initiated a rollback in agricultural policy . " the german government however has argued that bad harvests for organic farmers were to blame for the current crunch in organic products . experts point out that given the organic sector 's huge potential , it 's still not too late for farmers to switch to organic farming . hamm said he still recommended the changeover to organic farming for german growers , even if they could only use the label " bio " three years later .
the trend for organic food was long-term , he said . germans more health-conscious indeed , the increased demand for organic food reflects a sea change in consumer awareness in germany and seems to be here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic supermarkets stock everything from cabbage to cosmetics one of the reasons for the surge of interest in organic food is increased consumer and health awareness with ever more people turning their backs on genetically-modified food .
some 70 percent of german consumers and 50 percent in europe are said to be against gm food . a string of food scandals in germany has also undermined consumer confidence in conventionally-grown food . edda müller , head of the federal association for consumer affairs , said that a bargain-hunting mentality among germans was on the wane when it came to buying foodstuff . " we can count on the fact that buying good quality food will eventually become a question of social status , " müller told ard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms ride boom in natural cosmetics organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

the increasing disparity between rich and poor , as well as diminishing family structures , are to blame . germany is one of the wealthiest countries in europe .
yet thousands of children are living on the streets , according to the children 's relief organization terre des hommes -lrb- tdh -rrb- . " we have observed this development in germany for the past 10 years , " tdh director peter mucke told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung on thursday .
" in this time , the number of street children has grown significantly . " mucke quoted statistics by the german ministry for family affairs , which estimates that there are up to 7,000 children living on the country 's streets . the gap between rich and poor is growing mucke said the problem was particularly pronounced in larger cities , such as hamburg and berlin , where tdh also has projects for street children . " in hamburg , you can see children who hang around on the streets all day long , but also in part live on the streets at night , too , " mucke said .
the street children included those who have completely left home and those who live on the street all day but have a shelter for the night . according to mucke , the growing gap between rich and poor in germany was to blame . " it 's a similar phenomenon as in developing countries , in which a few profit from growing wealth and , at the same time , a lot of people become poorer , " mucke said .
he added that weakening family ties and stability also played a role . german society faces a breakdown if this situation continued , a ghettoization of the rich could result in germany , mucke said .
this was already the case in many developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations like the lindenhaus in dresden give shelter to homeless youth " there , the rich often live completely insulated from the poor , " mucke said .
" this results in a downright break in society . " some 2.5 million children under the age of 18 live below the poverty line in germany , according to government figures .
the federal statistics office warned last month that a further 1.7 million children are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to their parents ' unemployment . helping children quickly osnabrück-based tdh germany celebrates its 40th anniversary on monday .
it was founded on jan .
8 , 1967 , to help children injured in the vietnam war .
the terre des hommes movement was started in switzerland in 1960 . " the images of the war in vietnam robbed us of our sleep , " said founding member lutz beisel .
" we wanted to help quickly and found doctors , hospitals and foster parents to take care of these children . "
the initiative brought vietnamese children to germany for treatment . today , tdh germany supports around 500 projects in 25 countries in africa , asia , latin america and germany .
in 2005 , it received 25.9 million euros -lrb- $ 33.9 million -rrb- in donations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than 10 million germans threatened by poverty charity associations are demanding that unemployment benefits be raised after the federal statistics office announced that 13 percent of germans are in danger of falling into poverty , largely due to unemployment .

11 accomplice protests innocence as sentence looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq said the court did n't want to hear the truth lawyers for the first man ever convicted of a role in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks called for a halt to the ongoing trial in hamburg , saying that the proceedings violate the german constitution . a moroccan convicted as an accomplice in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states protested his innocence on friday in a german court as his sentencing hearing began . " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america , " mounir el motassadeq cried , referring to three of the attackers , including presumed ringleader mohammed atta , to whom he has been linked .
" i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " " there are so many claims that do not add up - i can refute everything ... but you do n't want to know the truth , " the bearded 32-year-old added , turning to the state prosecution . motassadeq faces up to 15 years in jail when the court in hamburg hands down his sentence on monday . lawyers want suspension in november , germany 's highest appeals court found that he had been an accessory to murder in the suicide attacks on new york and washington more than five years ago .
it also found him guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization . the court referred the case for sentencing to hamburg , the northern city where as a student he had befriended the men who would later fly hijacked passenger planes into the world trade center and the pentagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks killed more than 3,000 people on friday , motassadeq 's lawyers challenged the legitimacy of the lower court and demanded the process be suspended .
they argued that the bench had been " hastily and randomly " assembled and was therefore unconstitutional . presiding judge carsten beckmann said the bench would deal with the defense 's arguments on monday before sentencing motassadeq . this is expected to bring an end to a marathon legal process spanning five years though a justice official said on friday that motassadeq could again appeal his new sentence . first person convicted in attacks motassadeq , a father of two , was arrested in late 2001 .
in 2003 , he became the first person to be convicted over the attacks and was sentenced to 15 years in prison . but the federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al-qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was initally arrested in 2001 . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organization but was cleared of abetting mass murder . the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the september 11 attacks . playing a role still , he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of a hamburg-based terror cell which included atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . that verdict was scrapped in november when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had played a role in the death of the 246 passengers and crew of the four aircraft used in the attacks . it said that he had " facilitated and supported the attacks . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . he told the court on friday that his pregnant wife and their children live with his parents in morocco . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders sept .

" there were considerably more people casting their votes than , for example , in the last election for the european parliament , " jacobs said . " this shows that people really wanted to make their voices heard because they care about their city . " not restored after war damage the baroque city palace was built by the famous architect wenzelslaus von knobelsdorff , while the prussian king frederic ii lent a hand in designing its interior .
during an allied bombing raid in 1945 , the palace was damaged . although 83 percent of the building survived the bombing and could have been rebuilt , the communist leaders in former east german decided to tear it down , allegedly for ideological reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdam is littered with castles and baroque monuments ideology apparently also played a decisive role later on in the battle over rebuilding the palace .
potsdam ’ s strongest political force , the left party -lrb- the successor to the old east german communist rulers -rrb- , twice rejected the plans in the city parliament . left party reconsiders its position but now some 43 percent of potsdamers have said yes in a referendum that was to decide from a total of three rebuilding options for the barren heart of the city . " it ’ s not what we wanted , " said hans-jürgen scharfenberg , the left party ’ s parliamentary leader .
" but we ’ ll respect people ’ s decisions .
some 43 percent have said they want the palace back which is a result that should make us rethink our position in parliament . " at the end of january , the city parliament will hold a third vote with the left party , which is now expected to give the green light . new design not an exact replica the city palace is not going to be rebuilt entirely in its old style .
only the building 's northern facade will be recreated , with the side wings and the southern facade to be redone in a more modern design .
that 's due to the fact that the state assembly of brandenburg , of which potsdam is the capital , is to move into the palace by 2011 . despite the partial reconstruction plan and the massive price tag of 85 million euros on the project , potsdamers seem glad to have their historic center back . " i think it 's great , " said one potsdam resident , who added that she was one of those who voted for the palace simply because it belongs to potsdam . another resident praised the referendum process , saying that it should also be used to decide other important issues in the city . funded by donations those in favor of rebuilding the palace may have been swayed by the fact that the famous fortuna gate of the palace was reconstructed four years ago , funded by wealthy potsdamers . now all of the palace supporters are called on to put their money where their mouths are because much of the building costs will be funded by private donations . uwe hessler -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .

he has been voted the most promising new artist in the poll of influential and impartial music writers and broadcasters .
grace kelly by mika " hype is scary , " says mika , the colourful 23-year-old pop singer-songwriter .
" but this is one of the best things to happen to me so far because the people doing this poll have nothing to gain . "
mika -lrb- pronounced " meeka " -rrb- is already getting a lot of attention for an artist at the start of his career .
his first full single , grace kelly , has generated 250,000 plays on myspace in less than four months and is playlisted on bbc radio 1 and radio 2 .
the single and his album , life in cartoon motion , have been described as a fusion of beck , prince and t-rex - but there is one artist almost everyone compares his voice to .
" the comparisons to freddie mercury are fine , " he says .
" they started long before i made the record - i 've even referred to it in grace kelly .
i got the mickey taken out of me at school - i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person mika " a freddie comparison is a compliment .
he 's a genius and one of the best there 's ever been . "
but the media 's attempts to pigeonhole him are " annoying " , he adds .
" i have to remember that no-one knows who i am , or where to place me .
" i consider myself a singer songwriter , which can be a stigma - you 're seen as singing self-indulgent dinner party music .
" i want to make big sounding pop records . "
born in beirut in 1983 , mika and his family had to be evacuated and ended up in london via paris .
mika says he was initially rejected for being " too strange " it is from this lifestyle , mika tells me , that he has an " airport accent " - but it is also what led him to take up singing and writing when he was 10 years old .
" i found school pretty tough , " he admits .
" i got the mickey taken out of me at school .
i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person .
" i missed school for months when i first came to london and then i got a russian music teacher .
i started singing and it was awesome - music got me back on my feet . "
he went on to take any music job he could - including writing a jingle for orbit chewing gum , for which he was paid the handsome sum of £ 45 .
his record deal , in typical flamboyant style , was signed after he played to universal record reps in a hotel lobby .
" i was rejected for years though , " he explains .
" the indie scene thought i was too melody-based and i was rejected by the commercial scene because i was too strange .
" i write songs about fat girls and about men who run off to mexico . "
the uk is an amazing atmosphere for pop at the moment - it 's so full of artistry and innocence mika the internet finally brought recognition after entertainment newsletter popbitch described him as " the breakout superstar of the next few years . "
" i woke up and suddenly there were 600 friend requests for my myspace , " he recalls .
" and every time i deleted them , hundreds more kept on coming . "
he is now embarking on a uk tour and says europe and the united states are " shaping up pretty nicely " .
he has a sold out gig at koko in london in february and says his ambitions for 2007 are to reach more people by playing live .
break the mould " i really want people to know me , and if they like me , to stick with me and to give me enough of a chance , " he says .
" i really want longevity .
the uk is an amazing atmosphere for pop at the moment - by that i mean anything from razorlight to kt tunstall , anything that 's popular .
it 's so full of artistry and innocence . "
he seems far more assured than his years , but claims he has " been forced to know what i want " .
" it 's especially difficult if you do n't want to be on the x factor , " he says .
" grace kelly was written after these musicians were trying to mould me into what i should be .
" i was really angry and so i wrote the song and mailed them the lyrics .
they did n't call me back , but two years later it 's come full circle . "
more than 130 impartial uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in to the sound of 2007 poll by naming their three favourite new acts .
these tips were weighted to take account of each pundit 's stature , genre and record in previous polls , as well as the order in which they ranked their tips , with the results compiled into a top 10 .

he has been voted the most promising new artist in the poll of influential and impartial music writers and broadcasters .
grace kelly by mika " hype is scary , " says mika , the colourful 23-year-old pop singer-songwriter .
" but this is one of the best things to happen to me so far because the people doing this poll have nothing to gain . "
mika -lrb- pronounced " meeka " -rrb- is already getting a lot of attention for an artist at the start of his career .
his first full single , grace kelly , has generated 250,000 plays on myspace in less than four months and is playlisted on bbc radio 1 and radio 2 .
the single and his album , life in cartoon motion , have been described as a fusion of beck , prince and t-rex - but there is one artist almost everyone compares his voice to .
" the comparisons to freddie mercury are fine , " he says .
" they started long before i made the record - i 've even referred to it in grace kelly .
i got the mickey taken out of me at school - i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person mika " a freddie comparison is a compliment .
he 's a genius and one of the best there 's ever been . "
but the media 's attempts to pigeonhole him are " annoying " , he adds .
" i have to remember that no-one knows who i am , or where to place me .
" i consider myself a singer songwriter , which can be a stigma - you 're seen as singing self-indulgent dinner party music .
" i want to make big sounding pop records . "
born in beirut in 1983 , mika and his family had to be evacuated and ended up in london via paris .
mika says he was initially rejected for being " too strange " it is from this lifestyle , mika tells me , that he has an " airport accent " - but it is also what led him to take up singing and writing when he was 10 years old .
" i found school pretty tough , " he admits .
" i got the mickey taken out of me at school .
i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person .
" i missed school for months when i first came to london and then i got a russian music teacher .
i started singing and it was awesome - music got me back on my feet . "
he went on to take any music job he could - including writing a jingle for orbit chewing gum , for which he was paid the handsome sum of £ 45 .
his record deal , in typical flamboyant style , was signed after he played to universal record reps in a hotel lobby .
" i was rejected for years though , " he explains .
" the indie scene thought i was too melody-based and i was rejected by the commercial scene because i was too strange .

" but this is one of the best things to happen to me so far because the people doing this poll have nothing to gain . "
mika -lrb- pronounced " meeka " -rrb- is already getting a lot of attention for an artist at the start of his career .
his first full single , grace kelly , has generated 250,000 plays on myspace in less than four months and is playlisted on bbc radio 1 and radio 2 .
the single and his album , life in cartoon motion , have been described as a fusion of beck , prince and t-rex - but there is one artist almost everyone compares his voice to .
" the comparisons to freddie mercury are fine , " he says .
" they started long before i made the record - i 've even referred to it in grace kelly . "
i got the mickey taken out of me at school - i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person " mika " a freddie comparison is a compliment .
he 's a genius and one of the best there 's ever been . "
but the media 's attempts to pigeonhole him are " annoying " , he adds .
" i have to remember that no-one knows who i am , or where to place me .
" i consider myself a singer songwriter , which can be a stigma - you 're seen as singing self-indulgent dinner party music .
" i want to make big sounding pop records . "
born in beirut in 1983 , mika and his family had to be evacuated and ended up in london via paris .
it is from this lifestyle , mika tells me , that he has an " airport accent " - but it is also what led him to take up singing and writing when he was 10 years old .
" i found school pretty tough , " he admits .
" i got the mickey taken out of me at school .
i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person .
" i missed school for months when i first came to london and then i got a russian music teacher .
i started singing and it was awesome - music got me back on my feet . "
he went on to take any music job he could - including writing a jingle for orbit chewing gum , for which he was paid the handsome sum of £ 45 .
his record deal , in typical flamboyant style , was signed after he played to universal record reps in a hotel lobby .
" i was rejected for years though , " he explains .
" the indie scene thought i was too melody-based and i was rejected by the commercial scene because i was too strange .
" i write songs about fat girls and about men who run off to mexico . "
" the uk is an amazing atmosphere for pop at the moment - it 's so full of artistry and innocence " mika the internet finally brought recognition after entertainment newsletter popbitch described him as " the breakout superstar of the next few years . "
" i woke up and suddenly there were 600 friend requests for my myspace , " he recalls .
" and every time i deleted them , hundreds more kept on coming . "
he is now embarking on a uk tour and says europe and the united states are " shaping up pretty nicely " .
he has a sold out gig at koko in london in february and says his ambitions for 2007 are to reach more people by playing live .
break the mould " i really want people to know me , and if they like me , to stick with me and to give me enough of a chance , " he says .
" i really want longevity .
the uk is an amazing atmosphere for pop at the moment - by that i mean anything from razorlight to kt tunstall , anything that 's popular .
it 's so full of artistry and innocence . "
he seems far more assured than his years , but claims he has " been forced to know what i want " .
" it 's especially difficult if you do n't want to be on the x factor , " he says .
" grace kelly was written after these musicians were trying to mould me into what i should be .
" i was really angry and so i wrote the song and mailed them the lyrics .
they did n't call me back , but two years later it 's come full circle . "
more than 130 impartial uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in to the sound of 2007 poll by naming their three favourite new acts .
these tips were weighted to take account of each pundit 's stature , genre and record in previous polls , as well as the order in which they ranked their tips , with the results compiled into a top 10 .

environment agency wales said giant hogweed was causing increasing problems for landowners , walkers and fishermen .
as well as damaging the environment , hogweed is poisonous , and its sap can cause blisters which are sensitive to sunlight .
the agency said getting rid of the plant could take up to 10 years .
a special forum takes place next month to discuss dealing with the plant .
the hogweed is mainly found between crickhowell and newbridge-on-usk but some is also found close to the mouth of the river in usk .
the plant is a native of the caucasus mountains between russia and turkey and was originally introduced in britain as an ornamental plant in the late 19th century . "
every effort is being to reduce and contain this invasive plant on the lower usk , where it has become a growing problem . "
stuart craxford the perennial plant can grow up to five metres tall with leaves reaching one metre across .
each plant can produce more than 50,000 seeds every year , which can remain viable for 15 years .
environment agency wales , in partnership with other agencies , started work last spring on ridding the usk of the hogweed .
project manager for the agency stuart craxford said the programme aimed to stop the seed production at the upper extent of the infestation , preventing the seeds entering the usk and spreading the problem further downstream .
mr craxford said the usk was believed to have one of the biggest problems with hogweed in the uk .
" we are looking at this problem and its solution in a detailed , systematic way , " he said .
" every effort is being made to reduce and contain this invasive plant on the lower usk , where it has become a growing problem .
" if the work is successful there will be benefits for conservation , recreation and flood defence work . "
he said there was also a health and safety issue with the hogweed .
the edges and underside of the leaves bear small hairs , which are coated with a poisonous sap , and even the slightest touch can cause painful blistering and severe irritation .
the reaction can occur up to 48 hours after contact and , in some cases , can lead to recurrent dermatitis .
the environment agency has spent £ 5,000 on the first phase of the project and during 2005-6 it surveyed mapped and developed a control strategy the giant hogweed forum is to take place at coleg gwent 's usk campus between 1900 and 2100 gmt on 13 february .

the 21-year-old announced on her myspace weblog that she had received a call from a man claiming to have bought maggie may , an english bull terrier .
she wrote that friends had met the man and gave him a cash reward in return for her pet .
allen said she was " overjoyed " but added that maggie may was " very thin " so may have been " mistreated " .
allen , whose hits include smile , said she had concerns after her friends were offered more puppies to buy , after maggie may had been handed over .
" these people were obviously in the business of moving dogs .
now i feel guilty for having given these people money and contributing to their cruel business but i love that dog and felt i had no choice , " she said .
she added that maggie may had fleas which made her suspect she had been kept with other " maybe stolen " animals .
the star said the matter was now with the rspca and the police .
lily allen had a number one hit in 2006 with smile allen added that she had been accused by some people of " neglecting her dog " which was " distressing and hurtful " .
" people have been speculating that because maggie was thin and had fleas she must have run away , maggie was tied up and in her cage in the back of a van and could not have escaped , she was stolen , " she said .
maggie may was taken from her friend 's van in forest gate , east london , on 28 december .
a spokesman for dog lost , a website that helps find missing canines , said there was a " huge " problem with such breeds being stolen in east london .
allen pleaded for information about the theft on her myspace page last week and also posted details of maggie on the dog lost website .
the site 's founder , jane hayes , said : " we think there are gangs operating in east london stealing dogs for organised dog fights .

he has been voted the most promising new artist in the poll of influential and impartial music writers and broadcasters .
grace kelly by mika mika -lrb- pronounced " meeka " -rrb- is getting a lot of attention for an artist at the start of his career .
his first full single , grace kelly , has generated 250,000 plays on myspace in less than four months and is playlisted on bbc radio 1 and radio 2 .
the single and his album , life in cartoon motion , have been described as a fusion of beck , prince , the scissor sisters and t-rex - but there is one artist almost everyone compares his voice to .
" the comparisons to freddie mercury are fine , " the 23-year-old says .
" they started long before i made the record - i 've even referred to it in grace kelly .
" a freddie comparison is a compliment .
he 's a genius and one of the best there 's ever been . "
i got the mickey taken out of me at school - i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person mika send us your comments but the media 's attempts to pigeonhole him are " annoying " , he adds .
" i have to remember that no-one knows who i am , or where to place me .
" i consider myself a singer songwriter , which can be a stigma - you 're seen as singing self-indulgent dinner party music .
" i want to make big sounding pop records . "
born in beirut in 1983 , mika and his family had to be evacuated and ended up in london via paris .
mika says he was initially rejected for being " too strange " it is from this lifestyle , mika tells me , that he has an " airport accent " - but it is also what led him to take up singing and writing when he was 10 years old .
" i found school pretty tough , " he admits .
" i got the mickey taken out of me at school .
i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person .
" i missed school for months when i first came to london and then i got a russian music teacher .
i started singing and it was awesome - music got me back on my feet . "
he went on to take any music job he could - including writing a jingle for orbit chewing gum , for which he was paid the handsome sum of £ 45 .
his record deal , in typical flamboyant style , was signed after he played to universal record reps in a hotel lobby .
" i was rejected for years though , " he explains .
" the indie scene thought i was too melody-based and i was rejected by the commercial scene because i was too strange .
" i write songs about fat girls and about men who run off to mexico . "
the uk is an amazing atmosphere for pop at the moment - it 's so full of artistry and innocence mika the internet finally brought recognition after entertainment newsletter popbitch described him as " the breakout superstar of the next few years . "
" i woke up and suddenly there were 600 friend requests for my myspace , " he recalls .
" and every time i deleted them , hundreds more kept on coming . "
he is now embarking on a uk tour and says europe and the united states are " shaping up pretty nicely " .
he has a sold out gig at koko in london in february and says his ambitions for 2007 are to reach more people by playing live .
break the mould " i really want people to know me , and if they like me , to stick with me and to give me enough of a chance , " he says .
" i really want longevity .
the uk is an amazing atmosphere for pop at the moment - by that i mean anything from razorlight to kt tunstall , anything that 's popular .
it 's so full of artistry and innocence . "
he seems far more assured than his years , but claims he has " been forced to know what i want " .
" it 's especially difficult if you do n't want to be on the x factor , " he says .
" grace kelly was written after these musicians were trying to mould me into what i should be .
" i was really angry and so i wrote the song and mailed them the lyrics .
they did n't call me back , but two years later it 's come full circle . "
more than 130 impartial uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in to the sound of 2007 poll by naming their three favourite new acts .
these tips were weighted to take account of each pundit 's stature , genre and record in previous polls , as well as the order in which they ranked their tips , with the results compiled into a top 10 .

he has been voted the most promising new artist in the poll of influential and impartial music writers and broadcasters .
grace kelly by mika mika -lrb- pronounced " meeka " -rrb- is getting a lot of attention for an artist at the start of his career .
his first full single , grace kelly , has generated 250,000 plays on myspace in less than four months and is playlisted on bbc radio 1 and radio 2 .
the single and his album , life in cartoon motion , have been described as a fusion of beck , prince , the scissor sisters and t-rex - but there is one artist almost everyone compares his voice to .
" the comparisons to freddie mercury are fine , " the 23-year-old says .
" they started long before i made the record - i 've even referred to it in grace kelly .
" a freddie comparison is a compliment .
he 's a genius and one of the best there 's ever been . "
i got the mickey taken out of me at school - i twigged it was easier to say stuff in a song than to a person mika send us your comments but the media 's attempts to pigeonhole him are " annoying " , he adds .
" i have to remember that no-one knows who i am , or where to place me .
" i consider myself a singer songwriter , which can be a stigma - you 're seen as singing self-indulgent dinner party music .
" i want to make big sounding pop records . "
born in beirut in 1983 , mika and his family had to be evacuated and ended up in london via paris .
mika says he was initially rejected for being " too strange " it is from this lifestyle , mika tells me , that he has an " airport accent " - but it is also what led him to take up singing and writing when he was 10 years old .
" i found school pretty tough , " he admits .

he went on to take any music job he could - including writing a jingle for orbit chewing gum , for which he was paid the handsome sum of £ 45 .
his record deal , in typical flamboyant style , was signed after he played to universal record reps in a hotel lobby .

the 21-year-old announced on her myspace weblog that she had received a call from a man claiming to have bought maggie may , an english bull terrier .
she wrote that friends had met the man and gave him a cash reward in return for her pet .
allen said she was " overjoyed " but added that maggie may was " very thin " so may have been " mistreated " .
allen , whose hits include smile , said she had concerns after her friends were offered more puppies to buy , after maggie may had been handed over .
" these people were obviously in the business of moving dogs .
now i feel guilty for having given these people money and contributing to their cruel business but i love that dog and felt i had no choice , " she said .
she added that maggie may had fleas which made her suspect she had been kept with other " maybe stolen " animals .
the star said the matter was now with the rspca and the police .
allen added that she had been accused by some people of " neglecting her dog " which was " distressing and hurtful " .
" people have been speculating that because maggie was thin and had fleas she must have run away , maggie was tied up and in her cage in the back of a van and could not have escaped , she was stolen , " she said .
maggie may was taken from her friend 's van in forest gate , east london , on 28 december .
a spokesman for dog lost , a website that helps find missing canines , said there was a " huge " problem with such breeds being stolen in east london .
allen pleaded for information about the theft on her myspace page last week and also posted details of maggie on the dog lost website .
the site 's founder , jane hayes , said : " we think there are gangs operating in east london stealing dogs for organised dog fights .
" we also think they are being sold in pubs by people looking for quick money for drugs .
" we get at least 100 reports a week of dogs lost , presumed stolen , and the site gets about 1.5 million hits a week . "

on sunday bill gates will open the consumer electronics show in las vegas with a speech focusing on microsoft 's role in the connected world .
the digital home and the move to a high definition age will dominate the agenda at ces , say analysts .
on tuesday in san francisco , apple boss steve jobs will address mac devotees .
devices which move digital content around the home - from pc to pc and to tvs , hi-fis and other products - have been available for some years but the digital living room battleground is still to be won .
companies such as netgear , d-link , hp and intel are all expected to unveil new products at ces which make it easier to hook up the digital home and share content such as films and music . "
apple will not be physically present but will cast a huge shadow over the show " jupiterresearch analyst michael gartenberg these companies have allied themselves with microsoft 's vision of connectivity and on sunday evening mr gates will deliver the opening keynote of ces and is expected once again to concentrate on the themes of digital content in the home and beyond .
microsoft has partnered with a number of companies around the world - including bt in the uk - to help deliver video content via the net , called iptv , and to offer a platform for sharing content built around its new operating system , vista .
analyst michael gartenberg , jupiter research director , said : " i expect a strong push from microsoft relating to vista . "
the networked home is such a complicated technology " sean wargo , consumer electronics association " this will also likely be bill gates ' final ces .
it will be his swan song and i expect a lot of nostalgia during the evening . "
he added : " apple will not be physically present , but will cast a huge shadow over the show . "
in fact , there may well be a mass exodus from ces on monday night to san francisco ahead of apple chief executive steve jobs giving his keynote speech .
' critical part ' " apple has gone from being just another computer manufacturer to being a critical part of the consumer electronics industry , " said mr gartenberg .
apple is tipped to give more details about its itv device , which shares video and other digital content around the home ; a key part of its digital home strategy .
analyst sean wargo said : " the networked home is such a complicated technology - you 've got networking infrastructure that needs to be in place , you need devices that can tie into that network and you need content .
" each year there has been developments in one or all of these areas .
the latest development has been around the interface you use to interact or manage that content . "
with apple choosing its own path in san francisco and many companies in las vegas securely attached to microsoft 's vision for the digital home , with vista at the centre of plans , there are two key rival strategies for the future emerging .
swarming more than 140,000 people will attend ces , swarming over more than three million square feet of conference halls , housing the latest digital devices and gadgets mr wargo , director of industry analysis at the consumer electronics association , the organiser of ces , said : " one of the other major themes of this year is the services and content that feed the networked home . "
mr wargo said the drive for higher resolutions and " beyond hi-def " displays , cameras and games consoles would be the stars of the show .
" high definition tv is driving industry growth now - in the us we are going through a massive display upgrade cycle .
" we 're seeing unprecedented volume of tv selling through retail right now .
it 's pushing that market to new heights .
it is now the single biggest product category . "
mr gartenberg said the focus of ces would be the ongoing move from analogue to digital lives , both in the domestic and business worlds .
' huge content ' " there will be a lot of stuff related to the digital home - especially for people who have problems with building and managing these huge content libraries of video , music and photos . "
mr wargo said next generation dvd would certainly be part of the buzz of the show .
a lot of people i would expect would be talking about the two formats and whether they will persist for a considerable amount of time . "
blu-ray and hd-dvd are rival and incompatible high definition dvd formats and have a number of different backers .
sony is the flag-bearer for blu-ray while toshiba and microsoft are firmly in the hd-dvd camp .
mr wargo said : " attendees will be looking for signs of one format pulling ahead of the other or if both formats can coexist . "
the battle may be altered following the news that korean giant lg is to announce a dvd player which can play both formats .
the appearance of yahoo and google at last year 's show reflected the rising importance of content and services to the digital home and mr wargo said he expected 2007 to be no different .
" we are seeing two fronts maturing - the hardware and operating system that will control this system and the content that will feed it .
" there 's a story of how the online community is emerging as a potential competitor to the cable , satellite and packaged media industry .
the fact that walt disney and cbs are giving keynotes tell the story of how this market place is really growing beyond the boundaries of hardware and moving into content and software . "

on sunday bill gates will open the consumer electronics show in las vegas with a speech focusing on microsoft 's role in the connected world .
the digital home and the move to a high definition age will dominate the agenda at ces , say analysts .
on tuesday in san francisco , apple boss steve jobs will address mac devotees .
devices which move digital content around the home - from pc to pc and to tvs , hi-fis and other products - have been available for some years but the digital living room battleground is still to be won .
companies such as netgear , d-link , hp and intel are all expected to unveil new products at ces which make it easier to hook up the digital home and share content such as films and music .
apple will not be physically present but will cast a huge shadow over the show jupiterresearch analyst michael gartenberg these companies have allied themselves with microsoft 's vision of connectivity and on sunday evening mr gates will deliver the opening keynote of ces and is expected once again to concentrate on the themes of digital content in the home and beyond .
microsoft has partnered with a number of companies around the world - including bt in the uk - to help deliver video content via the net , called iptv , and to offer a platform for sharing content built around its new operating system , vista .
analyst michael gartenberg , jupiter research director , said : " i expect a strong push from microsoft relating to vista .
the networked home is such a complicated technology sean wargo , consumer electronics association " this will also likely be bill gates ' final ces .
it will be his swan song and i expect a lot of nostalgia during the evening . "
he added : " apple will not be physically present , but will cast a huge shadow over the show . "
in fact , there may well be a mass exodus from ces on monday night to san francisco ahead of apple chief executive steve jobs giving his keynote speech .
' critical part ' " apple has gone from being just another computer manufacturer to being a critical part of the consumer electronics industry , " said mr gartenberg .
apple boss steve jobs will deliver his speech on tuesday apple is tipped to give more details about its itv device , which shares video and other digital content around the home ; a key part of its digital home strategy .
analyst sean wargo said : " the networked home is such a complicated technology - you 've got networking infrastructure that needs to be in place , you need devices that can tie into that network and you need content .
" each year there has been developments in one or all of these areas .
the latest development has been around the interface you use to interact or manage that content . "
with apple choosing its own path in san francisco and many companies in las vegas securely attached to microsoft 's vision for the digital home , with vista at the centre of plans , there are two key rival strategies for the future emerging .
swarming more than 140,000 people will attend ces , swarming over more than three million square feet of conference halls , housing the latest digital devices and gadgets mr wargo , director of industry analysis at the consumer electronics association , the organiser of ces , said : " one of the other major themes of this year is the services and content that feed the networked home . "
mr wargo said the drive for higher resolutions and " beyond hi-def " displays , cameras and games consoles would be the stars of the show .
" high definition tv is driving industry growth now - in the us we are going through a massive display upgrade cycle .
" we 're seeing unprecedented volume of tv selling through retail right now .
it 's pushing that market to new heights .
it is now the single biggest product category . "
mr gartenberg said the focus of ces would be the ongoing move from analogue to digital lives , both in the domestic and business worlds .
' huge content ' " there will be a lot of stuff related to the digital home - especially for people who have problems with building and managing these huge content libraries of video , music and photos . "
mr wargo said next generation dvd would certainly be part of the buzz of the show .
a lot of people i would expect would be talking about the two formats and whether they will persist for a considerable amount of time . "
blu-ray and hd-dvd are rival and incompatible high definition dvd formats and have a number of different backers .
sony is the flag-bearer for blu-ray while toshiba and microsoft are firmly in the hd-dvd camp .
high definition tvs will dominate the show floor mr wargo said : " attendees will be looking for signs of one format pulling ahead of the other or if both formats can coexist . "
the battle may be altered following the news that korean giant lg is to announce a dvd player which can play both formats .
the appearance of yahoo and google at last year 's show reflected the rising importance of content and services to the digital home and mr wargo said he expected 2007 to be no different .
" we are seeing two fronts maturing - the hardware and operating system that will control this system and the content that will feed it .
" there 's a story of how the online community is emerging as a potential competitor to the cable , satellite and packaged media industry .
the fact that walt disney and cbs are giving keynotes tell the story of how this market place is really growing beyond the boundaries of hardware and moving into content and software . "

blu-ray and hd-dvd are rival and incompatible high definition dvd formats and have a number of different backers .
sony is the flag-bearer for blu-ray while toshiba and microsoft are firmly in the hd-dvd camp .
high definition tvs will dominate the show floor mr wargo said : " attendees will be looking for signs of one format pulling ahead of the other or if both formats can coexist . "
the battle may be altered following the news that korean giant lg is to announce a dvd player which can play both formats .
the appearance of yahoo and google at last year 's show reflected the rising importance of content and services to the digital home and mr wargo said he expected 2007 to be no different .

the digital home and the move to a high definition age will dominate the agenda at ces , say analysts .
on tuesday in san francisco , apple boss steve jobs will address mac devotees .
devices which move digital content around the home - from pc to pc and to tvs , hi-fis and other products - have been available for some years but the digital living room battleground is still to be won .
companies such as netgear , d-link , hp and intel are all expected to unveil new products at ces which make it easier to hook up the digital home and share content such as films and music .
apple will not be physically present but will cast a huge shadow over the show jupiterresearch analyst michael gartenberg these companies have allied themselves with microsoft 's vision of connectivity and on sunday evening mr gates will deliver the opening keynote of ces and is expected once again to concentrate on the themes of digital content in the home and beyond .
microsoft has partnered with a number of companies around the world - including bt in the uk - to help deliver video content via the net , called iptv , and to offer a platform for sharing content built around its new operating system , vista .
analyst michael gartenberg , jupiter research director , said : " i expect a strong push from microsoft relating to vista .
the networked home is such a complicated technology sean wargo , consumer electronics association " this will also likely be bill gates ' final ces .
it will be his swan song and i expect a lot of nostalgia during the evening . "
he added : " apple will not be physically present , but will cast a huge shadow over the show . "
in fact , there may well be a mass exodus from ces on monday night to san francisco ahead of apple chief executive steve jobs giving his keynote speech .
' critical part ' " apple has gone from being just another computer manufacturer to being a critical part of the consumer electronics industry , " said mr gartenberg .
apple boss steve jobs will deliver his speech on tuesday apple is tipped to give more details about its itv device , which shares video and other digital content around the home ; a key part of its digital home strategy .
analyst sean wargo said : " the networked home is such a complicated technology - you 've got networking infrastructure that needs to be in place , you need devices that can tie into that network and you need content .
" each year there has been developments in one or all of these areas .
the latest development has been around the interface you use to interact or manage that content . "
with apple choosing its own path in san francisco and many companies in las vegas securely attached to microsoft 's vision for the digital home , with vista at the centre of plans , there are two key rival strategies for the future emerging .
swarming more than 140,000 people will attend ces , swarming over more than three million square feet of conference halls , housing the latest digital devices and gadgets mr wargo , director of industry analysis at the consumer electronics association , the organiser of ces , said : " one of the other major themes of this year is the services and content that feed the networked home . "
mr wargo said the drive for higher resolutions and " beyond hi-def " displays , cameras and games consoles would be the stars of the show .
" high definition tv is driving industry growth now - in the us we are going through a massive display upgrade cycle .
" we 're seeing unprecedented volume of tv selling through retail right now .
it 's pushing that market to new heights .
it is now the single biggest product category . "
mr gartenberg said the focus of ces would be the ongoing move from analogue to digital lives , both in the domestic and business worlds .

microsoft has partnered with a number of companies around the world - including bt in the uk - to help deliver video content via the net , called iptv , and to offer a platform for sharing content built around its new operating system , vista .
analyst michael gartenberg , jupiter research director , said : " i expect a strong push from microsoft relating to vista .
the networked home is such a complicated technology sean wargo , consumer electronics association " this will also likely be bill gates ' final ces .
it will be his swan song and i expect a lot of nostalgia during the evening . "
he added : " apple will not be physically present , but will cast a huge shadow over the show . "
in fact , there may well be a mass exodus from ces on monday night to san francisco ahead of apple chief executive steve jobs giving his keynote speech .
' critical part ' " apple has gone from being just another computer manufacturer to being a critical part of the consumer electronics industry , " said mr gartenberg .
apple boss steve jobs will deliver his speech on tuesday apple is tipped to give more details about its itv device , which shares video and other digital content around the home ; a key part of its digital home strategy .
analyst sean wargo said : " the networked home is such a complicated technology - you 've got networking infrastructure that needs to be in place , you need devices that can tie into that network and you need content .
" each year there has been developments in one or all of these areas .
the latest development has been around the interface you use to interact or manage that content . "
with apple choosing its own path in san francisco and many companies in las vegas securely attached to microsoft 's vision for the digital home , with vista at the centre of plans , there are two key rival strategies for the future emerging .
swarming more than 140,000 people will attend ces , swarming over more than three million square feet of conference halls , housing the latest digital devices and gadgets mr wargo , director of industry analysis at the consumer electronics association , the organiser of ces , said : " one of the other major themes of this year is the services and content that feed the networked home . "
mr wargo said the drive for higher resolutions and " beyond hi-def " displays , cameras and games consoles would be the stars of the show .
" high definition tv is driving industry growth now - in the us we are going through a massive display upgrade cycle .
" we 're seeing unprecedented volume of tv selling through retail right now .
it 's pushing that market to new heights .
it is now the single biggest product category . "
mr gartenberg said the focus of ces would be the ongoing move from analogue to digital lives , both in the domestic and business worlds .
' huge content ' " there will be a lot of stuff related to the digital home - especially for people who have problems with building and managing these huge content libraries of video , music and photos . "
mr wargo said next generation dvd would certainly be part of the buzz of the show .
a lot of people i would expect would be talking about the two formats and whether they will persist for a considerable amount of time . "
blu-ray and hd-dvd are rival and incompatible high definition dvd formats and have a number of different backers .
sony is the flag-bearer for blu-ray while toshiba and microsoft are firmly in the hd-dvd camp .
high definition tvs will dominate the show floor mr wargo said : " attendees will be looking for signs of one format pulling ahead of the other or if both formats can coexist . "
the battle may be altered following the news that korean giant lg is to announce a dvd player which can play both formats .
the appearance of yahoo and google at last year 's show reflected the rising importance of content and services to the digital home and mr wargo said he expected 2007 to be no different .
" we are seeing two fronts maturing - the hardware and operating system that will control this system and the content that will feed it .
" there 's a story of how the online community is emerging as a potential competitor to the cable , satellite and packaged media industry .
the fact that walt disney and cbs are giving keynotes tell the story of how this market place is really growing beyond the boundaries of hardware and moving into content and software . "

the report from the country 's biggest mortgage lender confirms the view that property price inflation accelerated last year .
the biggest increases were in northern ireland where prices rose by 53 % .
during december the average uk price fell 1 % to £ 186,035 , but the halifax said that did not necessarily mean the market was cooling .
" it remains too early to conclude that this indicates a genuine slowdown in the housing market , " said the halifax 's chief economist martin ellis .
" overall , prices in the final quarter of 2006 were 4.2 % higher than in the previous quarter , marking the strongest quarterly rise since 2004 q2 , " he pointed out .
industry predictions the report from the halifax chimes with that of many other industry experts .
last week the nationwide building society put house price inflation for 2006 at 10.5 % .
as with the halifax , its survey was based on a sample of its own lending to customers and the prices they pay for houses and other residential properties .
the brisk pick up in house price inflation last year confounded the expectations of many market commentators who had predicted that price rises would be much more subdued .
in line with many others , the halifax is now expecting something of a slowdown , partly thanks to the two recent increases in interest rates and the prospect of more to come .
" continued economic growth , rising employment and an ongoing lack of supply will continue to drive up house prices over the coming months , " said mr ellis .
" higher interest rates , greater pressure on household finances and subdued real earnings growth will , however , constrain housing demand .
we expect house prices to increase by 4 % in 2007 . "

yet many people are unaware of this figure , with nearly half of the 1,006 people surveyed thinking they ate only 10 additives each day .
the research also found that many people do not understand which foods are most likely to contain additives .
the research was commissioned by food manufacturer birds eye . "
consumers should learn how to read food labels so they know exactly what they are buying and eating . "
jill scott the survey found that people in britain were more concerned about additives in their diet than about salt - but many underestimated the number of additives in their diets .
the survey also revealed that many consumers do not understand where food additives lurk , with more than three quarters believing that cooking from scratch will help avoid them completely .
however , the research found though that those who ate home cooked food ate an average of 19 additives over a 24 hour period - just one less than the average across the whole study .
chilled food additives the survey also found that almost half of people believe frozen food contains more preservatives than chilled foods , when in fact the chilled ready meals consumed in the survey contained on average six times more preservatives than frozen ready meals .
nutritionist and registered dietician jill scott warned : " consumers should learn how to read food labels so they know exactly what they are buying and eating . "
food additives are substances intentionally added to food for a specific function , such as to alter the colour , texture of taste of foods , or to preserve them safely .
additive safety some reports have suggested that certain food additives can cause behavioural changes in some children , although many experts agree it is difficult to come to firm conclusions from the research carried out so far .
bridget aisbitt , a nutrition scientist at the british nutrition foundation , said : " i understand that people do n't like the idea of eating additives , but from a safety point of view there is no real problem -lsb- with eating them -rsb- . "
she said the levels of additives in all foods were tightly regulated so that the levels were kept very low , but to avoid them people should prepare their meals from fresh ingredients .
" for salt we have evidence of a detrimental effect , as it seems to raise blood pressure , but i am not aware of any evidence that additives are the same . "
she also pointed out that additives are useful in food to keep food safe , for example by preventing mould from forming .
the food standards agency has recently funded a project to investigate whether artificial food additives do affect the behaviour of children .

she said the levels of additives in all foods were tightly regulated so that the levels were kept very low , but to avoid them people should prepare their meals from fresh ingredients .
" for salt we have evidence of a detrimental effect , as it seems to raise blood pressure , but i am not aware of any evidence that additives are the same . "
she also pointed out that additives are useful in food to keep food safe , for example by preventing mould from forming .
