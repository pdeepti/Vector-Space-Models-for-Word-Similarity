they will then receive a monthly bill for the total of their travel . vodafone says the " touch-points " are equipped with radio chips that transmit data to the mobile phone as they log in and out .
this ticketing information is securely stored on the phone 's sim card and can be checked even if the battery has run down . touch & travel pilot scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers can record their travel at " touch-points " the pilot project , code-named touch & travel , would be operated from october on an inter-city line between berlin and hanover and on pubic transport in the suburbs of berlin . the initial testing will involve volunteer users .
a more extensive pilot involving real passengers and covering berlin 's entire metropolitan rail and subway network is being planned for next year . touch & travel will cover both bus and train services .
there are also plans to integrate deutsche bahn 's car sharing and call-a-bike services into the system , says vodafone . db and vodafone looking to sell system on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the berlin test phase , db hopes the system will go national speaking at the cebit technology fair in hanover , germany , spokespersons for the british-based vodafone and deutsche bahn said they hoped to develop a system that would be saleable to other companies within the next year .
db planned to introduce the system nationally after the pilot phase . to participate , phones must be equipped with near field communication -lrb- nfc -rrb- modules , which are fitted in many handsets . big international phone groups have in the past tested schemes to use phones as devices to make small payments .
such systems would have made phone companies competitors to the credit-card industry , with customers settling their bills monthly with the phone company . previous mobile-phone projects were abandoned after phone companies grew concerned about the high risks and lack of profits . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon thursday on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents share the blame for misbehaving children parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .
officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- politicians in berlin want parents to get the message that raising a child is a serious responsibility .
parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .
it 's still unclear whether the idea is completely legal . spd legal expert fritz felgentreu said he did n't foresee any legal problems and that only the details of the proposed plan needed to be worked out . school violence a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have been called to control school violence the issue of how to curtail juvenile delinquency and violence remains a critical one in germany 's capital city .
last spring , police took over the rütli school in the berlin suburb of neukölln .
teachers complained that violence in the school had gotten out of control .
the school is in a low-rent district with high unemployment . the school brought in social workers and school psychologists while police checked that no one brought weapons onto school property .
at the time , politicians agreed that the problems had a variety of sources , including a lack of economic opportunities . many of the students at the school are children of immigrants and do n't speak german at home . parents could face stiff fines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents need to stop problems early yet apathetic , uncooperative parents are also part of the problem , wolfgang schimmang -lrb- spd -rrb- , neukölln 's education counselor , said in an article in berlin 's der tagesspiegel saturday . " what should we do to reach uncooperative parents ? "
schimmang asked . he believes fines of 50 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 67 - $ 133 -rrb- could help .
it would motivate parents to make sure their children attend school and behave , schimmang said . long-time juvenile court judge kirsten heisig told der tagesspiegel she thought it was a good idea .
to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .
parenting classes were seen as a better option by a spokesman for the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party . a spokesperson for the green party called the idea " political nonsense , " the newspaper reported . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telling tales to combat juvenile violence reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school .
-lrb- 25.04.2006 -rrb- no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers said was out of control .
berlin ’ s education senator came under heavy criticism for refusing to close the secondary school down .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

the main opposition party , the social democrats , is demanding a referendum , and the green party , which forms part of the center-right governing coalition , wants the base integrated in eu and nato defense plans . the proposed rollout of the us missile shield in central europe has split european countries .
germany has failed to open a debate about it within nato , which considers the decision a purely bilateral issue between the us and its staunch allies , the czech republic and poland . moscow has protested against the construction of a defense system installed on its doorstep . the us has offered assurances that the czech and polish bases are aimed at completing coverage from installations already in place in the united states , britain and greenland and that they are only aimed at preventing long range missile attacks from the middle east . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech village casts vote on us anti-missile defense shield residents of a tiny czech village are to vote in a local referendum on a us proposal to construct a radar station making up part of its anti-missile defense system on the neighboring jince army base .

officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- politicians in berlin want parents to get the message that raising a child is a serious responsibility .
parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .
it 's still unclear whether the idea is completely legal . spd legal expert fritz felgentreu said he did n't foresee any legal problems and that only the details of the proposed plan needed to be worked out . school violence a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have been called to control school violence the issue of how to curtail juvenile delinquency and violence remains a critical one in germany 's capital city .
last spring , police took over the rütli school in the berlin suburb of neukölln .
teachers complained that violence in the school had gotten out of control .
the school is in a low-rent district with high unemployment . the school brought in social workers and school psychologists while police checked that no one brought weapons onto school property .
at the time , politicians agreed that the problems had a variety of sources , including a lack of economic opportunities . many of the students at the school are children of immigrants and do n't speak german at home . parents could face stiff fines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents need to stop problems early yet apathetic , uncooperative parents are also part of the problem , wolfgang schimmang -lrb- spd -rrb- , neukölln 's education counselor , said in an article in berlin 's der tagesspiegel saturday . " what should we do to reach uncooperative parents ? "
schimmang asked . he believes fines of 50 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 67 - $ 133 -rrb- could help .
it would motivate parents to make sure their children attend school and behave , schimmang said . long-time juvenile court judge kirsten heisig told der tagesspiegel she thought it was a good idea .
to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .
parenting classes were seen as a better option by a spokesman for the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party . a spokesperson for the green party called the idea " political nonsense , " the newspaper reported . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telling tales to combat juvenile violence reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school .

they will then receive a monthly bill for the total of their travel . vodafone says the " touch-points " are equipped with radio chips that transmit data to the mobile phone as they log in and out .
this ticketing information is securely stored on the phone 's sim card and can be checked even if the battery has run down . touch & travel pilot scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers can record their travel at " touch-points " the pilot project , code-named touch & travel , would be operated from october on an inter-city line between berlin and hanover and on pubic transport in the suburbs of berlin . the initial testing will involve volunteer users .
a more extensive pilot involving real passengers and covering berlin 's entire metropolitan rail and subway network is being planned for next year . touch & travel will cover both bus and train services .

but the us plan to base the system in eastern europe " requires discussions , " he added . " the cold war is over and we are all living under new conditions , " steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference with rice . he welcomed a remark by rice that the us is in talks with moscow to try to soothe russian misgivings .
the aim is to " avoid misunderstandings that might have unintended consequences , " steinmeier said . german parties split by missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's governing parties differ on the us missile defense plan the us is negotiating with nato members poland and czech republic , both former soviet satellites , to host ballistic missile defense components .
plans call for a radar tracking station in the czech republic and up to 10 interceptor missiles to be based in poland . the us anti-missile shield plan has divided politicians in germany 's grand coalition government .
chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia . " the more we explain , the better " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants the us to take russian concerns seriously " we live in a world where we face small nuclear threats , small potential missile threats from for instance iran , " she said .
" in that world , a limited missile defense that can deal with small threats is very much a stabilizing factor , not a destabilizing factor . " but eu leaders who met rice at the state department said russia 's objections must at least be listened to .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ? "
struck asked . according to the prosecutor 's office , all of the accused officers have served abroad , either in afghanistan or the balkans .
they had all undergone hostage simulations in their special training and say they wanted to offer their recruits a similar experience in their basic training . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .

" if we had lost , schalke would have enjoyed a big lead and it was important that we did n't let them get away .

the main opposition party , the social democrats , is demanding a referendum , and the green party , which forms part of the center-right governing coalition , wants the base integrated in eu and nato defense plans . the proposed rollout of the us missile shield in central europe has split european countries .
germany has failed to open a debate about it within nato , which considers the decision a purely bilateral issue between the us and its staunch allies , the czech republic and poland . moscow has protested against the construction of a defense system installed on its doorstep . the us has offered assurances that the czech and polish bases are aimed at completing coverage from installations already in place in the united states , britain and greenland and that they are only aimed at preventing long range missile attacks from the middle east . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech village casts vote on us anti-missile defense shield residents of a tiny czech village are to vote in a local referendum on a us proposal to construct a radar station making up part of its anti-missile defense system on the neighboring jince army base .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 " fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 3 millions muslims live in germany a lack of educational opportunities and political participation is hindering the integration of muslim immigrants in germany , jonathan laurence from the international conflict group said in an interview with dw-world.de. in a report on islam and integration in germany published last week , the international crisis group said germany has made in integrating muslim immigrants , but the think tank also offered an extensive list of recommendations on what all parties can do to improve .
icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

but the us plan to base the system in eastern europe " requires discussions , " he added . " the cold war is over and we are all living under new conditions , " steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference with rice . he welcomed a remark by rice that the us is in talks with moscow to try to soothe russian misgivings .
the aim is to " avoid misunderstandings that might have unintended consequences , " steinmeier said . german parties split by missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's governing parties differ on the us missile defense plan the us is negotiating with nato members poland and czech republic , both former soviet satellites , to host ballistic missile defense components .
plans call for a radar tracking station in the czech republic and up to 10 interceptor missiles to be based in poland . the us anti-missile shield plan has divided politicians in germany 's grand coalition government .
chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia . " the more we explain , the better " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants the us to take russian concerns seriously " we live in a world where we face small nuclear threats , small potential missile threats from for instance iran , " she said .
" in that world , a limited missile defense that can deal with small threats is very much a stabilizing factor , not a destabilizing factor . " but eu leaders who met rice at the state department said russia 's objections must at least be listened to . " it is true that the russians have a hypersensitivity of having infrastructure moving to their borders , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" therefore the more we talk , the more we explain , the better . " eu to continue palestinian aid monday 's talks also addressed how the international community would respond to the newly formed palestinian government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the palestinian government needs to renounce violence the new government was officially formed over the weekend grouping the western-backed fatah part of president mahmud abbas and the radical islamic movement hamas , which israel , the us and eu consider a terrorist group . eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner , who was also in washington with solana and steinmeier , said the eu would continue its temporary aid to the new palestinian government for three months . " it is very important that at this delicate moment we at least can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to see that the palestinian people will not suffer in this period when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity government , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu ceased direct aid to the palestinian government when hamas came to power following last year 's election and subsequently set up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the palestinians . washington has criticized hamas prime minister ismail haniya for reaffirming his government 's support for " resistance " against israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the palestinian government formally recognizes israel and renounces violence . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech villagers vote against us anti-missile defense shield inhabitants of a small czech village voted overwhelmingly on saturday against us plans to construct part of its anti-missile defense system on a nearby army base .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- governing coalition partners slam us missile shield over the weekend , chancellor angela merkel 's left-of-center coalition partners sharply criticized us plans to put parts of its missile shield in europe .
they said the project could spark a new arms race .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- us says missile shield protects eu , open to nato framework the top us missile defense official sought to ease european fears about a missile shield that washington plans to deploy in two eu nations .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 " fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 3 millions muslims live in germany a lack of educational opportunities and political participation is hindering the integration of muslim immigrants in germany , jonathan laurence from the international conflict group said in an interview with dw-world.de. in a report on islam and integration in germany published last week , the international crisis group said germany has made in integrating muslim immigrants , but the think tank also offered an extensive list of recommendations on what all parties can do to improve .
icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

the new group would give a united voice to the more than three million muslims living in germany .

they said the project could spark a new arms race . politicians from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , merkel 's coalition partners , told german media over the weekend that us plans for a missile shield partly based in europe could bring back the bad old days of the cold war and its escalating arms race . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , an spd member , issued a thinly-veiled warning for washington in the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung not to try to split europe into " old " and " new " with its plans .
the terminology brought back memories of the tensions unleashed by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld when he used those very terms in describing european support for the war in iraq . spd chairman kurt beck turned up the volume further when he urged the bloc to unite against a project russia sees as an encroachment on its former sphere of influence and an attempt to shift the post-cold war balance of power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck just says no " we do n't need new missiles in europe , " beck told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
it was another echo , this time of the heated debate in germany during the late 1970s over the deployment of us pershing medium-range nuclear missiles in europe . under the current plan , the united states wants to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland by 2011 or 2012 .
it says the system is designed to counter threats from states like iran and north korea . " the spd does not want a new arms race between the usa and russia on european soil .
europe must speak with one voice on this , " beck said . their criticism of the us plan comes a day before steinmeier is due to travel to washington for talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice on issues including the middle east peace process and iran 's nuclear program . mounting concerns the hard talk also comes amid mounting unease in party ranks with germany 's military commitments abroad , notably in afghanistan , where the decision to sent tornado reconnaissance jets to that country has met with strong resistance .

parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 " fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 3 millions muslims live in germany a lack of educational opportunities and political participation is hindering the integration of muslim immigrants in germany , jonathan laurence from the international conflict group said in an interview with dw-world.de. in a report on islam and integration in germany published last week , the international crisis group said germany has made in integrating muslim immigrants , but the think tank also offered an extensive list of recommendations on what all parties can do to improve .
icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .
-lrb- 18.03.2007 -rrb- german muslims want unified voice muslim leaders in germany plan to form an umbrella organization to represent them .
the new group would give a united voice to the more than three million muslims living in germany .
-lrb- 05.03.2007 -rrb- " integration is a two-way street " stefan kramer , secretary general of the central council of jews in germany spoke to dw-world.de about the challenges of integration and dialogue between religions .

officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- politicians in berlin want parents to get the message that raising a child is a serious responsibility .
parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .
it 's still unclear whether the idea is completely legal . spd legal expert fritz felgentreu said he did n't foresee any legal problems and that only the details of the proposed plan needed to be worked out . school violence a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have been called to control school violence the issue of how to curtail juvenile delinquency and violence remains a critical one in germany 's capital city .
last spring , police took over the rütli school in the berlin suburb of neukölln .
teachers complained that violence in the school had gotten out of control .
the school is in a low-rent district with high unemployment . the school brought in social workers and school psychologists while police checked that no one brought weapons onto school property .
at the time , politicians agreed that the problems had a variety of sources , including a lack of economic opportunities . many of the students at the school are children of immigrants and do n't speak german at home . parents could face stiff fines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents need to stop problems early yet apathetic , uncooperative parents are also part of the problem , wolfgang schimmang -lrb- spd -rrb- , neukölln 's education counselor , said in an article in berlin 's der tagesspiegel saturday . " what should we do to reach uncooperative parents ? "
schimmang asked . he believes fines of 50 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 67 - $ 133 -rrb- could help .
it would motivate parents to make sure their children attend school and behave , schimmang said . long-time juvenile court judge kirsten heisig told der tagesspiegel she thought it was a good idea .
to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .
parenting classes were seen as a better option by a spokesman for the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party . a spokesperson for the green party called the idea " political nonsense , " the newspaper reported . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telling tales to combat juvenile violence reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school .

berlin ’ s education senator came under heavy criticism for refusing to close the secondary school down .
-lrb- 01.04.2006 -rrb- clamping down on child neglect one of the shocking aspects of the harrowing death of a seven-year-old girl in hamburg was the fact that hers was not an isolated case .

chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia .

" it is very important that at this delicate moment we at least can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to see that the palestinian people will not suffer in this period when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity government , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu ceased direct aid to the palestinian government when hamas came to power following last year 's election and subsequently set up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the palestinians . washington has criticized hamas prime minister ismail haniya for reaffirming his government 's support for " resistance " against israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the palestinian government formally recognizes israel and renounces violence . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech villagers vote against us anti-missile defense shield inhabitants of a small czech village voted overwhelmingly on saturday against us plans to construct part of its anti-missile defense system on a nearby army base .

to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .

" the german government can not be blackmailed , " merkel said after talks with afghan president hamid karzai in berlin .
" naturally , given the situation , we are greatly concerned .

" i hope the hostages in iraq are freed soon , but i also hope that the german commitment to peace and stability is maintained . " karzai agreed , echoing merkel by saying that terror would " have no end " if nations changed their policies according to terorrists ' demands . an opinion poll in der spiegel news magazine this week showed that 57 percent of germans believe their country should pull its troops out of afghanistan . italian hostage freed meanwhile , italian journalist daniele mastrogiacomo , held hostage in afghanistan for two weeks , has been freed , the italian foreign ministry said monday .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ?

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .

they said the project could spark a new arms race . politicians from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , merkel 's coalition partners , told german media over the weekend that us plans for a missile shield partly based in europe could bring back the bad old days of the cold war and its escalating arms race . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , an spd member , issued a thinly-veiled warning for washington in the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung not to try to split europe into " old " and " new " with its plans .
the terminology brought back memories of the tensions unleashed by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld when he used those very terms in describing european support for the war in iraq . spd chairman kurt beck turned up the volume further when he urged the bloc to unite against a project russia sees as an encroachment on its former sphere of influence and an attempt to shift the post-cold war balance of power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck just says no " we do n't need new missiles in europe , " beck told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
it was another echo , this time of the heated debate in germany during the late 1970s over the deployment of us pershing medium-range nuclear missiles in europe . under the current plan , the united states wants to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland by 2011 or 2012 .
it says the system is designed to counter threats from states like iran and north korea . " the spd does not want a new arms race between the usa and russia on european soil .
europe must speak with one voice on this , " beck said . their criticism of the us plan comes a day before steinmeier is due to travel to washington for talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice on issues including the middle east peace process and iran 's nuclear program . mounting concerns the hard talk also comes amid mounting unease in party ranks with germany 's military commitments abroad , notably in afghanistan , where the decision to sent tornado reconnaissance jets to that country has met with strong resistance .
there is also concern with merkel 's push to align germany with washington on key foreign policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant general henry obering 's pr tour did n't convince some last week the top us missile defence official , lieutenant general henry obering , was in europe trying to ease concerns on the continent about the missile shield plan . merkel , who repaired transatlantic ties after her spd predecessor gerhard schröder clashed with washington over the iraq war , has said she wants a debate on the missile shield within the nato alliance but has stopped short of criticizing the united states outright . she has expressed concerns that the row could overshadow germany 's presidency of the european union , dividing the bloc and hurting her bid to revive the european constitution . merkel is also hoping for us support for her efforts to remove transatlantic trade barriers and forge a consensus on combating climate change within the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where germany is also president . merkel was forced into a coalition with the spd after a narrow election victory in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missile shield debate in germany german politicians are getting more and more worried over the united states ’ plans for a nuclear defence shield to be installed in poland and the czech republic and probably also in the caucasus region .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- us says missile shield protects eu , open to nato framework the top us missile defense official sought to ease european fears about a missile shield that washington plans to deploy in two eu nations .
he also said the us is open to making the shield available to nato .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- europe skeptical about us missile shield plans as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .

we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

the main opposition party , the social democrats , is demanding a referendum , and the green party , which forms part of the center-right governing coalition , wants the base integrated in eu and nato defense plans . the proposed rollout of the us missile shield in central europe has split european countries .
germany has failed to open a debate about it within nato , which considers the decision a purely bilateral issue between the us and its staunch allies , the czech republic and poland . moscow has protested against the construction of a defense system installed on its doorstep . the us has offered assurances that the czech and polish bases are aimed at completing coverage from installations already in place in the united states , britain and greenland and that they are only aimed at preventing long range missile attacks from the middle east . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech village casts vote on us anti-missile defense shield residents of a tiny czech village are to vote in a local referendum on a us proposal to construct a radar station making up part of its anti-missile defense system on the neighboring jince army base .

" the german government can not be blackmailed , " merkel said after talks with afghan president hamid karzai in berlin .
" naturally , given the situation , we are greatly concerned .
we know what our commitment to the civilian rebuilding means to the afghan government and we should not be blackmailed by people who are terrorists . " hannelore krause , 61 , who is married to an iraqi doctor , and her 20-year-old son sinan , who works at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped feb .
6 . a militant islamist group in iraq called the kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- has threatened to execute the hostages unless germany pulls its soldiers out of afghanistan . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in northern afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force .

he added that it would be " many , many years " before afghanistan achieved its goals . " that time will come with hard work from the afghan people and cooperation from the international community , " karzai said , adding that germany should maintain its troops stationed in northern afghanistan . " the presence of german forces in afghanistan , the presence of aid workers from germany in afghanistan and the presence of german assistance to afghanistan has enabled our desire to be fulfilled partly , " he said . withdrawal a catastrophe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently increased the number of troops it would keep in afghanistan afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta also warned that a german withdrawal would be disastrous at a time when the country is facing a renewed taliban insurgency . " the withdrawal of the german army would be a catastrophe for the security and the democratic process in my country , " spanta told germany 's public broadcaster ard .

they will then receive a monthly bill for the total of their travel . vodafone says the " touch-points " are equipped with radio chips that transmit data to the mobile phone as they log in and out .
this ticketing information is securely stored on the phone 's sim card and can be checked even if the battery has run down . touch & travel pilot scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers can record their travel at " touch-points " the pilot project , code-named touch & travel , would be operated from october on an inter-city line between berlin and hanover and on pubic transport in the suburbs of berlin . the initial testing will involve volunteer users .
a more extensive pilot involving real passengers and covering berlin 's entire metropolitan rail and subway network is being planned for next year . touch & travel will cover both bus and train services .
there are also plans to integrate deutsche bahn 's car sharing and call-a-bike services into the system , says vodafone . db and vodafone looking to sell system on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the berlin test phase , db hopes the system will go national speaking at the cebit technology fair in hanover , germany , spokespersons for the british-based vodafone and deutsche bahn said they hoped to develop a system that would be saleable to other companies within the next year .
db planned to introduce the system nationally after the pilot phase . to participate , phones must be equipped with near field communication -lrb- nfc -rrb- modules , which are fitted in many handsets . big international phone groups have in the past tested schemes to use phones as devices to make small payments .
such systems would have made phone companies competitors to the credit-card industry , with customers settling their bills monthly with the phone company . previous mobile-phone projects were abandoned after phone companies grew concerned about the high risks and lack of profits . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon thursday on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .

but the us plan to base the system in eastern europe " requires discussions , " he added . " the cold war is over and we are all living under new conditions , " steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference with rice . he welcomed a remark by rice that the us is in talks with moscow to try to soothe russian misgivings .
the aim is to " avoid misunderstandings that might have unintended consequences , " steinmeier said . german parties split by missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's governing parties differ on the us missile defense plan the us is negotiating with nato members poland and czech republic , both former soviet satellites , to host ballistic missile defense components .
plans call for a radar tracking station in the czech republic and up to 10 interceptor missiles to be based in poland . the us anti-missile shield plan has divided politicians in germany 's grand coalition government .
chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia . " the more we explain , the better " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants the us to take russian concerns seriously " we live in a world where we face small nuclear threats , small potential missile threats from for instance iran , " she said .
" in that world , a limited missile defense that can deal with small threats is very much a stabilizing factor , not a destabilizing factor . " but eu leaders who met rice at the state department said russia 's objections must at least be listened to . " it is true that the russians have a hypersensitivity of having infrastructure moving to their borders , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" therefore the more we talk , the more we explain , the better . " eu to continue palestinian aid monday 's talks also addressed how the international community would respond to the newly formed palestinian government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the palestinian government needs to renounce violence the new government was officially formed over the weekend grouping the western-backed fatah part of president mahmud abbas and the radical islamic movement hamas , which israel , the us and eu consider a terrorist group . eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner , who was also in washington with solana and steinmeier , said the eu would continue its temporary aid to the new palestinian government for three months . " it is very important that at this delicate moment we at least can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to see that the palestinian people will not suffer in this period when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity government , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu ceased direct aid to the palestinian government when hamas came to power following last year 's election and subsequently set up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the palestinians . washington has criticized hamas prime minister ismail haniya for reaffirming his government 's support for " resistance " against israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the palestinian government formally recognizes israel and renounces violence . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech villagers vote against us anti-missile defense shield inhabitants of a small czech village voted overwhelmingly on saturday against us plans to construct part of its anti-missile defense system on a nearby army base .

they will then receive a monthly bill for the total of their travel . vodafone says the " touch-points " are equipped with radio chips that transmit data to the mobile phone as they log in and out .
this ticketing information is securely stored on the phone 's sim card and can be checked even if the battery has run down . touch & travel pilot scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers can record their travel at " touch-points " the pilot project , code-named touch & travel , would be operated from october on an inter-city line between berlin and hanover and on pubic transport in the suburbs of berlin . the initial testing will involve volunteer users .
a more extensive pilot involving real passengers and covering berlin 's entire metropolitan rail and subway network is being planned for next year . touch & travel will cover both bus and train services .
there are also plans to integrate deutsche bahn 's car sharing and call-a-bike services into the system , says vodafone . db and vodafone looking to sell system on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the berlin test phase , db hopes the system will go national speaking at the cebit technology fair in hanover , germany , spokespersons for the british-based vodafone and deutsche bahn said they hoped to develop a system that would be saleable to other companies within the next year .
db planned to introduce the system nationally after the pilot phase . to participate , phones must be equipped with near field communication -lrb- nfc -rrb- modules , which are fitted in many handsets . big international phone groups have in the past tested schemes to use phones as devices to make small payments .
such systems would have made phone companies competitors to the credit-card industry , with customers settling their bills monthly with the phone company . previous mobile-phone projects were abandoned after phone companies grew concerned about the high risks and lack of profits . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon thursday on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .

" it is very important that at this delicate moment we at least can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to see that the palestinian people will not suffer in this period when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity government , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu ceased direct aid to the palestinian government when hamas came to power following last year 's election and subsequently set up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the palestinians . washington has criticized hamas prime minister ismail haniya for reaffirming his government 's support for " resistance " against israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the palestinian government formally recognizes israel and renounces violence . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech villagers vote against us anti-missile defense shield inhabitants of a small czech village voted overwhelmingly on saturday against us plans to construct part of its anti-missile defense system on a nearby army base .

but the us plan to base the system in eastern europe " requires discussions , " he added . " the cold war is over and we are all living under new conditions , " steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference with rice . he welcomed a remark by rice that the us is in talks with moscow to try to soothe russian misgivings .
the aim is to " avoid misunderstandings that might have unintended consequences , " steinmeier said . german parties split by missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's governing parties differ on the us missile defense plan the us is negotiating with nato members poland and czech republic , both former soviet satellites , to host ballistic missile defense components .
plans call for a radar tracking station in the czech republic and up to 10 interceptor missiles to be based in poland . the us anti-missile shield plan has divided politicians in germany 's grand coalition government .
chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia . " the more we explain , the better " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants the us to take russian concerns seriously " we live in a world where we face small nuclear threats , small potential missile threats from for instance iran , " she said .
" in that world , a limited missile defense that can deal with small threats is very much a stabilizing factor , not a destabilizing factor . " but eu leaders who met rice at the state department said russia 's objections must at least be listened to . " it is true that the russians have a hypersensitivity of having infrastructure moving to their borders , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" therefore the more we talk , the more we explain , the better . " eu to continue palestinian aid monday 's talks also addressed how the international community would respond to the newly formed palestinian government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the palestinian government needs to renounce violence the new government was officially formed over the weekend grouping the western-backed fatah part of president mahmud abbas and the radical islamic movement hamas , which israel , the us and eu consider a terrorist group . eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner , who was also in washington with solana and steinmeier , said the eu would continue its temporary aid to the new palestinian government for three months .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ? "
struck asked . according to the prosecutor 's office , all of the accused officers have served abroad , either in afghanistan or the balkans .
they had all undergone hostage simulations in their special training and say they wanted to offer their recruits a similar experience in their basic training . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ?

" the german government can not be blackmailed , " merkel said after talks with afghan president hamid karzai in berlin .
" naturally , given the situation , we are greatly concerned .
we know what our commitment to the civilian rebuilding means to the afghan government and we should not be blackmailed by people who are terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 governing coalition partners slam us missile shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians fear a new arms race if the us plans go ahead over the weekend , chancellor angela merkel 's left-of-center coalition partners sharply criticized us plans to put parts of its missile shield in europe .
they said the project could spark a new arms race . politicians from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , merkel 's coalition partners , told german media over the weekend that us plans for a missile shield partly based in europe could bring back the bad old days of the cold war and its escalating arms race . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , an spd member , issued a thinly-veiled warning for washington in the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung not to try to split europe into " old " and " new " with its plans .
the terminology brought back memories of the tensions unleashed by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld when he used those very terms in describing european support for the war in iraq . spd chairman kurt beck turned up the volume further when he urged the bloc to unite against a project russia sees as an encroachment on its former sphere of influence and an attempt to shift the post-cold war balance of power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck just says no " we do n't need new missiles in europe , " beck told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
it was another echo , this time of the heated debate in germany during the late 1970s over the deployment of us pershing medium-range nuclear missiles in europe . under the current plan , the united states wants to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland by 2011 or 2012 .
it says the system is designed to counter threats from states like iran and north korea . " the spd does not want a new arms race between the usa and russia on european soil .
europe must speak with one voice on this , " beck said . their criticism of the us plan comes a day before steinmeier is due to travel to washington for talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice on issues including the middle east peace process and iran 's nuclear program . mounting concerns the hard talk also comes amid mounting unease in party ranks with germany 's military commitments abroad , notably in afghanistan , where the decision to sent tornado reconnaissance jets to that country has met with strong resistance .
there is also concern with merkel 's push to align germany with washington on key foreign policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant general henry obering 's pr tour did n't convince some last week the top us missile defence official , lieutenant general henry obering , was in europe trying to ease concerns on the continent about the missile shield plan . merkel , who repaired transatlantic ties after her spd predecessor gerhard schröder clashed with washington over the iraq war , has said she wants a debate on the missile shield within the nato alliance but has stopped short of criticizing the united states outright . she has expressed concerns that the row could overshadow germany 's presidency of the european union , dividing the bloc and hurting her bid to revive the european constitution . merkel is also hoping for us support for her efforts to remove transatlantic trade barriers and forge a consensus on combating climate change within the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where germany is also president . merkel was forced into a coalition with the spd after a narrow election victory in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missile shield debate in germany german politicians are getting more and more worried over the united states ’ plans for a nuclear defence shield to be installed in poland and the czech republic and probably also in the caucasus region .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- us says missile shield protects eu , open to nato framework the top us missile defense official sought to ease european fears about a missile shield that washington plans to deploy in two eu nations .
he also said the us is open to making the shield available to nato .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- europe skeptical about us missile shield plans as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 governing coalition partners slam us missile shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians fear a new arms race if the us plans go ahead over the weekend , chancellor angela merkel 's left-of-center coalition partners sharply criticized us plans to put parts of its missile shield in europe .
they said the project could spark a new arms race . politicians from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , merkel 's coalition partners , told german media over the weekend that us plans for a missile shield partly based in europe could bring back the bad old days of the cold war and its escalating arms race . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , an spd member , issued a thinly-veiled warning for washington in the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung not to try to split europe into " old " and " new " with its plans .
the terminology brought back memories of the tensions unleashed by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld when he used those very terms in describing european support for the war in iraq . spd chairman kurt beck turned up the volume further when he urged the bloc to unite against a project russia sees as an encroachment on its former sphere of influence and an attempt to shift the post-cold war balance of power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck just says no " we do n't need new missiles in europe , " beck told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
it was another echo , this time of the heated debate in germany during the late 1970s over the deployment of us pershing medium-range nuclear missiles in europe . under the current plan , the united states wants to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland by 2011 or 2012 .
it says the system is designed to counter threats from states like iran and north korea . " the spd does not want a new arms race between the usa and russia on european soil .
europe must speak with one voice on this , " beck said . their criticism of the us plan comes a day before steinmeier is due to travel to washington for talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice on issues including the middle east peace process and iran 's nuclear program . mounting concerns the hard talk also comes amid mounting unease in party ranks with germany 's military commitments abroad , notably in afghanistan , where the decision to sent tornado reconnaissance jets to that country has met with strong resistance .
there is also concern with merkel 's push to align germany with washington on key foreign policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant general henry obering 's pr tour did n't convince some last week the top us missile defence official , lieutenant general henry obering , was in europe trying to ease concerns on the continent about the missile shield plan . merkel , who repaired transatlantic ties after her spd predecessor gerhard schröder clashed with washington over the iraq war , has said she wants a debate on the missile shield within the nato alliance but has stopped short of criticizing the united states outright . she has expressed concerns that the row could overshadow germany 's presidency of the european union , dividing the bloc and hurting her bid to revive the european constitution . merkel is also hoping for us support for her efforts to remove transatlantic trade barriers and forge a consensus on combating climate change within the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where germany is also president . merkel was forced into a coalition with the spd after a narrow election victory in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missile shield debate in germany german politicians are getting more and more worried over the united states ’ plans for a nuclear defence shield to be installed in poland and the czech republic and probably also in the caucasus region .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- us says missile shield protects eu , open to nato framework the top us missile defense official sought to ease european fears about a missile shield that washington plans to deploy in two eu nations .
he also said the us is open to making the shield available to nato .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- europe skeptical about us missile shield plans as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good .

officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- politicians in berlin want parents to get the message that raising a child is a serious responsibility .
parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .
it 's still unclear whether the idea is completely legal . spd legal expert fritz felgentreu said he did n't foresee any legal problems and that only the details of the proposed plan needed to be worked out . school violence a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have been called to control school violence the issue of how to curtail juvenile delinquency and violence remains a critical one in germany 's capital city .
last spring , police took over the rütli school in the berlin suburb of neukölln .
teachers complained that violence in the school had gotten out of control .
the school is in a low-rent district with high unemployment . the school brought in social workers and school psychologists while police checked that no one brought weapons onto school property .
at the time , politicians agreed that the problems had a variety of sources , including a lack of economic opportunities . many of the students at the school are children of immigrants and do n't speak german at home . parents could face stiff fines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents need to stop problems early yet apathetic , uncooperative parents are also part of the problem , wolfgang schimmang -lrb- spd -rrb- , neukölln 's education counselor , said in an article in berlin 's der tagesspiegel saturday . " what should we do to reach uncooperative parents ? "
schimmang asked . he believes fines of 50 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 67 - $ 133 -rrb- could help .
it would motivate parents to make sure their children attend school and behave , schimmang said . long-time juvenile court judge kirsten heisig told der tagesspiegel she thought it was a good idea .
to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .
parenting classes were seen as a better option by a spokesman for the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party . a spokesperson for the green party called the idea " political nonsense , " the newspaper reported . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telling tales to combat juvenile violence reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school .

" i hope the hostages in iraq are freed soon , but i also hope that the german commitment to peace and stability is maintained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 governing coalition partners slam us missile shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians fear a new arms race if the us plans go ahead over the weekend , chancellor angela merkel 's left-of-center coalition partners sharply criticized us plans to put parts of its missile shield in europe .
they said the project could spark a new arms race . politicians from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , merkel 's coalition partners , told german media over the weekend that us plans for a missile shield partly based in europe could bring back the bad old days of the cold war and its escalating arms race . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , an spd member , issued a thinly-veiled warning for washington in the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung not to try to split europe into " old " and " new " with its plans .
the terminology brought back memories of the tensions unleashed by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld when he used those very terms in describing european support for the war in iraq . spd chairman kurt beck turned up the volume further when he urged the bloc to unite against a project russia sees as an encroachment on its former sphere of influence and an attempt to shift the post-cold war balance of power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck just says no " we do n't need new missiles in europe , " beck told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
it was another echo , this time of the heated debate in germany during the late 1970s over the deployment of us pershing medium-range nuclear missiles in europe . under the current plan , the united states wants to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland by 2011 or 2012 .
it says the system is designed to counter threats from states like iran and north korea . " the spd does not want a new arms race between the usa and russia on european soil .
europe must speak with one voice on this , " beck said . their criticism of the us plan comes a day before steinmeier is due to travel to washington for talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice on issues including the middle east peace process and iran 's nuclear program . mounting concerns the hard talk also comes amid mounting unease in party ranks with germany 's military commitments abroad , notably in afghanistan , where the decision to sent tornado reconnaissance jets to that country has met with strong resistance .
there is also concern with merkel 's push to align germany with washington on key foreign policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant general henry obering 's pr tour did n't convince some last week the top us missile defence official , lieutenant general henry obering , was in europe trying to ease concerns on the continent about the missile shield plan . merkel , who repaired transatlantic ties after her spd predecessor gerhard schröder clashed with washington over the iraq war , has said she wants a debate on the missile shield within the nato alliance but has stopped short of criticizing the united states outright . she has expressed concerns that the row could overshadow germany 's presidency of the european union , dividing the bloc and hurting her bid to revive the european constitution . merkel is also hoping for us support for her efforts to remove transatlantic trade barriers and forge a consensus on combating climate change within the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where germany is also president . merkel was forced into a coalition with the spd after a narrow election victory in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missile shield debate in germany german politicians are getting more and more worried over the united states ’ plans for a nuclear defence shield to be installed in poland and the czech republic and probably also in the caucasus region .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- us says missile shield protects eu , open to nato framework the top us missile defense official sought to ease european fears about a missile shield that washington plans to deploy in two eu nations .
he also said the us is open to making the shield available to nato .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- europe skeptical about us missile shield plans as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good .

but the us plan to base the system in eastern europe " requires discussions , " he added . " the cold war is over and we are all living under new conditions , " steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference with rice . he welcomed a remark by rice that the us is in talks with moscow to try to soothe russian misgivings .
the aim is to " avoid misunderstandings that might have unintended consequences , " steinmeier said . german parties split by missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's governing parties differ on the us missile defense plan the us is negotiating with nato members poland and czech republic , both former soviet satellites , to host ballistic missile defense components .
plans call for a radar tracking station in the czech republic and up to 10 interceptor missiles to be based in poland . the us anti-missile shield plan has divided politicians in germany 's grand coalition government .
chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia . " the more we explain , the better " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants the us to take russian concerns seriously " we live in a world where we face small nuclear threats , small potential missile threats from for instance iran , " she said .
" in that world , a limited missile defense that can deal with small threats is very much a stabilizing factor , not a destabilizing factor . " but eu leaders who met rice at the state department said russia 's objections must at least be listened to . " it is true that the russians have a hypersensitivity of having infrastructure moving to their borders , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" therefore the more we talk , the more we explain , the better .

" it is very important that at this delicate moment we at least can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to see that the palestinian people will not suffer in this period when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity government , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu ceased direct aid to the palestinian government when hamas came to power following last year 's election and subsequently set up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the palestinians . washington has criticized hamas prime minister ismail haniya for reaffirming his government 's support for " resistance " against israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the palestinian government formally recognizes israel and renounces violence . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech villagers vote against us anti-missile defense shield inhabitants of a small czech village voted overwhelmingly on saturday against us plans to construct part of its anti-missile defense system on a nearby army base .

schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt . werder bremen coach thomas schaaf was a relieved man after his title-chasing side 's 2-0 win over mainz 05 on sunday kept the pressure on bundesliga leaders schalke 04 . goals by midfielders jurica vranjes and diego helped second-placed bremen peg the leaders back to a three-point advantage as schalke had briefly opened a six-point lead after saturday 's win over third-placed stuttgart . centre half vranjes gave bremen the lead on the hour mark when he took a slick pass on the edge of the area and smashed his shot past mainz 's diving goalkeeper dimo wache . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's 2-0 win keeps them in the title hunt and bremen made sure of the points in injury time when brazilian diego broke clear of the defense after a quick counter-attack and chipped into an empty net as mainz 's defense was exposed for chasing an equalizing goal . " this was a key win for us , " said bremen coach schaaf .
" if we had lost , schalke would have enjoyed a big lead and it was important that we did n't let them get away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 bundeswehr officials in court over brutal hazing of recruits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military trainers are accused of abusing over 80 bundeswehr recruits during 2004 eighteen training officials from the german military are in court monday charged with the abuse of recruits .
they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ? "
struck asked . according to the prosecutor 's office , all of the accused officers have served abroad , either in afghanistan or the balkans .
they had all undergone hostage simulations in their special training and say they wanted to offer their recruits a similar experience in their basic training . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ? "
struck asked . according to the prosecutor 's office , all of the accused officers have served abroad , either in afghanistan or the balkans .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ? "
struck asked . according to the prosecutor 's office , all of the accused officers have served abroad , either in afghanistan or the balkans .
they had all undergone hostage simulations in their special training and say they wanted to offer their recruits a similar experience in their basic training . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .
-lrb- 27.10.2006 -rrb- 18 soldiers indicted in hazing case eighteen german soldiers were indicted monday in the wake of a scandal surrounding the alleged abuse of more than 160 military recruits , using electrical shocks and beatings .
-lrb- 21.06.2005 -rrb- when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence .
-lrb- 08.12.2004 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic 18 bundeswehr soldiers have been accused of abusing recruits feedback have deployments in conflict zones led to a new culture of brutality in the bundeswehr or other armies ?

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia .

but the us plan to base the system in eastern europe " requires discussions , " he added . " the cold war is over and we are all living under new conditions , " steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference with rice . he welcomed a remark by rice that the us is in talks with moscow to try to soothe russian misgivings .
the aim is to " avoid misunderstandings that might have unintended consequences , " steinmeier said . german parties split by missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's governing parties differ on the us missile defense plan the us is negotiating with nato members poland and czech republic , both former soviet satellites , to host ballistic missile defense components .
plans call for a radar tracking station in the czech republic and up to 10 interceptor missiles to be based in poland . the us anti-missile shield plan has divided politicians in germany 's grand coalition government .
chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia . " the more we explain , the better " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants the us to take russian concerns seriously " we live in a world where we face small nuclear threats , small potential missile threats from for instance iran , " she said .
" in that world , a limited missile defense that can deal with small threats is very much a stabilizing factor , not a destabilizing factor . " but eu leaders who met rice at the state department said russia 's objections must at least be listened to . " it is true that the russians have a hypersensitivity of having infrastructure moving to their borders , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" therefore the more we talk , the more we explain , the better . " eu to continue palestinian aid monday 's talks also addressed how the international community would respond to the newly formed palestinian government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the palestinian government needs to renounce violence the new government was officially formed over the weekend grouping the western-backed fatah part of president mahmud abbas and the radical islamic movement hamas , which israel , the us and eu consider a terrorist group . eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner , who was also in washington with solana and steinmeier , said the eu would continue its temporary aid to the new palestinian government for three months . " it is very important that at this delicate moment we at least can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to see that the palestinian people will not suffer in this period when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity government , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu ceased direct aid to the palestinian government when hamas came to power following last year 's election and subsequently set up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the palestinians . washington has criticized hamas prime minister ismail haniya for reaffirming his government 's support for " resistance " against israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the palestinian government formally recognizes israel and renounces violence . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech villagers vote against us anti-missile defense shield inhabitants of a small czech village voted overwhelmingly on saturday against us plans to construct part of its anti-missile defense system on a nearby army base .

officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- politicians in berlin want parents to get the message that raising a child is a serious responsibility .
parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .
it 's still unclear whether the idea is completely legal . spd legal expert fritz felgentreu said he did n't foresee any legal problems and that only the details of the proposed plan needed to be worked out . school violence a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have been called to control school violence the issue of how to curtail juvenile delinquency and violence remains a critical one in germany 's capital city .
last spring , police took over the rütli school in the berlin suburb of neukölln .
teachers complained that violence in the school had gotten out of control .
the school is in a low-rent district with high unemployment . the school brought in social workers and school psychologists while police checked that no one brought weapons onto school property .
at the time , politicians agreed that the problems had a variety of sources , including a lack of economic opportunities . many of the students at the school are children of immigrants and do n't speak german at home . parents could face stiff fines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents need to stop problems early yet apathetic , uncooperative parents are also part of the problem , wolfgang schimmang -lrb- spd -rrb- , neukölln 's education counselor , said in an article in berlin 's der tagesspiegel saturday . " what should we do to reach uncooperative parents ? "
schimmang asked . he believes fines of 50 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 67 - $ 133 -rrb- could help .
it would motivate parents to make sure their children attend school and behave , schimmang said . long-time juvenile court judge kirsten heisig told der tagesspiegel she thought it was a good idea .
to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .
parenting classes were seen as a better option by a spokesman for the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party . a spokesperson for the green party called the idea " political nonsense , " the newspaper reported . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telling tales to combat juvenile violence reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school .

they will then receive a monthly bill for the total of their travel . vodafone says the " touch-points " are equipped with radio chips that transmit data to the mobile phone as they log in and out .

a more extensive pilot involving real passengers and covering berlin 's entire metropolitan rail and subway network is being planned for next year . touch & travel will cover both bus and train services .

db planned to introduce the system nationally after the pilot phase . to participate , phones must be equipped with near field communication -lrb- nfc -rrb- modules , which are fitted in many handsets . big international phone groups have in the past tested schemes to use phones as devices to make small payments .
such systems would have made phone companies competitors to the credit-card industry , with customers settling their bills monthly with the phone company . previous mobile-phone projects were abandoned after phone companies grew concerned about the high risks and lack of profits . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon thursday on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 " fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 3 millions muslims live in germany a lack of educational opportunities and political participation is hindering the integration of muslim immigrants in germany , jonathan laurence from the international conflict group said in an interview with dw-world.de. in a report on islam and integration in germany published last week , the international crisis group said germany has made in integrating muslim immigrants , but the think tank also offered an extensive list of recommendations on what all parties can do to improve .
icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

" we have nothing against the americans , " said trokavec resident ladislav straka .
" if it were the russians or the japanese , it would be the same .
we do n't want it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech radar would detect missiles , which would then be shot down over poland milena huskova , a 52-year-old labrador breeder , was also against the plan . " the radar can have a negative impact on us , on the animals and on nature , so we do n't want it , " huskova said . politics parties divided according to a survey by the czech-based public opinion research center -lrb- cvvm -rrb- in march , around six out of 10 czechs are opposed to hosting the x-band radar , which is designed to detect a missile attack . ten interceptor missiles , to be based in poland , would shoot the missiles out of the sky . on the political level , the country 's strong communist party has led attacks on the proposed radar .
the main opposition party , the social democrats , is demanding a referendum , and the green party , which forms part of the center-right governing coalition , wants the base integrated in eu and nato defense plans . the proposed rollout of the us missile shield in central europe has split european countries .
germany has failed to open a debate about it within nato , which considers the decision a purely bilateral issue between the us and its staunch allies , the czech republic and poland . moscow has protested against the construction of a defense system installed on its doorstep . the us has offered assurances that the czech and polish bases are aimed at completing coverage from installations already in place in the united states , britain and greenland and that they are only aimed at preventing long range missile attacks from the middle east . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech village casts vote on us anti-missile defense shield residents of a tiny czech village are to vote in a local referendum on a us proposal to construct a radar station making up part of its anti-missile defense system on the neighboring jince army base .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ?

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ? "
struck asked . according to the prosecutor 's office , all of the accused officers have served abroad , either in afghanistan or the balkans .
they had all undergone hostage simulations in their special training and say they wanted to offer their recruits a similar experience in their basic training . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 " fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 3 millions muslims live in germany a lack of educational opportunities and political participation is hindering the integration of muslim immigrants in germany , jonathan laurence from the international conflict group said in an interview with dw-world.de. in a report on islam and integration in germany published last week , the international crisis group said germany has made in integrating muslim immigrants , but the think tank also offered an extensive list of recommendations on what all parties can do to improve .
icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .
-lrb- 18.03.2007 -rrb- german muslims want unified voice muslim leaders in germany plan to form an umbrella organization to represent them .
the new group would give a united voice to the more than three million muslims living in germany .
-lrb- 05.03.2007 -rrb- " integration is a two-way street " stefan kramer , secretary general of the central council of jews in germany spoke to dw-world.de about the challenges of integration and dialogue between religions .

officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- politicians in berlin want parents to get the message that raising a child is a serious responsibility .
parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .
it 's still unclear whether the idea is completely legal . spd legal expert fritz felgentreu said he did n't foresee any legal problems and that only the details of the proposed plan needed to be worked out . school violence a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have been called to control school violence the issue of how to curtail juvenile delinquency and violence remains a critical one in germany 's capital city .
last spring , police took over the rütli school in the berlin suburb of neukölln .
teachers complained that violence in the school had gotten out of control .
the school is in a low-rent district with high unemployment . the school brought in social workers and school psychologists while police checked that no one brought weapons onto school property .
at the time , politicians agreed that the problems had a variety of sources , including a lack of economic opportunities . many of the students at the school are children of immigrants and do n't speak german at home . parents could face stiff fines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents need to stop problems early yet apathetic , uncooperative parents are also part of the problem , wolfgang schimmang -lrb- spd -rrb- , neukölln 's education counselor , said in an article in berlin 's der tagesspiegel saturday . " what should we do to reach uncooperative parents ? "
schimmang asked . he believes fines of 50 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 67 - $ 133 -rrb- could help .
it would motivate parents to make sure their children attend school and behave , schimmang said . long-time juvenile court judge kirsten heisig told der tagesspiegel she thought it was a good idea .
to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .
parenting classes were seen as a better option by a spokesman for the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party . a spokesperson for the green party called the idea " political nonsense , " the newspaper reported . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telling tales to combat juvenile violence reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school .

-lrb- 01.04.2006 -rrb- clamping down on child neglect one of the shocking aspects of the harrowing death of a seven-year-old girl in hamburg was the fact that hers was not an isolated case .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .
-lrb- 18.03.2007 -rrb- german muslims want unified voice muslim leaders in germany plan to form an umbrella organization to represent them .
the new group would give a united voice to the more than three million muslims living in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents share the blame for misbehaving children parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .
officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- politicians in berlin want parents to get the message that raising a child is a serious responsibility .
parents deserve punishment when their children skip school or break the law , they suggested . michael müller , the spd head in berlin , has proposed handing out fines to overly-permissive parents as a way to get their attention . his proposal received support from other members of his party as well as from some opposition leaders and youth advocates .
it 's still unclear whether the idea is completely legal . spd legal expert fritz felgentreu said he did n't foresee any legal problems and that only the details of the proposed plan needed to be worked out . school violence a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have been called to control school violence the issue of how to curtail juvenile delinquency and violence remains a critical one in germany 's capital city .
last spring , police took over the rütli school in the berlin suburb of neukölln .
teachers complained that violence in the school had gotten out of control .
the school is in a low-rent district with high unemployment . the school brought in social workers and school psychologists while police checked that no one brought weapons onto school property .
at the time , politicians agreed that the problems had a variety of sources , including a lack of economic opportunities . many of the students at the school are children of immigrants and do n't speak german at home . parents could face stiff fines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents need to stop problems early yet apathetic , uncooperative parents are also part of the problem , wolfgang schimmang -lrb- spd -rrb- , neukölln 's education counselor , said in an article in berlin 's der tagesspiegel saturday . " what should we do to reach uncooperative parents ? "
schimmang asked . he believes fines of 50 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 67 - $ 133 -rrb- could help .
it would motivate parents to make sure their children attend school and behave , schimmang said . long-time juvenile court judge kirsten heisig told der tagesspiegel she thought it was a good idea .
to prevent children from forming criminal habits that will follow them into adulthood , parents must intervene early , heisig and colleagues have been saying for months .
many young criminals have already become frequent truants in grade school . pressure is needed to get this message through to parents , heisig said . politicians from other parties said the proposal would punish parents who already have financial problems .
parenting classes were seen as a better option by a spokesman for the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party . a spokesperson for the green party called the idea " political nonsense , " the newspaper reported . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telling tales to combat juvenile violence reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school .
-lrb- 25.04.2006 -rrb- no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers said was out of control .
berlin ’ s education senator came under heavy criticism for refusing to close the secondary school down .

but the us plan to base the system in eastern europe " requires discussions , " he added . " the cold war is over and we are all living under new conditions , " steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference with rice . he welcomed a remark by rice that the us is in talks with moscow to try to soothe russian misgivings .
the aim is to " avoid misunderstandings that might have unintended consequences , " steinmeier said . german parties split by missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's governing parties differ on the us missile defense plan the us is negotiating with nato members poland and czech republic , both former soviet satellites , to host ballistic missile defense components .
plans call for a radar tracking station in the czech republic and up to 10 interceptor missiles to be based in poland . the us anti-missile shield plan has divided politicians in germany 's grand coalition government .
chancellor angela merkel has said that nato should be responsible for handling the issue while kurt beck , head of the social democratic party with which she governs , said the proposal could spark a news arms race . the us , however , maintains that the plan is designed to counter threats from countries such as iran or north korea and would pose no threat to russia . " the more we explain , the better " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants the us to take russian concerns seriously " we live in a world where we face small nuclear threats , small potential missile threats from for instance iran , " she said .
" in that world , a limited missile defense that can deal with small threats is very much a stabilizing factor , not a destabilizing factor . " but eu leaders who met rice at the state department said russia 's objections must at least be listened to . " it is true that the russians have a hypersensitivity of having infrastructure moving to their borders , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" therefore the more we talk , the more we explain , the better . " eu to continue palestinian aid monday 's talks also addressed how the international community would respond to the newly formed palestinian government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the palestinian government needs to renounce violence the new government was officially formed over the weekend grouping the western-backed fatah part of president mahmud abbas and the radical islamic movement hamas , which israel , the us and eu consider a terrorist group . eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner , who was also in washington with solana and steinmeier , said the eu would continue its temporary aid to the new palestinian government for three months . " it is very important that at this delicate moment we at least can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to see that the palestinian people will not suffer in this period when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity government , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu ceased direct aid to the palestinian government when hamas came to power following last year 's election and subsequently set up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the palestinians . washington has criticized hamas prime minister ismail haniya for reaffirming his government 's support for " resistance " against israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the palestinian government formally recognizes israel and renounces violence . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech villagers vote against us anti-missile defense shield inhabitants of a small czech village voted overwhelmingly on saturday against us plans to construct part of its anti-missile defense system on a nearby army base .

they could each face jail sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty of mistreating over 80 soldiers in 2004 . details of the alleged abuse came to light more or less by chance .
a junior soldier sat down for a coffee break with his new unit and casually told some stories about his time in basic training .
his tales shocked one of his superiors who immediately passed the information on to the public prosecution office . " what happened was that a night operation was set up , " wolfgang schweer , the senior prosecutor for the court case , explained .
" the drill sergeants of the company ambushed , overwhelmed and chained up the cadets - and took them into the barracks .
there , some of the manacled soldiers were made to kneel down .
then , boot bags were put on their heads , so that they could n't see a thing .
apparently they were also sprayed with water , and as i understand it , a field radio was used to subject one soldier to electric shocks . " according to the prosecutor 's office , other soldiers had to carry tree trunks , or walk after their feet had been rubbed raw , until they could take no more . apparently the accused , a captain and 17 drill sergeants from the training barracks at the coesfeld camp in northwestern germany , took it upon themselves to subject their recruits to such treatment . extreme training for special forces only bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainees at the coesfeld camp were allegedly electrocuted the german military 's training rules do not allow simulated hostage situations under normal circumstances .
even soldiers who are selected for dangerous service abroad should only undergo such training in special centers , and always under the supervision of a psychologist . the bundeswehr prides itself as an army based on democratic principles .
what this means in practice is that military orders are not to be obeyed without question .
unlike in other armies , german soldiers should not carry out an order from a senior officer if it represents a violation of human rights . " we need to make all soldiers - at every level - strong enough , so that they are prepared to resist when their dignity or rights are attacked without good reason , " said rolf pappen from the internal affairs office of the bundeswehr .
" i expect that from any german citizen .
but i expect that most of all from our citizens in uniform - who are meant to put their own lives on the line when necessary , so as to protect the fundamental rights of other people . " the 18 training officers now facing charges have all been suspended from service .
but it is far from certain that the trial will lead to convictions , even though the prosecutor 's office is threatening the men with up to 10 years behind bars . previous trial collapsed on technicalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadets are given a code word to stop hazing tactics the men have already been tried in a local court , and two details led to that trial 's collapse : the accused claimed that their cadets could have stopped the exercise at any time by saying a particular code word , and apparently most of the cadets described the experience as the " high-point of their training . "
but the officers now have to defend themselves for a further 45 days in court . against the backdrop of photos appearing last year of german soldiers showing little respect for skulls they found in afghanistan , and other comparable incidents , critics are warning that the german military is becoming more brutal , perhaps because of increasing service abroad . former defense minister peter struck has also voiced concerns that this could be the case .
" has the fact that our army has to deal with threats like hostage taking and brutal treatment from enemies like the taliban and al qaeda brought about this situation ? " he recently asked in a bundestag debate . ex-minister fears a change in culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german defense minister peter struck " has this fact changed the awareness of the bundeswehr so much , that some soldiers who have either experienced this or been afraid that it could happen while serving abroad , have actually started simulating these situations here at home ? "
struck asked . according to the prosecutor 's office , all of the accused officers have served abroad , either in afghanistan or the balkans .

" we have nothing against the americans , " said trokavec resident ladislav straka .
" if it were the russians or the japanese , it would be the same .
we do n't want it .

the main opposition party , the social democrats , is demanding a referendum , and the green party , which forms part of the center-right governing coalition , wants the base integrated in eu and nato defense plans . the proposed rollout of the us missile shield in central europe has split european countries .
germany has failed to open a debate about it within nato , which considers the decision a purely bilateral issue between the us and its staunch allies , the czech republic and poland . moscow has protested against the construction of a defense system installed on its doorstep . the us has offered assurances that the czech and polish bases are aimed at completing coverage from installations already in place in the united states , britain and greenland and that they are only aimed at preventing long range missile attacks from the middle east . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech village casts vote on us anti-missile defense shield residents of a tiny czech village are to vote in a local referendum on a us proposal to construct a radar station making up part of its anti-missile defense system on the neighboring jince army base .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

the terminology brought back memories of the tensions unleashed by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld when he used those very terms in describing european support for the war in iraq . spd chairman kurt beck turned up the volume further when he urged the bloc to unite against a project russia sees as an encroachment on its former sphere of influence and an attempt to shift the post-cold war balance of power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck just says no " we do n't need new missiles in europe , " beck told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
it was another echo , this time of the heated debate in germany during the late 1970s over the deployment of us pershing medium-range nuclear missiles in europe . under the current plan , the united states wants to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland by 2011 or 2012 .
it says the system is designed to counter threats from states like iran and north korea . " the spd does not want a new arms race between the usa and russia on european soil .
europe must speak with one voice on this , " beck said . their criticism of the us plan comes a day before steinmeier is due to travel to washington for talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice on issues including the middle east peace process and iran 's nuclear program . mounting concerns the hard talk also comes amid mounting unease in party ranks with germany 's military commitments abroad , notably in afghanistan , where the decision to sent tornado reconnaissance jets to that country has met with strong resistance .
there is also concern with merkel 's push to align germany with washington on key foreign policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant general henry obering 's pr tour did n't convince some last week the top us missile defence official , lieutenant general henry obering , was in europe trying to ease concerns on the continent about the missile shield plan . merkel , who repaired transatlantic ties after her spd predecessor gerhard schröder clashed with washington over the iraq war , has said she wants a debate on the missile shield within the nato alliance but has stopped short of criticizing the united states outright . she has expressed concerns that the row could overshadow germany 's presidency of the european union , dividing the bloc and hurting her bid to revive the european constitution . merkel is also hoping for us support for her efforts to remove transatlantic trade barriers and forge a consensus on combating climate change within the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where germany is also president . merkel was forced into a coalition with the spd after a narrow election victory in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missile shield debate in germany german politicians are getting more and more worried over the united states ’ plans for a nuclear defence shield to be installed in poland and the czech republic and probably also in the caucasus region .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- us says missile shield protects eu , open to nato framework the top us missile defense official sought to ease european fears about a missile shield that washington plans to deploy in two eu nations .
he also said the us is open to making the shield available to nato .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- europe skeptical about us missile shield plans as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

" we have nothing against the americans , " said trokavec resident ladislav straka .
" if it were the russians or the japanese , it would be the same .
we do n't want it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech radar would detect missiles , which would then be shot down over poland milena huskova , a 52-year-old labrador breeder , was also against the plan . " the radar can have a negative impact on us , on the animals and on nature , so we do n't want it , " huskova said . politics parties divided according to a survey by the czech-based public opinion research center -lrb- cvvm -rrb- in march , around six out of 10 czechs are opposed to hosting the x-band radar , which is designed to detect a missile attack . ten interceptor missiles , to be based in poland , would shoot the missiles out of the sky . on the political level , the country 's strong communist party has led attacks on the proposed radar .
the main opposition party , the social democrats , is demanding a referendum , and the green party , which forms part of the center-right governing coalition , wants the base integrated in eu and nato defense plans . the proposed rollout of the us missile shield in central europe has split european countries .
germany has failed to open a debate about it within nato , which considers the decision a purely bilateral issue between the us and its staunch allies , the czech republic and poland . moscow has protested against the construction of a defense system installed on its doorstep . the us has offered assurances that the czech and polish bases are aimed at completing coverage from installations already in place in the united states , britain and greenland and that they are only aimed at preventing long range missile attacks from the middle east . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech village casts vote on us anti-missile defense shield residents of a tiny czech village are to vote in a local referendum on a us proposal to construct a radar station making up part of its anti-missile defense system on the neighboring jince army base .
-lrb- 17.03.2007 -rrb- europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .
experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky .
-lrb- 20.02.2007 -rrb- new czech government may be short-lived after three months of standstill , a new conservative government has been appointed in prague .
but with an impending vote of confidence for the minority party and possible early elections , uncertainty remains .

icg consultant jonathan laurence told dw-world.de about germany 's major hurdles to integrating foreigners and how they can be overcome . dw-world.de : what are the current main barriers hindering the successful integration of muslim immigrants in german society ? jonathan laurence : the foremost is integration into the educational system and the second , equally important perhaps , is political representation , for example through political parties . what role does religion play in the current discussion of integration ? clearly , it plays a very important one , since it is a very visible difference that marks migrants from a muslim-majority country as being somehow different or potentially more difficult to integrate , because islam can be seen as something that is incompatible with the german constitution or the german way of life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good german skills are essential for immigrant children , said laurence i think a very important change in this mentality has occurred with the current governing coalition and the initiatives of interior minister wolfgang schäuble , which are altogether welcome and - as he put it - it 's better late than never . although it 's been late in coming , the creation of a german-islam conference is perhaps the most concrete and tangible sign that , at last , the german government has taken the religious dimension seriously and begun to ensure equality for muslims in the same way that it does - admirably - for catholics , protestants and jews , among others . why do so many germans associate muslims with islamic fundamentalists ? islamic fundamentalism is one of the challenges of our era .
understandably , many societies which have a large muslim minority become uneasy and ask themselves how their muslim fellow citizens feel about the terrorist acts being committed in their name .
that 's a reasonable question to ask and waiting for an answer before jumping to conclusions should be part of the process . the way you get at that answer is by talking to your fellow citizens of muslim background and getting to know them and how they feel about religious and political issues , about the socio-economic challenges they face and the integration of these populations into society . i think you 'll often find that you 're pleasantly surprised , in that the largest federations of prayer spaces and the most important religious leaders will be among the first to denounce the misuse of religion for violent or political ends . what steps should the german government take in order to facilitate the integration process ? we have a number of recommendations that encourage the german government to carry forward with the excellent initiatives it has begun , notably the integration summit last july and the german-islam conference last september .
these are important forums whose existence should be celebrated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims should join political parties , said laurence now we have to get down to the harder question of what exactly is discussed in these forums , who participates , and to what end .
we 're not convinced that the question of values and the role of women in society , for example , are appropriate themes for what should be a relatively technical discussion of state-islam relations . another very important recommendation , which is more directed to the governments of the länder -lrb- states -rrb- , is to figure out a way to fund early linguistic training for four and five year olds among the migration population . these children are entering the school system with linguistic deficiencies and , therefore , have a serious handicap in terms of going on to the right schools , or at least those schools which are more likely to lead to a university diploma , which of course is the determining factor in success on the job market . what can the muslim side do to improve the integration process ? bildunterschrift : the islam conference was a welcome step in the right direction the muslim side is as varied as the german side .
that said , there are some important organizations which can play a key role in the integration process , not only on the religious side of the equation , but also on the political one . muslims should join germany 's political parties and become actively involved in asserting their rights and duties as citizens .
those who are not yet citizens should consider the possibility of naturalization .
living in a host society involves taking an active role in it . we also recommend that religious organizations assume their fully german character and focus on their main task , which is to facilitate the integration of turkish-origin migrants of all ideologies , sects and economic backgrounds . angela lieber interviewed jonathan laurence -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic group urges german hostages ' release in iraq an islamic group in germany called for the immediate release of two german citizens abducted in iraq , in an interview published on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2007 governing coalition partners slam us missile shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians fear a new arms race if the us plans go ahead over the weekend , chancellor angela merkel 's left-of-center coalition partners sharply criticized us plans to put parts of its missile shield in europe .
they said the project could spark a new arms race . politicians from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , merkel 's coalition partners , told german media over the weekend that us plans for a missile shield partly based in europe could bring back the bad old days of the cold war and its escalating arms race . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , an spd member , issued a thinly-veiled warning for washington in the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung not to try to split europe into " old " and " new " with its plans .
the terminology brought back memories of the tensions unleashed by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld when he used those very terms in describing european support for the war in iraq . spd chairman kurt beck turned up the volume further when he urged the bloc to unite against a project russia sees as an encroachment on its former sphere of influence and an attempt to shift the post-cold war balance of power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck just says no " we do n't need new missiles in europe , " beck told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
it was another echo , this time of the heated debate in germany during the late 1970s over the deployment of us pershing medium-range nuclear missiles in europe . under the current plan , the united states wants to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland by 2011 or 2012 .
it says the system is designed to counter threats from states like iran and north korea . " the spd does not want a new arms race between the usa and russia on european soil .
europe must speak with one voice on this , " beck said . their criticism of the us plan comes a day before steinmeier is due to travel to washington for talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice on issues including the middle east peace process and iran 's nuclear program . mounting concerns the hard talk also comes amid mounting unease in party ranks with germany 's military commitments abroad , notably in afghanistan , where the decision to sent tornado reconnaissance jets to that country has met with strong resistance .
there is also concern with merkel 's push to align germany with washington on key foreign policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant general henry obering 's pr tour did n't convince some last week the top us missile defence official , lieutenant general henry obering , was in europe trying to ease concerns on the continent about the missile shield plan . merkel , who repaired transatlantic ties after her spd predecessor gerhard schröder clashed with washington over the iraq war , has said she wants a debate on the missile shield within the nato alliance but has stopped short of criticizing the united states outright . she has expressed concerns that the row could overshadow germany 's presidency of the european union , dividing the bloc and hurting her bid to revive the european constitution . merkel is also hoping for us support for her efforts to remove transatlantic trade barriers and forge a consensus on combating climate change within the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where germany is also president . merkel was forced into a coalition with the spd after a narrow election victory in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missile shield debate in germany german politicians are getting more and more worried over the united states ’ plans for a nuclear defence shield to be installed in poland and the czech republic and probably also in the caucasus region .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- us says missile shield protects eu , open to nato framework the top us missile defense official sought to ease european fears about a missile shield that washington plans to deploy in two eu nations .
he also said the us is open to making the shield available to nato .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- europe skeptical about us missile shield plans as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good .

but none of that was pre-ordained .
the milestones of the past 50 years tell a story of bitter national rivalries , personality clashes and tortured compromises which have threatened the project 's survival more than once and may do so again in the coming years .
churchill saw european unity as a means of breaking the cycle of conflict winston churchill , britain 's wartime leader , called postwar europe " a rubble heap , a charnel-house , a breeding-ground for pestilence and hate " .
the challenges for europe included the retreat from colonial empires and the imminent security threat posed by the soviet union 's domination of eastern europe .
but a different concern motivated the architects of the european integration project - fear of an over-mighty germany .
the story began as a search for an over-arching political framework to tie west germany 's destiny to that of its western neighbours and make another war impossible .
first fiasco the first attempt ended in fiasco .
in 1952 six nations signed an ambitious treaty to set up a european defence community as a rival to the us-led nato alliance .
but the french parliament rejected the plan , judging that it would be too weak to allow france to keep the upper hand over a revived west germany .
de gaulle triggered the " empty chair " crisis economic integration proved more fruitful .
the european coal and steel community had shown the way by pooling national sovereignty in key industries .
the treaty of rome built on that to unite france and west germany , together with the four other founder members , in a european economic community .
but the fledgling eec soon faced another life-threatening crisis .
in 1965 , an imperious french president , charles de gaulle , threatened to wreck the eec unless the others acknowledged france 's special role in taking the community 's big decisions , especially over the common agricultural policy 's system of lavish subsidies , of which the lion 's share went to french farmers .
the result was the " empty chair crisis " , a french boycott of eec meetings which forced the rest to agree that each country would keep the power to veto common decisions to protect its vital national interests .
thus france firmly staked its claim to ownership of the european project .
and charles de gaulle acknowledged his motives in vetoing the uk 's attempts to join the eec until 1973 .
britain , he feared , would be a " trojan horse " for american influence .
two speeds that mistrust pointed to what was to come - a titanic , ongoing struggle among european states between a french-inspired euro-centric , dirigiste vision of the community 's purpose and a looser , free-market and atlanticist vision championed by britain .
yes and no : mitterrand the motor , and thatcher the reluctant european with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the end of the cold war the political battle for europe was joined again with renewed fervour .
european leaders ruled that german re-unification must be accompanied by a new effort to unify europe politically .
two formidable figures , chancellor helmut kohl of germany and president francois mitterrand of france , forged a uniquely close alliance and claimed a special role as the joint " engines " of european integration .
they made history by paving the way for the euro currency and the maastricht treaty which was to establish a european " union " .
but to latecomers such as britain and denmark it was all very hard to swallow .
a breaking-point seemed close when in 1990 britain 's prime minister margaret thatcher stridently rejected the prospect of more powers being signed over to european institutions , saying : " no.no.no. "
that immediate crisis passed when mrs thatcher was ousted from power at home .
but the underlying tensions remained .
the idea of a " two-speed " europe took root .
some nations embraced more common policies , such as the currency union , while others stood aside .
end of a dream and the eu faced another catch 22 : the " widening " of the union through enlargement clashed with its long-standing commitment to " deepening " .
so by the year 2000 , as the eu prepared to mark its triumph in bringing poland and other ex-communist states into the european family , europe was in other ways already coming apart .
treaty of rome signed 25 march 1957 at the palazzo dei conservatori , rome original name : treaty establishing the european economic community key objectives : a common market and customs union ; ever closer union among the peoples of europe ; pooling of resources to strengthen peace signatories : belgium , france , west germany , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands came into force on 1 january 1958 timeline of the eu in 2003 , the iraq war again exposed an old fault-line between atlanticists and the franco-german camp , this time allied with russia too .
so the 2005 crisis over the draft european constitution brought together an explosive mixture of disputes and resentments , over the eu 's power structures , its foreign policy orientation and social policies , in one moment of decision .
not surprisingly , something snapped - the patience of french and dutch voters , who said no .
the prime minister of luxembourg , jean-claude juncker , lamented that the people of europe had stopped believing in the " european dream " .
yet the eu goes on into its second half-century .
the pioneers of the european project talked much about the finalite politique - the political destination .
they were wise enough , though , not to define it .
because obviously , nobody knows .

but none of that was pre-ordained .
the milestones of the past 50 years tell a story of bitter national rivalries , personality clashes and tortured compromises which have threatened the project 's survival more than once and may do so again in the coming years .
churchill saw european unity as a means of breaking the cycle of conflict winston churchill , britain 's wartime leader , called postwar europe " a rubble heap , a charnel-house , a breeding-ground for pestilence and hate " .
the challenges for europe included the retreat from colonial empires and the imminent security threat posed by the soviet union 's domination of eastern europe .
but a different concern motivated the architects of the european integration project - fear of an over-mighty germany .
the story began as a search for an over-arching political framework to tie west germany 's destiny to that of its western neighbours and make another war impossible .
first fiasco the first attempt ended in fiasco .
in 1952 six nations signed an ambitious treaty to set up a european defence community as a rival to the us-led nato alliance .
but the french parliament rejected the plan , judging that it would be too weak to allow france to keep the upper hand over a revived west germany .
de gaulle triggered the " empty chair " crisis economic integration proved more fruitful .
the european coal and steel community had shown the way by pooling national sovereignty in key industries .
the treaty of rome built on that to unite france and west germany , together with the four other founder members , in a european economic community .
but the fledgling eec soon faced another life-threatening crisis .
in 1965 , an imperious french president , charles de gaulle , threatened to wreck the eec unless the others acknowledged france 's special role in taking the community 's big decisions , especially over the common agricultural policy 's system of lavish subsidies , of which the lion 's share went to french farmers .
the result was the " empty chair crisis " , a french boycott of eec meetings which forced the rest to agree that each country would keep the power to veto common decisions to protect its vital national interests .
thus france firmly staked its claim to ownership of the european project .

but none of that was pre-ordained .
the milestones of the past 50 years tell a story of bitter national rivalries , personality clashes and tortured compromises which have threatened the project 's survival more than once and may do so again in the coming years .
winston churchill , britain 's wartime leader , called postwar europe " a rubble heap , a charnel-house , a breeding-ground for pestilence and hate " .
the challenges for europe included the retreat from colonial empires and the imminent security threat posed by the soviet union 's domination of eastern europe .
but a different concern motivated the architects of the european integration project - fear of an over-mighty germany .
the story began as a search for an over-arching political framework to tie west germany 's destiny to that of its western neighbours and make another war impossible .
first fiasco the first attempt ended in fiasco .
in 1952 six nations signed an ambitious treaty to set up a european defence community as a rival to the us-led nato alliance .
but the french parliament rejected the plan , judging that it would be too weak to allow france to keep the upper hand over a revived west germany .
economic integration proved more fruitful .
the european coal and steel community had shown the way by pooling national sovereignty in key industries .
the treaty of rome built on that to unite france and west germany , together with the four other founder members , in a european economic community .
but the fledgling eec soon faced another life-threatening crisis .
in 1965 , an imperious french president , charles de gaulle , threatened to wreck the eec unless the others acknowledged france 's special role in taking the community 's big decisions , especially over the common agricultural policy 's system of lavish subsidies , of which the lion 's share went to french farmers .
the result was the " empty chair crisis " , a french boycott of eec meetings which forced the rest to agree that each country would keep the power to veto common decisions to protect its vital national interests .
thus france firmly staked its claim to ownership of the european project .
and charles de gaulle acknowledged his motives in vetoing the uk 's attempts to join the eec until 1973 .
britain , he feared , would be a " trojan horse " for american influence .
two speeds that mistrust pointed to what was to come - a titanic , ongoing struggle among european states between a french-inspired euro-centric , dirigiste vision of the community 's purpose and a looser , free-market and atlanticist vision championed by britain .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the end of the cold war the political battle for europe was joined again with renewed fervour .
european leaders ruled that german re-unification must be accompanied by a new effort to unify europe politically .
two formidable figures , chancellor helmut kohl of germany and president francois mitterrand of france , forged a uniquely close alliance and claimed a special role as the joint " engines " of european integration .
they made history by paving the way for the euro currency and the maastricht treaty which was to establish a european " union " .
but to latecomers such as britain and denmark it was all very hard to swallow .
a breaking-point seemed close when in 1990 britain 's prime minister margaret thatcher stridently rejected the prospect of more powers being signed over to european institutions , saying : " no.no.no. "
that immediate crisis passed when mrs thatcher was ousted from power at home .
but the underlying tensions remained .
the idea of a " two-speed " europe took root .
some nations embraced more common policies , such as the currency union , while others stood aside .
end of a dream and the eu faced another catch 22 : the " widening " of the union through enlargement clashed with its long-standing commitment to " deepening " .
so by the year 2000 , as the eu prepared to mark its triumph in bringing poland and other ex-communist states into the european family , europe was in other ways already coming apart .
treaty of rome signed 25 march 1957 at the palazzo dei conservatori , rome original name : treaty establishing the european economic community key objectives : a common market and customs union ; ever closer union among the peoples of europe ; pooling of resources to strengthen peace signatories : belgium , france , west germany , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands came into force on 1 january 1958 timeline of the eu in 2003 , the iraq war again exposed an old fault-line between atlanticists and the franco-german camp , this time allied with russia too .
so the 2005 crisis over the draft european constitution brought together an explosive mixture of disputes and resentments , over the eu 's power structures , its foreign policy orientation and social policies , in one moment of decision .
not surprisingly , something snapped - the patience of french and dutch voters , who said no .
the prime minister of luxembourg , jean-claude juncker , lamented that the people of europe had stopped believing in the " european dream " .
yet the eu goes on into its second half-century .
the pioneers of the european project talked much about the finalite politique - the political destination .
they were wise enough , though , not to define it .
because obviously , nobody knows .

they are among the thousands of women brought into the uk to be sex slaves , usually with no idea of their fate .
the trade was one of the findings of a bbc news website investigation into slavery in 21st century england .
as the uk marks 200 years since the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , slavery goes on in another form .
the slave trade , outlawed by legislation introduced in march 1807 , saw people from africa transported en masse to the americas with the involvement of people from the uk and other european countries .
women rescued modern day victims of slavery are often young women from eastern europe , thinking they are coming to england to work as cleaners or au pairs , only to be forced into prostitution . "
i was kept locked in the house for two weeks - he raped and slapped me every day " a sex slave victim 's story the home office estimated in 2003 that 4,000 women were trafficked into the uk for sexual exploitation .
it is thought the figure may have grown since .
police forces from cornwall to northumbria have found themselves having to rescue women and prosecute the traffickers who brought them to england to work as sex slaves .
and as well as foreign citizens coming to the uk , charity workers in manchester told the bbc they believed british women working in massage parlours had been sold abroad , because they owed the owners money .
child protection organisations and human rights groups also believe there are thousands of child sex slaves in the uk .
the uk human trafficking centre was opened last year to co-ordinate the law-enforcement approach to the problem .
a spokesman told the bbc women were sometimes sold off in auctions in airport coffee shops and restaurants as they arrived in the country .
and he said there were also many cases of english women , from backgrounds of poverty , being sold from town to town to work as prostitutes .
but it is now believed that as many as 85 % of women working in brothels in the uk have come from overseas - in the mid-1990s , an estimated 85 % were uk citizens .
operation pentameter , a home office initiative aimed at rescuing sex workers held against their will carried out between january and july 2006 , saw 84 trafficked women rescued , including 12 aged 14 to 17 .
some 230 arrests were made and more than £ 250,000 in cash was seized - but officers were only able to visit about 10 % of the estimated number of sex establishments in the country .
' horrific brutality ' the poppy project , a london-based scheme which provides accommodation and support for the women , has had 581 victims referred to it since its launch in 2003 .
its own research in 2004 found evidence of " off street " prostitution in every one of london 's 33 boroughs , again with the overwhelming majority of workers in brothels , saunas and massage parlours being non-british nationals .
the helen bamber foundation , set up to help victims of torture and other human rights violations , said women being forced into sex slavery in england were experiencing " horrific brutality " , with physical violence and the psychological trauma of being forced into sex . "
the man who owned me beat me and then sold me on - i was too much trouble " jiera , 19-year-old lithuanian trafficking victim many women rescued from the sex trade have said they were sold , or strongly encouraged into heading for the uk , by boyfriends or family members .
many think they are coming to work in jobs such as cleaning or ice cream selling .
jiera , a 19-year-old from lithuania who was helped by the poppy project , thought she was coming to london on holiday with friends , only to find they were people traffickers who sold her into prostitution .
she said : " when i was with clients i tried to pretend i was doing something else , but i could n't .
it made me so angry that i was often violent towards the clients .
' devastating effect ' " the man who owned me beat me and then sold me on .
i was too much trouble .
" even if my friends do n't judge me for what happened , they will always know what i did .
they will never forget , and neither can i. "
many police forces - and not only in major metropolitan areas - have set up specific teams to deal with the problem .
sussex police appointed a detective to lead investigations into sexual exploitation in november .
they said they had responded to information concerning potentially exploited women working in brothels in the county almost every week since .
the government prioritised human trafficking during the uk 's presidency of the eu in 2005 .
in the next few weeks it is to lay out a strategy to counter the problem .
a home office spokesman said : " human trafficking is a particularly horrible crime , based on deceit , exploitation and very often brutality .
" it is a crime that has a devastating effect on the lives of individuals , and contributes to the overall harm caused to the country by organised crime .
" it is important for all countries , including the uk , to do whatever is necessary to develop effective enforcement , prevention and victim support systems , both internationally and domestically . "

the trade was one of the findings of a bbc news website investigation into slavery in 21st century england .
as the uk marks 200 years since the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , slavery goes on in another form .
the slave trade , outlawed by legislation introduced in march 1807 , saw people from africa transported en masse to the americas with the involvement of people from the uk and other european countries .

a spokesman told the bbc women were sometimes sold off in auctions in airport coffee shops and restaurants as they arrived in the country .
and he said there were also many cases of english women , from backgrounds of poverty , being sold from town to town to work as prostitutes .
but it is now believed that as many as 85 % of women working in brothels in the uk have come from overseas - in the mid-1990s , an estimated 85 % were uk citizens .
operation pentameter , a home office initiative aimed at rescuing sex workers held against their will carried out between january and july 2006 , saw 84 trafficked women rescued , including 12 aged 14 to 17 .

police investigating human trafficking and slavery across the uk have to admit they still do not know the full extent of the problem .
in 2000 the government set up reflex , a taskforce aimed at co-ordinating the law enforcement response to people trafficking - funded by the home office at £ 20m a year .
last year , reflex funded operation pentameter , a home office initiative aimed at rescuing sex workers held against their will .
' trapped and kidnapped ' the operation saw 84 trafficked women or girls rescued between january and july 2006 , despite the fact police involved in it were only able to visit about 10 % of the estimated total of sex establishments in the country .
as the operation came to a close , it was announced that the uk 's first specialist centre to co-ordinate the police approach to combating people trafficking was to be set up .
the united kingdom human trafficking centre -lrb- ukhtc -rrb- opened in yorkshire in the autumn of 2006 based in a secret location in sheffield .
it combines research and intelligence teams and builds on the results of operation pentameter and the work done by police forces before and since .
the people are severely traumatised and have to live with this for the rest of their lives ukhtc spokesman people-trafficking centre opens a spokesman for the centre said : " operation pentameter was n't the start , it was a concerted national campaign trying to get to grips with the extent of the problem , and we are doing ongoing work all the time .
" we know we 've got a problem and we are trying to investigate it better .
" it 's not a problem that 's unique to the urban areas , it takes place in the suburbs and the countryside as well - wherever you 've got a demand for sexual services .
" you 've also got labour exploitation , people working in things like fish processing , some of whom have been trafficked , and people working as servants who have been exploited .
" it is n't just about illegal immigrants .
we 've got a lot of people who are eu citizens but are exploited by criminal gangs who have trapped them or kidnapped them .
the centre was opened in the autumn of 2006 " we also have internal human trafficking within the uk , people who are perhaps less well educated and come from a background of poverty who can be moved from town to town and exploited . "
the team working at the centre consider raising the public 's awareness of the issues of people trafficking , sex slavery and exploitation as a key part of their role .
they hope that by making people see the effects of the trade , they might prompt a change in opinion that sparks a fall in demand for prostitution .
the spokesman said : " anything we can do to raise awareness of these issues is important .
' not acceptable ' " i would hope people would be worried at the extent of the problem and would be very much against it .
" rather like william wilberforce who got a group of people together to act against slavery , it 's a case of creating an environment where it 's not acceptable .
" like the climate that 's changing around mobile phones and driving or cigarette smoking , the shift in public opinion takes time .
wherever you are and wherever you are going , you might have a trafficking victim in your midst ukhtc spokesman " it 's creating an environment where people think ' hang on , i ca n't do that because it impacts on individuals ' .
" the people are severely traumatised and have to live with this for the rest of their lives . "
he said the officers dealt with a girl from lithuania who was brought to england thinking she was going to be selling ice cream in the summer .
" but she was sold in a coffee shop at gatwick airport and went on to be repeatedly raped , abused and beaten and used as a prostitute - and this was a 15-year-old girl , " he said .
" we are investigating cases like this on a regular basis and it 's good that we have got very robust laws - in the case of the lithuanian girl two men got sentences of 21 years and 15 years , and others were arrested and jailed in lithuania .
' concerned or distressed ' " we will chase after these people , not only nationally but internationally .
" it poses problems when it 's an international crime and brings challenges which are n't straightforward but we are getting used to it . "
he said raising awareness of the devastating impacts of the trade could lead not only to a reduction in demand , but also improve the chances of people trafficking being stopped before it happens .
" any form of transport you are on , there may be a trafficking victim with you .
" wherever you are and wherever you are going , you might have a trafficking victim in your midst .
" she may look a little concerned or distressed or they may not even know until they are sold that they are being trafficked , but if people start to recognise the signs , they may think to tell someone in authority . "

police investigating human trafficking and slavery across the uk have to admit they still do not know the full extent of the problem .
in 2000 the government set up reflex , a taskforce aimed at co-ordinating the law enforcement response to people trafficking - funded by the home office at £ 20m a year .
last year , reflex funded operation pentameter , a home office initiative aimed at rescuing sex workers held against their will .
' trapped and kidnapped ' the operation saw 84 trafficked women or girls rescued between january and july 2006 , despite the fact police involved in it were only able to visit about 10 % of the estimated total of sex establishments in the country .
as the operation came to a close , it was announced that the uk 's first specialist centre to co-ordinate the police approach to combating people trafficking was to be set up .
the united kingdom human trafficking centre -lrb- ukhtc -rrb- opened in yorkshire in the autumn of 2006 based in a secret location in sheffield .
it combines research and intelligence teams and builds on the results of operation pentameter and the work done by police forces before and since .
the people are severely traumatised and have to live with this for the rest of their lives ukhtc spokesman people-trafficking centre opens a spokesman for the centre said : " operation pentameter was n't the start , it was a concerted national campaign trying to get to grips with the extent of the problem , and we are doing ongoing work all the time .
" we know we 've got a problem and we are trying to investigate it better .
" it 's not a problem that 's unique to the urban areas , it takes place in the suburbs and the countryside as well - wherever you 've got a demand for sexual services .
" you 've also got labour exploitation , people working in things like fish processing , some of whom have been trafficked , and people working as servants who have been exploited .
" it is n't just about illegal immigrants .
we 've got a lot of people who are eu citizens but are exploited by criminal gangs who have trapped them or kidnapped them .
the centre was opened in the autumn of 2006 " we also have internal human trafficking within the uk , people who are perhaps less well educated and come from a background of poverty who can be moved from town to town and exploited . "
the team working at the centre consider raising the public 's awareness of the issues of people trafficking , sex slavery and exploitation as a key part of their role .
they hope that by making people see the effects of the trade , they might prompt a change in opinion that sparks a fall in demand for prostitution .
the spokesman said : " anything we can do to raise awareness of these issues is important .
' not acceptable ' " i would hope people would be worried at the extent of the problem and would be very much against it .
" rather like william wilberforce who got a group of people together to act against slavery , it 's a case of creating an environment where it 's not acceptable .

police investigating human trafficking and slavery across the uk have to admit they still do not know the full extent of the problem .
in 2000 the government set up reflex , a taskforce aimed at co-ordinating the law enforcement response to people trafficking - funded by the home office at £ 20m a year .
last year , reflex funded operation pentameter , a home office initiative aimed at rescuing sex workers held against their will .
' trapped and kidnapped ' the operation saw 84 trafficked women or girls rescued between january and july 2006 , despite the fact police involved in it were only able to visit about 10 % of the estimated total of sex establishments in the country .
as the operation came to a close , it was announced that the uk 's first specialist centre to co-ordinate the police approach to combating people trafficking was to be set up .
the united kingdom human trafficking centre -lrb- ukhtc -rrb- opened in yorkshire in the autumn of 2006 based in a secret location in sheffield .
it combines research and intelligence teams and builds on the results of operation pentameter and the work done by police forces before and since .
the people are severely traumatised and have to live with this for the rest of their lives ukhtc spokesman people-trafficking centre opens a spokesman for the centre said : " operation pentameter was n't the start , it was a concerted national campaign trying to get to grips with the extent of the problem , and we are doing ongoing work all the time .
" we know we 've got a problem and we are trying to investigate it better .
" it 's not a problem that 's unique to the urban areas , it takes place in the suburbs and the countryside as well - wherever you 've got a demand for sexual services .
" you 've also got labour exploitation , people working in things like fish processing , some of whom have been trafficked , and people working as servants who have been exploited .
" it is n't just about illegal immigrants .
we 've got a lot of people who are eu citizens but are exploited by criminal gangs who have trapped them or kidnapped them .
the centre was opened in the autumn of 2006 " we also have internal human trafficking within the uk , people who are perhaps less well educated and come from a background of poverty who can be moved from town to town and exploited . "
the team working at the centre consider raising the public 's awareness of the issues of people trafficking , sex slavery and exploitation as a key part of their role .
they hope that by making people see the effects of the trade , they might prompt a change in opinion that sparks a fall in demand for prostitution .
the spokesman said : " anything we can do to raise awareness of these issues is important .
' not acceptable ' " i would hope people would be worried at the extent of the problem and would be very much against it .
" rather like william wilberforce who got a group of people together to act against slavery , it 's a case of creating an environment where it 's not acceptable .
" like the climate that 's changing around mobile phones and driving or cigarette smoking , the shift in public opinion takes time .
wherever you are and wherever you are going , you might have a trafficking victim in your midst ukhtc spokesman " it 's creating an environment where people think ' hang on , i ca n't do that because it impacts on individuals ' .
" the people are severely traumatised and have to live with this for the rest of their lives . "
he said the officers dealt with a girl from lithuania who was brought to england thinking she was going to be selling ice cream in the summer .
" but she was sold in a coffee shop at gatwick airport and went on to be repeatedly raped , abused and beaten and used as a prostitute - and this was a 15-year-old girl , " he said .
" we are investigating cases like this on a regular basis and it 's good that we have got very robust laws - in the case of the lithuanian girl two men got sentences of 21 years and 15 years , and others were arrested and jailed in lithuania .
' concerned or distressed ' " we will chase after these people , not only nationally but internationally .
" it poses problems when it 's an international crime and brings challenges which are n't straightforward but we are getting used to it . "
he said raising awareness of the devastating impacts of the trade could lead not only to a reduction in demand , but also improve the chances of people trafficking being stopped before it happens .
" any form of transport you are on , there may be a trafficking victim with you .
" wherever you are and wherever you are going , you might have a trafficking victim in your midst .
" she may look a little concerned or distressed or they may not even know until they are sold that they are being trafficked , but if people start to recognise the signs , they may think to tell someone in authority . "

despite the gangmasters licensing authority -lrb- gla -rrb- , set up after 21 chinese cockle pickers died at morecambe bay in lancashire in 2005 , some gangmasters continue to make money from the misery of migrant workers , bbc news has found .
petr torak knows only too well the difficulties faced by migrants coming to a new country .
mr torak , who became a police community support officer with cambridgeshire police in december last year , came from the czech republic to the uk as a migrant worker in 1999 .
as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , mr toarak said that every day he comes across cases of the exploitation of migrant workers in the peterborough and wisbech areas .
' took passports away ' " the gangmasters from eastern europe go to the cities in the czech republic and get homeless people from the streets and offer them a roof over their heads and a decent job if they come to the uk , " he said .
" they take their passports away .
they work them six or seven days a week in the food processing industry .
they get a room in a house and there 's normally four to a room .
" they get a few cans of beans to eat and some cheap bread and are paid £ 5 a week .
of the £ 250 the gangmasters get per person , the most they spend on them is £ 50 .
" people are definitely scared of talking .
sometimes they just run away .
" if people say they want more money -lsb- from the gangmaster -rsb- they are kicked out of their accommodation .
" they are obligated to work .
this is slavery . "
oonagh tucker , who investigates cases for the citizens advice bureau -lrb- cab -rrb- in wisbech , cambridgeshire , said she has come across cases where gangmasters had threatened workers with violence if they did not continue to work for them .
" other workers have been told they have to pay them -lsb- the gangmasters -rsb- to leave their employment , " she said .
she said the behaviour of some gangmasters continued to intimidate workers even after they had registered with gla .
" it is registered slavery , " added mrs tucker .
linda hutchinson , bureau manager of the fenland cab in cambridgeshire , said many latvians and lithuanians were brought over to the east of england by gangmasters .
she said that while some gangmasters in the region treat workers well and responsibly , others " are just breaching all sorts of agreements and legislation .
they dismiss people without notice " .
she has concerns about the gla which she believed was " more concerned about getting them licensed than worrying about what they do once they are licensed " .
a cab report for the fenland area , which has been submitted to the east of england development agency -lrb- eeda -rrb- , says : " certain gangmasters receive several complaints each week , often where violence has been threatened against workers .
' violence threatened ' " some gangmasters insist on all employees renting accommodation through them , evicting them without notice if sick or pregnant . "
the report says violence is threatened if the workers resist or complain .
it says that while most gangmasters have registered with the gla , the unscrupulous gangsters " continue to breach license conditions and flout employment laws on a regular basis " .
" complaints against gangmasters are increasing , not decreasing as we hoped they would with licence enforcement . "
film producer jez lewis , who co-wrote the new nick broomfield film ghosts about the deaths at morecambe bay , said his research for the movie suggests unscrupulous gangmasters are still operating despite the gla .
" the problem with it is that it is pretty toothless , " said mr lewis , who lives near diss , which is on the norfolk / suffolk border .
pc ashley grant , minorities and ethnic liaison officer with norfolk police , said it was vital to " highlight the plight of people entering this country who are taken advantage of from unscrupulous companies " .
he has dealt with a whole host of cases where gangmasters have infringed employment regulations .
' exploited workers ' one example is a case of a group of migrant workers who travelled from poland after each paid a gangmaster £ 300 .
the treated received by the men and women , who worked in the food processing industry in south norfolk , included : having £ 10 deducted from the wages of all the employees after two other employees damaged some equipment having £ 20 deducted from their salary each week for transport to the place of work , even if they did not use it men and woman who did not know each other having to share the same bedroom accommodation .
klara skrivankova , a people trafficking researcher with anti-slavery international , said the gla was in its early days and she was waiting to see " action on enforcement " to stop unscrupulous gangmasters .
a spokesman for the gla said the organisation does have teeth with " severe " penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for unlicensed gangmasters .
he added : " the gla is about to pass its first three cases for prosecution to lawyers ... and last month it revoked 13 licenses . "
" the gla will only make a difference through effective enforcement - through cautions , arrests , revocations and loss or disruption of business . "
ghosts co-writer and producer jez lewis will be answering questions after the 2000 gmt screening of the film on 25 march at cinema city , norwich .

despite the gangmasters licensing authority -lrb- gla -rrb- , set up after 21 chinese cockle pickers died at morecambe bay in lancashire in 2005 , some gangmasters continue to make money from the misery of migrant workers , bbc news has found .
petr torak knows only too well the difficulties faced by migrants coming to a new country .
mr torak , who became a police community support officer with cambridgeshire police in december last year , came from the czech republic to the uk as a migrant worker in 1999 .
as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , mr toarak said that every day he comes across cases of the exploitation of migrant workers in the peterborough and wisbech areas .
' took passports away ' " the gangmasters from eastern europe go to the cities in the czech republic and get homeless people from the streets and offer them a roof over their heads and a decent job if they come to the uk , " he said .
" they take their passports away .
they work them six or seven days a week in the food processing industry .
they get a room in a house and there 's normally four to a room .
" they get a few cans of beans to eat and some cheap bread and are paid £ 5 a week .
of the £ 250 the gangmasters get per person , the most they spend on them is £ 50 .
" people are definitely scared of talking .
sometimes they just run away .
" if people say they want more money -lsb- from the gangmaster -rsb- they are kicked out of their accommodation .
" they are obligated to work .
this is slavery . "
migrant communities have grown up in parts of peterborough oonagh tucker , who investigates cases for the citizens advice bureau -lrb- cab -rrb- in wisbech , cambridgeshire , said she has come across cases where gangmasters had threatened workers with violence if they did not continue to work for them .
" other workers have been told they have to pay them -lsb- the gangmasters -rsb- to leave their employment , " she said .
she said the behaviour of some gangmasters continued to intimidate workers even after they had registered with gla .
" it is registered slavery , " added mrs tucker .
linda hutchinson , bureau manager of the fenland cab in cambridgeshire , said many latvians and lithuanians were brought over to the east of england by gangmasters .
she said that while some gangmasters in the region treat workers well and responsibly , others " are just breaching all sorts of agreements and legislation .
they dismiss people without notice " .
she has concerns about the gla which she believed was " more concerned about getting them licensed than worrying about what they do once they are licensed " .
a cab report for the fenland area , which has been submitted to the east of england development agency -lrb- eeda -rrb- , says : " certain gangmasters receive several complaints each week , often where violence has been threatened against workers .
' violence threatened ' " some gangmasters insist on all employees renting accommodation through them , evicting them without notice if sick or pregnant . "
the report says violence is threatened if the workers resist or complain .
it says that while most gangmasters have registered with the gla , the unscrupulous gangsters " continue to breach license conditions and flout employment laws on a regular basis " .
" complaints against gangmasters are increasing , not decreasing as we hoped they would with licence enforcement . "
film producer jez lewis , who co-wrote the new nick broomfield film ghosts about the deaths at morecambe bay , said his research for the movie suggests unscrupulous gangmasters are still operating despite the gla .
" the problem with it is that it is pretty toothless , " said mr lewis , who lives near diss , which is on the norfolk / suffolk border .
pc ashley grant , minorities and ethnic liaison officer with norfolk police , said it was vital to " highlight the plight of people entering this country who are taken advantage of from unscrupulous companies " .
he has dealt with a whole host of cases where gangmasters have infringed employment regulations .
' exploited workers ' one example is a case of a group of migrant workers who travelled from poland after each paid a gangmaster £ 300 .
the treated received by the men and women , who worked in the food processing industry in south norfolk , included : having £ 10 deducted from the wages of all the employees after two other employees damaged some equipment having £ 20 deducted from their salary each week for transport to the place of work , even if they did not use it men and woman who did not know each other having to share the same bedroom accommodation .
klara skrivankova , a people trafficking researcher with anti-slavery international , said the gla was in its early days and she was waiting to see " action on enforcement " to stop unscrupulous gangmasters .

despite the gangmasters licensing authority -lrb- gla -rrb- , set up after 21 chinese cockle pickers died at morecambe bay in lancashire in 2005 , some gangmasters continue to make money from the misery of migrant workers , bbc news has found .
petr torak knows only too well the difficulties faced by migrants coming to a new country .
mr torak , who became a police community support officer with cambridgeshire police in december last year , came from the czech republic to the uk as a migrant worker in 1999 .
as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , mr toarak said that every day he comes across cases of the exploitation of migrant workers in the peterborough and wisbech areas .
' took passports away ' " the gangmasters from eastern europe go to the cities in the czech republic and get homeless people from the streets and offer them a roof over their heads and a decent job if they come to the uk , " he said .
" they take their passports away .
they work them six or seven days a week in the food processing industry .
they get a room in a house and there 's normally four to a room .
" they get a few cans of beans to eat and some cheap bread and are paid £ 5 a week .
of the £ 250 the gangmasters get per person , the most they spend on them is £ 50 .
" people are definitely scared of talking .
sometimes they just run away .
" if people say they want more money -lsb- from the gangmaster -rsb- they are kicked out of their accommodation .
" they are obligated to work .
this is slavery . "
migrant communities have grown up in parts of peterborough oonagh tucker , who investigates cases for the citizens advice bureau -lrb- cab -rrb- in wisbech , cambridgeshire , said she has come across cases where gangmasters had threatened workers with violence if they did not continue to work for them .
" other workers have been told they have to pay them -lsb- the gangmasters -rsb- to leave their employment , " she said .
she said the behaviour of some gangmasters continued to intimidate workers even after they had registered with gla .
" it is registered slavery , " added mrs tucker .
linda hutchinson , bureau manager of the fenland cab in cambridgeshire , said many latvians and lithuanians were brought over to the east of england by gangmasters .
she said that while some gangmasters in the region treat workers well and responsibly , others " are just breaching all sorts of agreements and legislation .
they dismiss people without notice " .
she has concerns about the gla which she believed was " more concerned about getting them licensed than worrying about what they do once they are licensed " .
a cab report for the fenland area , which has been submitted to the east of england development agency -lrb- eeda -rrb- , says : " certain gangmasters receive several complaints each week , often where violence has been threatened against workers .
' violence threatened ' " some gangmasters insist on all employees renting accommodation through them , evicting them without notice if sick or pregnant . "
the report says violence is threatened if the workers resist or complain .
it says that while most gangmasters have registered with the gla , the unscrupulous gangsters " continue to breach license conditions and flout employment laws on a regular basis " .
" complaints against gangmasters are increasing , not decreasing as we hoped they would with licence enforcement . "
film producer jez lewis , who co-wrote the new nick broomfield film ghosts about the deaths at morecambe bay , said his research for the movie suggests unscrupulous gangmasters are still operating despite the gla .
" the problem with it is that it is pretty toothless , " said mr lewis , who lives near diss , which is on the norfolk / suffolk border .
pc ashley grant , minorities and ethnic liaison officer with norfolk police , said it was vital to " highlight the plight of people entering this country who are taken advantage of from unscrupulous companies " .
he has dealt with a whole host of cases where gangmasters have infringed employment regulations .
' exploited workers ' one example is a case of a group of migrant workers who travelled from poland after each paid a gangmaster £ 300 .
the treated received by the men and women , who worked in the food processing industry in south norfolk , included : having £ 10 deducted from the wages of all the employees after two other employees damaged some equipment having £ 20 deducted from their salary each week for transport to the place of work , even if they did not use it men and woman who did not know each other having to share the same bedroom accommodation .
klara skrivankova , a people trafficking researcher with anti-slavery international , said the gla was in its early days and she was waiting to see " action on enforcement " to stop unscrupulous gangmasters .
a spokesman for the gla said the organisation does have teeth with " severe " penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for unlicensed gangmasters .
he added : " the gla is about to pass its first three cases for prosecution to lawyers ... and last month it revoked 13 licenses . "
" the gla will only make a difference through effective enforcement - through cautions , arrests , revocations and loss or disruption of business . "

by sallie george bbc news the foundation said the women 's lives became ' devoid of meaning ' the fate of women who have been forced into a life of sex slavery in modern britain is often unknown .
the helen bamber foundation , set up to help victims of torture and other human rights violations , is counselling 35 women trafficked into the uk .
clinician lucy kralj said each woman had experienced " horrific brutality " .
but the home office often did not believe what had happened to them , and some victims escaped their captors only to be jailed , the foundation said .
' never free ' the government 's refusal to believe the women 's accounts was also reflected in the high refusal rate for asylum , it said .
life becomes devoid of any meaning and she can never be free of the horror through which she has lived lucy kralj , helen bamber foundation clinician lucy kralj said that though each woman 's experience was different , all - without exception - had been subjected to " horrific levels " of physical and sexual abuse .
she said the experience of living in captivity - sometimes for years - had a profound effect on the women she had seen .
" she is violated repeatedly , daily , accompanied by physical violence and verbal insults " , she said .
" she loses her sense of self , her identity .
life becomes devoid of any meaning and she can never be free of the horror through which she has lived .
" her sense of femininity has been annihilated .
she shuts her eyes and sees the horror .
she looks at her body and the scars and physical pain serve as a constant reminder .
" all men are potential rapists and any hope for the future of which she once dreamed has been robbed from her .
" she finds herself repulsive and she believes that her past is transparent to everyone . "
physical effects the women 's experiences come at a time the uk is marking the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which led to the abolition of the slave trade .
most of the women counselled by the foundation had been forced to " serve " upwards of 20 customers every day .
the foundation offers victims a place to regain a sense of control many had been beaten so badly they had sustained multiple head injuries , with several going on to develop epilepsy .
many had become pregnant after being raped .
pregnancies were frequently terminated by traffickers but five of the women had young babies conceived while working as prostitute .
the women lived in fear that following their own escape , their family would become targeted by traffickers , while others had been rejected by their families when they had learned of their fate as a prostitute .
ms kralj said the aim of the foundation 's work was to offer the women a place where they could begin to regain a sense of control .
never obliged to speak of their experiences , they were offered a range of therapeutic activities and helped to get access to mainstream medical services .
but the most difficult obstacle was getting permission to stay in the country .
asylum appeals more than half of the women being treated by the foundation were from albania , with others from russia , africa , china , vietnam , mongolia and india .
she wants people to be aware that women being used in this way are people and not animals , although this is how they are being treated lucy kralj , clinician the majority of the women had been brought to work in london , while some had been trafficked into birmingham and manchester .
most were refused asylum following interview by the home office , with only one granted discretionary leave to remain in the uk .
all the others had to go through an asylum protection appeal .
two were granted asylum , while another six were granted humanitarian protection for a limited period , generally of one year .
four were refused following appeal but all had been granted a reconsideration hearing .
the remaining 22 were awaiting an initial decision on their asylum application .
ms kralj said : " the women are frequently disbelieved by the home office ... this is experienced by women as further devastation and proof that in the eyes of all humans her life is worthless .
" we act as witnesses to the women who have been trafficked and we are always prepared to provide evidence on their behalf to the courts and home office decision makers . "
jailed after escape sandra , from sierra leone , came to the uk aged 11 after being befriended by a british man who told her he could help her find a school .
once in the uk , she was taken to a flat in london and not allowed out .
when she was 12 she was drugged and gang raped .
from that day on , she was forced to serve up to 10 men every day .
when she attempted suicide aged 15 , sandra was moved to a separate location and locked in solitary confinement .
ms kralj said : " this isolation and terror endured for a further five years with increased levels of physical violence at the hands of her pimp . "
one morning , her captor forgot to lock her bedroom door before leaving the house and sandra grabbed her chance and ran .
she was later picked up by the police , who asked her for identification .
when she was unable to produce any , she was arrested and later jailed for immigration offences .
ms kralj said : " she is now released , her jail term over and she has been granted leave to remain in the uk for one year .

she shuts her eyes and sees the horror .
she looks at her body and the scars and physical pain serve as a constant reminder .
" all men are potential rapists and any hope for the future of which she once dreamed has been robbed from her .

by sallie george bbc news the foundation said the women 's lives became ' devoid of meaning ' the fate of women who have been forced into a life of sex slavery in modern britain is often unknown .
the helen bamber foundation , set up to help victims of torture and other human rights violations , is counselling 35 women trafficked into the uk .
clinician lucy kralj said each woman had experienced " horrific brutality " .
but the home office often did not believe what had happened to them , and some victims escaped their captors only to be jailed , the foundation said .
' never free ' the government 's refusal to believe the women 's accounts was also reflected in the high refusal rate for asylum , it said .
life becomes devoid of any meaning and she can never be free of the horror through which she has lived lucy kralj , helen bamber foundation clinician lucy kralj said that though each woman 's experience was different , all - without exception - had been subjected to " horrific levels " of physical and sexual abuse .
she said the experience of living in captivity - sometimes for years - had a profound effect on the women she had seen .
" she is violated repeatedly , daily , accompanied by physical violence and verbal insults " , she said .
" she loses her sense of self , her identity .
life becomes devoid of any meaning and she can never be free of the horror through which she has lived .
" her sense of femininity has been annihilated .
she shuts her eyes and sees the horror .
she looks at her body and the scars and physical pain serve as a constant reminder .
" all men are potential rapists and any hope for the future of which she once dreamed has been robbed from her .
" she finds herself repulsive and she believes that her past is transparent to everyone . "
physical effects the women 's experiences come at a time the uk is marking the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which led to the abolition of the slave trade .
most of the women counselled by the foundation had been forced to " serve " upwards of 20 customers every day .
the foundation offers victims a place to regain a sense of control many had been beaten so badly they had sustained multiple head injuries , with several going on to develop epilepsy .
many had become pregnant after being raped .
pregnancies were frequently terminated by traffickers but five of the women had young babies conceived while working as prostitute .
the women lived in fear that following their own escape , their family would become targeted by traffickers , while others had been rejected by their families when they had learned of their fate as a prostitute .
ms kralj said the aim of the foundation 's work was to offer the women a place where they could begin to regain a sense of control .
never obliged to speak of their experiences , they were offered a range of therapeutic activities and helped to get access to mainstream medical services .
but the most difficult obstacle was getting permission to stay in the country .
asylum appeals more than half of the women being treated by the foundation were from albania , with others from russia , africa , china , vietnam , mongolia and india .
she wants people to be aware that women being used in this way are people and not animals , although this is how they are being treated lucy kralj , clinician the majority of the women had been brought to work in london , while some had been trafficked into birmingham and manchester .
most were refused asylum following interview by the home office , with only one granted discretionary leave to remain in the uk .
all the others had to go through an asylum protection appeal .
two were granted asylum , while another six were granted humanitarian protection for a limited period , generally of one year .
four were refused following appeal but all had been granted a reconsideration hearing .
the remaining 22 were awaiting an initial decision on their asylum application .
ms kralj said : " the women are frequently disbelieved by the home office ... this is experienced by women as further devastation and proof that in the eyes of all humans her life is worthless .
" we act as witnesses to the women who have been trafficked and we are always prepared to provide evidence on their behalf to the courts and home office decision makers . "
jailed after escape sandra , from sierra leone , came to the uk aged 11 after being befriended by a british man who told her he could help her find a school .
once in the uk , she was taken to a flat in london and not allowed out .
when she was 12 she was drugged and gang raped .
from that day on , she was forced to serve up to 10 men every day .
when she attempted suicide aged 15 , sandra was moved to a separate location and locked in solitary confinement .
ms kralj said : " this isolation and terror endured for a further five years with increased levels of physical violence at the hands of her pimp . "
one morning , her captor forgot to lock her bedroom door before leaving the house and sandra grabbed her chance and ran .
she was later picked up by the police , who asked her for identification .
when she was unable to produce any , she was arrested and later jailed for immigration offences .
ms kralj said : " she is now released , her jail term over and she has been granted leave to remain in the uk for one year .
" she agreed for her story to be shared because she wants people to be aware that women being used in this way are people and not animals , although this is how they are being treated . "

the gmb and unison claim women working for councils have been under-paid compared to men in equivalent jobs .
in 1997 , councils agreed to review wages and implement new pay structures , with the deadline falling at the end of this month .
the welsh local government association said councils were committed to equal pay but warned it would cost £ 300m .
the unions have warned that many councils in wales could face legal action if they fail to introduce equal pay for women and men and have said they will encourage their members to begin legal action in areas where unequal pay persists .
john phillips , of the gmb union , said that " progress has been appallingly slow in some areas " and said some authorities had shown a " lack of will " to implement the agreement reached a decade ago .
the welsh assembly government has made extra money available for equal pay for the future , but has said councils need to foot the bill for back pay .
steve thomas , chief executive of the wlga warned the eventual bill could have an impact on council projects .
he said : " big capital programmes such as the building of schools or bridge repairs or road repairs that might have to go on the back burner for a while in order for us to meet the cost the liabilities involved . "

researchers from hull 's wilberforce institute say thousands of migrant workers in the uk are being severely exploited by unscrupulous employers .
many of them work under such a level of exploitation it meets the international definition of " forced labour " .
" we are all compromised by slavery " , professor gary craig said .
in every city and every rural area of this region there are people working in slavery conditions professor gary craig , wise the associate director of the wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation -lrb- wise -rrb- said in the yorkshire and humber region alone , there were hundreds if not thousands of people living and working in slavery conditions .
sex slavery of women and children , as well as forced labour and debt bondage were all present in the region and across the uk , he said .
prof craig said : " slavery is very much alive and well in yorkshire today .
" in every city and every rural area of this region there are people who are working in slavery conditions . "
hot-bedding wise says there are thousands of modern slaves in the uk studies have put the net benefit to the uk economy of migrant workers at between £ 2bn and £ 3bn per year .
but prof craig said research showed these workers often worked for less pay , longer basic hours , with no sick pay , paid holiday , or written contract covering hours , conditions , pay and dismissal procedures .
most were unaware of their rights and lived in " poor to appalling " accommodation , often six or more mixed-sex to a room , sometimes operating a " hot-bed " system , with workers sharing beds according to shift patterns .
in many cases , workers were forced deeply into debt by their employers and this , coupled with threats of violence , kept them working in " absolutely appalling " , slave-like conditions .
there are up to 90,000 migrant workers in the yorkshire and humber region alone .
' barely credible ' it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in prof gary craig , wise prof craig said : " all of us need to ask awkward questions .
" are the newly-arrived migrants - serving us , supporting our job , working alongside us , living down the street - getting access to appropriate housing and employment conditions ?
" if not , we should protest , complain , report .
" many of us are too happy to enjoy the fruits of their labour but not pay an appropriate price for it . "
areas where exploitation occured ranged from agricultural work to food processing and packing , the catering and restaurant trade to nursing and domestic work .
prof craig said many large british companies relied on people working in slavery conditions to produce the goods they sold .
he said the complex nature of supply chains made it feasible for the company at the top of the chain to deny any knowledge of working conditions at the bottom .
prof craig said everyone needed to ask ' awkward questions ' but , he said : " it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in . "
the university of hull 's wise researchers documented cases of exploitation for an extensive study into modern slavery in the uk , co-written by anti-slavery international and commissioned by the york-based joseph rowntree foundation .
dr mick wilkinson said he met a latvian woman who had been charged £ 100 to sign up to an employment agency .
he said : " she was transported from hull to barnsley in a vehicle , she was then working eight-hour night shifts , she was sleeping two hours in the car and being woken up to work an eight-hour morning shift , and then transported back to hull . "
deductions for administration and transport were made from her wages and any complaints were met with threats of being sacked and losing her accommodation .
" we are talking about people in these conditions who are regularly working 70 hours a week and are pocketing £ 50 , " dr wilkinson said .

researchers from hull 's wilberforce institute say thousands of migrant workers in the uk are being severely exploited by unscrupulous employers .
many of them work under such a level of exploitation it meets the international definition of " forced labour " .
" we are all compromised by slavery " , professor gary craig said .
in every city and every rural area of this region there are people working in slavery conditions professor gary craig , wise the associate director of the wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation -lrb- wise -rrb- said in the yorkshire and humber region alone , there were hundreds if not thousands of people living and working in slavery conditions .
sex slavery of women and children , as well as forced labour and debt bondage were all present in the region and across the uk , he said .
prof craig said : " slavery is very much alive and well in yorkshire today .
" in every city and every rural area of this region there are people who are working in slavery conditions . "
hot-bedding wise says there are thousands of modern slaves in the uk studies have put the net benefit to the uk economy of migrant workers at between £ 2bn and £ 3bn per year .
but prof craig said research showed these workers often worked for less pay , longer basic hours , with no sick pay , paid holiday , or written contract covering hours , conditions , pay and dismissal procedures .
most were unaware of their rights and lived in " poor to appalling " accommodation , often six or more mixed-sex to a room , sometimes operating a " hot-bed " system , with workers sharing beds according to shift patterns .
in many cases , workers were forced deeply into debt by their employers and this , coupled with threats of violence , kept them working in " absolutely appalling " , slave-like conditions .
there are up to 90,000 migrant workers in the yorkshire and humber region alone .
' barely credible ' it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in prof gary craig , wise prof craig said : " all of us need to ask awkward questions .
" are the newly-arrived migrants - serving us , supporting our job , working alongside us , living down the street - getting access to appropriate housing and employment conditions ?
" if not , we should protest , complain , report .
" many of us are too happy to enjoy the fruits of their labour but not pay an appropriate price for it . "
areas where exploitation occured ranged from agricultural work to food processing and packing , the catering and restaurant trade to nursing and domestic work .
prof craig said many large british companies relied on people working in slavery conditions to produce the goods they sold .
he said the complex nature of supply chains made it feasible for the company at the top of the chain to deny any knowledge of working conditions at the bottom .
prof craig said everyone needed to ask ' awkward questions ' but , he said : " it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in . "
the university of hull 's wise researchers documented cases of exploitation for an extensive study into modern slavery in the uk , co-written by anti-slavery international and commissioned by the york-based joseph rowntree foundation .
dr mick wilkinson said he met a latvian woman who had been charged £ 100 to sign up to an employment agency .
he said : " she was transported from hull to barnsley in a vehicle , she was then working eight-hour night shifts , she was sleeping two hours in the car and being woken up to work an eight-hour morning shift , and then transported back to hull . "
deductions for administration and transport were made from her wages and any complaints were met with threats of being sacked and losing her accommodation .
" we are talking about people in these conditions who are regularly working 70 hours a week and are pocketing £ 50 , " dr wilkinson said .

in every city and every rural area of this region there are people working in slavery conditions professor gary craig , wise the associate director of the wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation -lrb- wise -rrb- said in the yorkshire and humber region alone , there were hundreds if not thousands of people living and working in slavery conditions .
sex slavery of women and children , as well as forced labour and debt bondage were all present in the region and across the uk , he said .
prof craig said : " slavery is very much alive and well in yorkshire today .
" in every city and every rural area of this region there are people who are working in slavery conditions . "
hot-bedding wise says there are thousands of modern slaves in the uk studies have put the net benefit to the uk economy of migrant workers at between £ 2bn and £ 3bn per year .
but prof craig said research showed these workers often worked for less pay , longer basic hours , with no sick pay , paid holiday , or written contract covering hours , conditions , pay and dismissal procedures .
most were unaware of their rights and lived in " poor to appalling " accommodation , often six or more mixed-sex to a room , sometimes operating a " hot-bed " system , with workers sharing beds according to shift patterns .
in many cases , workers were forced deeply into debt by their employers and this , coupled with threats of violence , kept them working in " absolutely appalling " , slave-like conditions .
there are up to 90,000 migrant workers in the yorkshire and humber region alone .
' barely credible ' it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in prof gary craig , wise prof craig said : " all of us need to ask awkward questions .
" are the newly-arrived migrants - serving us , supporting our job , working alongside us , living down the street - getting access to appropriate housing and employment conditions ?
" if not , we should protest , complain , report .
" many of us are too happy to enjoy the fruits of their labour but not pay an appropriate price for it . "
areas where exploitation occured ranged from agricultural work to food processing and packing , the catering and restaurant trade to nursing and domestic work .
prof craig said many large british companies relied on people working in slavery conditions to produce the goods they sold .
he said the complex nature of supply chains made it feasible for the company at the top of the chain to deny any knowledge of working conditions at the bottom .
prof craig said everyone needed to ask ' awkward questions ' but , he said : " it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in . "
the university of hull 's wise researchers documented cases of exploitation for an extensive study into modern slavery in the uk , co-written by anti-slavery international and commissioned by the york-based joseph rowntree foundation .
dr mick wilkinson said he met a latvian woman who had been charged £ 100 to sign up to an employment agency .
he said : " she was transported from hull to barnsley in a vehicle , she was then working eight-hour night shifts , she was sleeping two hours in the car and being woken up to work an eight-hour morning shift , and then transported back to hull . "
deductions for administration and transport were made from her wages and any complaints were met with threats of being sacked and losing her accommodation .
" we are talking about people in these conditions who are regularly working 70 hours a week and are pocketing £ 50 , " dr wilkinson said .

researchers from hull 's wilberforce institute say thousands of migrant workers in the uk are being severely exploited by unscrupulous employers .
many of them work under such a level of exploitation it meets the international definition of " forced labour " .
" we are all compromised by slavery " , professor gary craig said .
in every city and every rural area of this region there are people working in slavery conditions professor gary craig , wise the associate director of the wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation -lrb- wise -rrb- said in the yorkshire and humber region alone , there were hundreds if not thousands of people living and working in slavery conditions .
sex slavery of women and children , as well as forced labour and debt bondage were all present in the region and across the uk , he said .
prof craig said : " slavery is very much alive and well in yorkshire today .
" in every city and every rural area of this region there are people who are working in slavery conditions . "
hot-bedding wise says there are thousands of modern slaves in the uk studies have put the net benefit to the uk economy of migrant workers at between £ 2bn and £ 3bn per year .
but prof craig said research showed these workers often worked for less pay , longer basic hours , with no sick pay , paid holiday , or written contract covering hours , conditions , pay and dismissal procedures .
most were unaware of their rights and lived in " poor to appalling " accommodation , often six or more mixed-sex to a room , sometimes operating a " hot-bed " system , with workers sharing beds according to shift patterns .
in many cases , workers were forced deeply into debt by their employers and this , coupled with threats of violence , kept them working in " absolutely appalling " , slave-like conditions .
there are up to 90,000 migrant workers in the yorkshire and humber region alone .
' barely credible ' it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in prof gary craig , wise prof craig said : " all of us need to ask awkward questions .
" are the newly-arrived migrants - serving us , supporting our job , working alongside us , living down the street - getting access to appropriate housing and employment conditions ?
" if not , we should protest , complain , report .
" many of us are too happy to enjoy the fruits of their labour but not pay an appropriate price for it . "
areas where exploitation occured ranged from agricultural work to food processing and packing , the catering and restaurant trade to nursing and domestic work .
prof craig said many large british companies relied on people working in slavery conditions to produce the goods they sold .
he said the complex nature of supply chains made it feasible for the company at the top of the chain to deny any knowledge of working conditions at the bottom .
prof craig said everyone needed to ask ' awkward questions ' but , he said : " it is barely credible for these big companies to say that they do n't know about the conditions that people are working in . "
the university of hull 's wise researchers documented cases of exploitation for an extensive study into modern slavery in the uk , co-written by anti-slavery international and commissioned by the york-based joseph rowntree foundation .
dr mick wilkinson said he met a latvian woman who had been charged £ 100 to sign up to an employment agency .
he said : " she was transported from hull to barnsley in a vehicle , she was then working eight-hour night shifts , she was sleeping two hours in the car and being woken up to work an eight-hour morning shift , and then transported back to hull . "
deductions for administration and transport were made from her wages and any complaints were met with threats of being sacked and losing her accommodation .
" we are talking about people in these conditions who are regularly working 70 hours a week and are pocketing £ 50 , " dr wilkinson said .

" although i am now free , i am depressed .
i will never forget what they did to me . "
coming from a poor family in albania , maria was just 13 years old when she was sold by her sister to a man she did not know and taken to italy by boat .
" i did not know where i was going .
once we arrived in italy i was sold again , to a different man .
he took me to a house and raped me , " she said .
' practical support ' as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which led to the abolition of the slave trade , there is evidence that slavery continues in this country , including cases like maria 's .
maria was taken away by the police who took her to a nunnery for protection after neighbours overheard her screaming .
she returned home after two years , but four days later she was sold again to another man - by her father .
she was taken back to italy where she was kept prisoner and was smuggled into the uk in a lorry .
maria ended up " working " in london for five years .
" i worked every day , seeing 65 to 70 customers a day .
i could earn up to £ 1,000 per day , but i had to pay £ 400 every day in ' rent ' and £ 60 for a maid , as well as 20 % of everything else i earned .
eventually she managed to escape with other women in the house by running away with the owner 's boyfriend .
they then went to the police who introduced her to the poppy project , one of only two refuges for trafficked women in the uk .
set up in 2003 as a pilot project by south-london based charity eaves housing for women , the poppy project helps women aged 18 to 25 who have been trafficked to the uk .
what is clear is that there has been a massive increase in the sex industry such as lap dancing clubs , saunas and massage parlours which are fuelling the trade in trafficked women julie barton , poppy project team leader due to funding from the home office and london councils -lrb- formerly the association of london government -rrb- it gives trafficked women practical support , and provides them with clothes and toiletries , accommodation , education and healthcare .
the majority of the women who come to the project are from eastern europe , particularly from lithuania and albania , however the project has seen a recent increase in the number of women from china and west africa .
" when the women come to us they are confused , frightened , afraid of their and their families ' safety and are very angry , " said poppy project team leader julie barton .
" they want to know that they and their family will be safe , that 's their primary concern .
but they are also concerned about having to return home , so hope that they will be granted leave to remain in the uk . "
unfortunately 99 % of women who are trafficked tend to be refused stay in the uk , but on appeal 80 % of women win their cases , says ms barton .
in january this year the home office increased their support to the project by providing further funding for outreach .
' right direction ' further funding has also enabled the project to increase the number of bed spaces and women they can support from 25 to 35 .
the project is unfortunately unable to help all the women who are referred to it , mainly because of criteria that is laid down .
from the launch of the project to january 2007 , statistics collated by the project reveal that of 581 who are referred to the project 127 received accommodation and support and 33 received outreach .
ms barton says that the police and the government are aware that there needs to be more focus on helping women who are trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry , but says " things are heading in the right direction " .
the number of massage parlours are increasing across london the metropolitan police 's operation maxim unit deals with human trafficking but generally targets organised immigration crime of all kinds across london .
but earlier this month the met launched a new unit to specifically crack down on human trafficking to london .
the 11-strong unit will also work with charities and voluntary groups to help victims of sex exploitation .
current estimates are that between 4,000 and 8,000 women per year are trafficked into the uk and forced to work in the multi-million-pound sex industry .
ms barton told bbc news online : " statistics reveal that the number of women trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry has risen .
but it is not clear whether this is because the number of women being trafficked has increased or if more and more cases are being reported .
" but what is clear is that there has been a massive increase in the sex industry such as lap dancing clubs , saunas and massage parlours which are fuelling the trade in trafficked women . "

she returned home after two years , but four days later she was sold again to another man - by her father .
she was taken back to italy where she was kept prisoner and was smuggled into the uk in a lorry .
maria ended up " working " in london for five years .
" i worked every day , seeing 65 to 70 customers a day .
i could earn up to £ 1,000 per day , but i had to pay £ 400 every day in ' rent ' and £ 60 for a maid , as well as 20 % of everything else i earned .
eventually she managed to escape with other women in the house by running away with the owner 's boyfriend .
they then went to the police who introduced her to the poppy project , one of only two refuges for trafficked women in the uk .
set up in 2003 as a pilot project by south-london based charity eaves housing for women , the poppy project helps women aged 18 to 25 who have been trafficked to the uk .
what is clear is that there has been a massive increase in the sex industry such as lap dancing clubs , saunas and massage parlours which are fuelling the trade in trafficked women julie barton , poppy project team leader due to funding from the home office and london councils -lrb- formerly the association of london government -rrb- it gives trafficked women practical support , and provides them with clothes and toiletries , accommodation , education and healthcare .
the majority of the women who come to the project are from eastern europe , particularly from lithuania and albania , however the project has seen a recent increase in the number of women from china and west africa .
" when the women come to us they are confused , frightened , afraid of their and their families ' safety and are very angry , " said poppy project team leader julie barton .
" they want to know that they and their family will be safe , that 's their primary concern .
but they are also concerned about having to return home , so hope that they will be granted leave to remain in the uk . "
unfortunately 99 % of women who are trafficked tend to be refused stay in the uk , but on appeal 80 % of women win their cases , says ms barton .
in january this year the home office increased their support to the project by providing further funding for outreach .
' right direction ' further funding has also enabled the project to increase the number of bed spaces and women they can support from 25 to 35 .
the project is unfortunately unable to help all the women who are referred to it , mainly because of criteria that is laid down .
from the launch of the project to january 2007 , statistics collated by the project reveal that of 581 who are referred to the project 127 received accommodation and support and 33 received outreach .
ms barton says that the police and the government are aware that there needs to be more focus on helping women who are trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry , but says " things are heading in the right direction " .
the number of massage parlours are increasing across london the metropolitan police 's operation maxim unit deals with human trafficking but generally targets organised immigration crime of all kinds across london .
but earlier this month the met launched a new unit to specifically crack down on human trafficking to london .
the 11-strong unit will also work with charities and voluntary groups to help victims of sex exploitation .
current estimates are that between 4,000 and 8,000 women per year are trafficked into the uk and forced to work in the multi-million-pound sex industry .
ms barton told bbc news online : " statistics reveal that the number of women trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry has risen .
but it is not clear whether this is because the number of women being trafficked has increased or if more and more cases are being reported .
" but what is clear is that there has been a massive increase in the sex industry such as lap dancing clubs , saunas and massage parlours which are fuelling the trade in trafficked women . "

" although i am now free , i am depressed .
i will never forget what they did to me . "
coming from a poor family in albania , maria was just 13 years old when she was sold by her sister to a man she did not know and taken to italy by boat .
" i did not know where i was going .
once we arrived in italy i was sold again , to a different man .
he took me to a house and raped me , " she said .
' practical support ' as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which led to the abolition of the slave trade , there is evidence that slavery continues in this country , including cases like maria 's .
maria was taken away by the police who took her to a nunnery for protection after neighbours overheard her screaming .
she returned home after two years , but four days later she was sold again to another man - by her father .
she was taken back to italy where she was kept prisoner and was smuggled into the uk in a lorry .
maria ended up " working " in london for five years .
" i worked every day , seeing 65 to 70 customers a day .
i could earn up to £ 1,000 per day , but i had to pay £ 400 every day in ' rent ' and £ 60 for a maid , as well as 20 % of everything else i earned .
eventually she managed to escape with other women in the house by running away with the owner 's boyfriend .
they then went to the police who introduced her to the poppy project , one of only two refuges for trafficked women in the uk .
set up in 2003 as a pilot project by south-london based charity eaves housing for women , the poppy project helps women aged 18 to 25 who have been trafficked to the uk .
what is clear is that there has been a massive increase in the sex industry such as lap dancing clubs , saunas and massage parlours which are fuelling the trade in trafficked women julie barton , poppy project team leader due to funding from the home office and london councils -lrb- formerly the association of london government -rrb- it gives trafficked women practical support , and provides them with clothes and toiletries , accommodation , education and healthcare .
the majority of the women who come to the project are from eastern europe , particularly from lithuania and albania , however the project has seen a recent increase in the number of women from china and west africa .
" when the women come to us they are confused , frightened , afraid of their and their families ' safety and are very angry , " said poppy project team leader julie barton .
" they want to know that they and their family will be safe , that 's their primary concern .
but they are also concerned about having to return home , so hope that they will be granted leave to remain in the uk . "
unfortunately 99 % of women who are trafficked tend to be refused stay in the uk , but on appeal 80 % of women win their cases , says ms barton .
in january this year the home office increased their support to the project by providing further funding for outreach .
' right direction ' further funding has also enabled the project to increase the number of bed spaces and women they can support from 25 to 35 .
the project is unfortunately unable to help all the women who are referred to it , mainly because of criteria that is laid down .
from the launch of the project to january 2007 , statistics collated by the project reveal that of 581 who are referred to the project 127 received accommodation and support and 33 received outreach .
ms barton says that the police and the government are aware that there needs to be more focus on helping women who are trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry , but says " things are heading in the right direction " .
the number of massage parlours are increasing across london the metropolitan police 's operation maxim unit deals with human trafficking but generally targets organised immigration crime of all kinds across london .
but earlier this month the met launched a new unit to specifically crack down on human trafficking to london .
the 11-strong unit will also work with charities and voluntary groups to help victims of sex exploitation .
current estimates are that between 4,000 and 8,000 women per year are trafficked into the uk and forced to work in the multi-million-pound sex industry .
ms barton told bbc news online : " statistics reveal that the number of women trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry has risen .

eventually she managed to escape with other women in the house by running away with the owner 's boyfriend .
they then went to the police who introduced her to the poppy project , one of only two refuges for trafficked women in the uk .
set up in 2003 as a pilot project by south-london based charity eaves housing for women , the poppy project helps women aged 18 to 25 who have been trafficked to the uk .
what is clear is that there has been a massive increase in the sex industry such as lap dancing clubs , saunas and massage parlours which are fuelling the trade in trafficked women julie barton , poppy project team leader due to funding from the home office and london councils -lrb- formerly the association of london government -rrb- it gives trafficked women practical support , and provides them with clothes and toiletries , accommodation , education and healthcare .
the majority of the women who come to the project are from eastern europe , particularly from lithuania and albania , however the project has seen a recent increase in the number of women from china and west africa .
" when the women come to us they are confused , frightened , afraid of their and their families ' safety and are very angry , " said poppy project team leader julie barton .
" they want to know that they and their family will be safe , that 's their primary concern .
but they are also concerned about having to return home , so hope that they will be granted leave to remain in the uk . "
unfortunately 99 % of women who are trafficked tend to be refused stay in the uk , but on appeal 80 % of women win their cases , says ms barton .
in january this year the home office increased their support to the project by providing further funding for outreach .
' right direction ' further funding has also enabled the project to increase the number of bed spaces and women they can support from 25 to 35 .
the project is unfortunately unable to help all the women who are referred to it , mainly because of criteria that is laid down .
from the launch of the project to january 2007 , statistics collated by the project reveal that of 581 who are referred to the project 127 received accommodation and support and 33 received outreach .
ms barton says that the police and the government are aware that there needs to be more focus on helping women who are trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry , but says " things are heading in the right direction " .
the number of massage parlours are increasing across london the metropolitan police 's operation maxim unit deals with human trafficking but generally targets organised immigration crime of all kinds across london .
but earlier this month the met launched a new unit to specifically crack down on human trafficking to london .
the 11-strong unit will also work with charities and voluntary groups to help victims of sex exploitation .
current estimates are that between 4,000 and 8,000 women per year are trafficked into the uk and forced to work in the multi-million-pound sex industry .
ms barton told bbc news online : " statistics reveal that the number of women trafficked into the uk to work in the sex industry has risen .
but it is not clear whether this is because the number of women being trafficked has increased or if more and more cases are being reported .
" but what is clear is that there has been a massive increase in the sex industry such as lap dancing clubs , saunas and massage parlours which are fuelling the trade in trafficked women . "

although ultimately nobody was prosecuted for a people trafficking-related offence in the case , the woman was placed with a support organisation in the north-east of england after she was found to have " fitted the criteria of a trafficking victim for the purposes of being housed " .
it is the kind of situation which has led sussex police to actively dedicate more resources towards tackling the problem of sexual exploitation .
det sgt jon gross is the man who took on the task last november through a new role in the specialist investigations branch .
as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , he spoke to the bbc news website about police efforts to uncover and disrupt the sex slave industry , and the role of gatwick airport in the cross-border trade .
police education " since december 2006 , sussex police has responded to information concerning potentially exploited women working in brothels on an almost weekly basis , " det sgt gross said .
" we are trying to scope the scale of the problem and how best we can identify it .
" there will be victims of trafficking in every area , but the problem is that it 's hidden within communities .
" unless a force is set up to look for it , you wo n't necessarily find it . "
does it look like the girls are potentially being locked in at night and held against their will ?
det sgt jon gross det sgt gross said his brief was to educate officers on how to police people trafficking into , for example , prostitution or forced labour " in the event that sussex mounts an investigation " .
he said that because victims of sexual exploitation were " the most difficult group of victims to identify " , the most important thing was training people to spot the warning signs .
" they could say willingly that they are ok , but they may be afraid of the traffickers .
" but there are things to look for when you are doing a search of a premises .
" does it look like the girls are potentially being locked in at night and held against their will ?
what are the amenities they 've got there ?
all these type of things would raise the alarm . "
support organisations the police 's efforts are being supported by other agencies and organisations , such as the citylight service in brighton and hove .
set up by naomi cohen and other church volunteers in the city , the project currently offers a weekly telephone support line for sex workers .
mrs cohen said the ultimate aim , if a need was identified , would be to set up an outreach and accommodation service for trafficked women .
" we want to be an outside body that comes alongside the police , who the women can talk to and hopefully feel comfortable with .
" they have to go through questioning and they will be housed by the police for a few days while all this is happening .
brighton and hove could be a city with a hidden sex slave trade " we will come in to wherever they are - a hostel or hotel - and check they 're ok , that they 've got food and clothing .
" if there are women in sussex that have gone though this , it 's an awful thing and we want to be part of helping them to recover . "
mrs cohen said she got involved after being shocked by some of the stories around trafficking into prostitution .
" it was the abuse and deception , " she said .
" stories of families handing their daughters over , a best friend sending someone 's wife to be trafficked .
" it horrifies me that this is happening in this day and age when most of us have our freedom .
" i just wanted to be a part of something that changes that and can help women to rebuild their lives . "
det sgt gross said : " any group like citylight is going to have an important role to play .
" if they are offering support visits and mentoring in the first few days -lsb- after a woman has been rescued from forced prostitution -rsb- , that 's fantastic for us . "
gatwick airport det sgt gross said his work also involved identifying points of entry in sussex for traffickers bringing foreign women into the country .
" there are many routes in via road , air and rail , and any number of marinas around our coastal boundaries .
" we have newhaven port and shoreham airport , but gatwick airport is ' the biggie ' and has implications for us and the country as a whole . "
indeed there have been several trafficking cases prosecuted in recent years where gatwick played a major role .
' pick up intelligence ' three people were jailed in 2005 after two young lithuanian women escaped from forced prostitution in sheffield and london - they had been sold for £ 3,000 each during a " sex slave auction " in a coffee house at the sussex airport .
in december last year , seven people were convicted of trafficking two eastern european women who were forced to work as prostitutes in coventry after arriving at gatwick .
three people were jailed for selling slaves in a coffee shop at gatwick and two more men were jailed in february after lithuanian women were picked up from gatwick and forced to work in the sex industry in birmingham and cardiff .
" gatwick needs to be a priority , " det sgt gross admitted .
" it would be difficult to speculate how much -lsb- trafficking -rsb- comes through there .
" we need to improve the mechanisms already in place for translating intelligence into operational activity .
" we are meeting regularly with our colleagues from heathrow , stansted and dover in an effort to share best practice .
" this sort of liason really assists in the drive to identify victims and thwart the traffickers at the points of entry into the uk .
" we just need to push it forward a bit . "

" we are trying to scope the scale of the problem and how best we can identify it .
" there will be victims of trafficking in every area , but the problem is that it 's hidden within communities .
" unless a force is set up to look for it , you wo n't necessarily find it . "
does it look like the girls are potentially being locked in at night and held against their will ?
det sgt jon gross det sgt gross said his brief was to educate officers on how to police people trafficking into , for example , prostitution or forced labour " in the event that sussex mounts an investigation " .
he said that because victims of sexual exploitation were " the most difficult group of victims to identify " , the most important thing was training people to spot the warning signs .
" they could say willingly that they are ok , but they may be afraid of the traffickers .
" but there are things to look for when you are doing a search of a premises .
" does it look like the girls are potentially being locked in at night and held against their will ?
what are the amenities they 've got there ?
all these type of things would raise the alarm . "
support organisations the police 's efforts are being supported by other agencies and organisations , such as the citylight service in brighton and hove .
set up by naomi cohen and other church volunteers in the city , the project currently offers a weekly telephone support line for sex workers .
mrs cohen said the ultimate aim , if a need was identified , would be to set up an outreach and accommodation service for trafficked women .
" we want to be an outside body that comes alongside the police , who the women can talk to and hopefully feel comfortable with .
" they have to go through questioning and they will be housed by the police for a few days while all this is happening .
brighton and hove could be a city with a hidden sex slave trade " we will come in to wherever they are - a hostel or hotel - and check they 're ok , that they 've got food and clothing .
" if there are women in sussex that have gone though this , it 's an awful thing and we want to be part of helping them to recover . "
mrs cohen said she got involved after being shocked by some of the stories around trafficking into prostitution .
" it was the abuse and deception , " she said .
" stories of families handing their daughters over , a best friend sending someone 's wife to be trafficked .
" it horrifies me that this is happening in this day and age when most of us have our freedom .
" i just wanted to be a part of something that changes that and can help women to rebuild their lives . "
det sgt gross said : " any group like citylight is going to have an important role to play .
" if they are offering support visits and mentoring in the first few days -lsb- after a woman has been rescued from forced prostitution -rsb- , that 's fantastic for us . "
gatwick airport det sgt gross said his work also involved identifying points of entry in sussex for traffickers bringing foreign women into the country .
" there are many routes in via road , air and rail , and any number of marinas around our coastal boundaries .
" we have newhaven port and shoreham airport , but gatwick airport is ' the biggie ' and has implications for us and the country as a whole . "
indeed there have been several trafficking cases prosecuted in recent years where gatwick played a major role .
' pick up intelligence ' three people were jailed in 2005 after two young lithuanian women escaped from forced prostitution in sheffield and london - they had been sold for £ 3,000 each during a " sex slave auction " in a coffee house at the sussex airport .
in december last year , seven people were convicted of trafficking two eastern european women who were forced to work as prostitutes in coventry after arriving at gatwick .
three people were jailed for selling slaves in a coffee shop at gatwick and two more men were jailed in february after lithuanian women were picked up from gatwick and forced to work in the sex industry in birmingham and cardiff .
" gatwick needs to be a priority , " det sgt gross admitted .
" it would be difficult to speculate how much -lsb- trafficking -rsb- comes through there .
" we need to improve the mechanisms already in place for translating intelligence into operational activity .
" we are meeting regularly with our colleagues from heathrow , stansted and dover in an effort to share best practice .
" this sort of liason really assists in the drive to identify victims and thwart the traffickers at the points of entry into the uk .

although ultimately nobody was prosecuted for a people trafficking-related offence in the case , the woman was placed with a support organisation in the north-east of england after she was found to have " fitted the criteria of a trafficking victim for the purposes of being housed " .
it is the kind of situation which has led sussex police to actively dedicate more resources towards tackling the problem of sexual exploitation .
det sgt jon gross is the man who took on the task last november through a new role in the specialist investigations branch .
as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , he spoke to the bbc news website about police efforts to uncover and disrupt the sex slave industry , and the role of gatwick airport in the cross-border trade .
police education " since december 2006 , sussex police has responded to information concerning potentially exploited women working in brothels on an almost weekly basis , " det sgt gross said .
" we are trying to scope the scale of the problem and how best we can identify it .
" there will be victims of trafficking in every area , but the problem is that it 's hidden within communities .
" unless a force is set up to look for it , you wo n't necessarily find it . "
does it look like the girls are potentially being locked in at night and held against their will ?
det sgt jon gross det sgt gross said his brief was to educate officers on how to police people trafficking into , for example , prostitution or forced labour " in the event that sussex mounts an investigation " .
he said that because victims of sexual exploitation were " the most difficult group of victims to identify " , the most important thing was training people to spot the warning signs .
" they could say willingly that they are ok , but they may be afraid of the traffickers .
" but there are things to look for when you are doing a search of a premises .

all these type of things would raise the alarm . "
support organisations the police 's efforts are being supported by other agencies and organisations , such as the citylight service in brighton and hove .
set up by naomi cohen and other church volunteers in the city , the project currently offers a weekly telephone support line for sex workers .
mrs cohen said the ultimate aim , if a need was identified , would be to set up an outreach and accommodation service for trafficked women .
" we want to be an outside body that comes alongside the police , who the women can talk to and hopefully feel comfortable with .
" they have to go through questioning and they will be housed by the police for a few days while all this is happening .
brighton and hove could be a city with a hidden sex slave trade " we will come in to wherever they are - a hostel or hotel - and check they 're ok , that they 've got food and clothing .
" if there are women in sussex that have gone though this , it 's an awful thing and we want to be part of helping them to recover . "
mrs cohen said she got involved after being shocked by some of the stories around trafficking into prostitution .
" it was the abuse and deception , " she said .
" stories of families handing their daughters over , a best friend sending someone 's wife to be trafficked .
" it horrifies me that this is happening in this day and age when most of us have our freedom .
" i just wanted to be a part of something that changes that and can help women to rebuild their lives . "
det sgt gross said : " any group like citylight is going to have an important role to play .
" if they are offering support visits and mentoring in the first few days -lsb- after a woman has been rescued from forced prostitution -rsb- , that 's fantastic for us . "

" there are many routes in via road , air and rail , and any number of marinas around our coastal boundaries .
" we have newhaven port and shoreham airport , but gatwick airport is ' the biggie ' and has implications for us and the country as a whole . "
indeed there have been several trafficking cases prosecuted in recent years where gatwick played a major role .
' pick up intelligence ' three people were jailed in 2005 after two young lithuanian women escaped from forced prostitution in sheffield and london - they had been sold for £ 3,000 each during a " sex slave auction " in a coffee house at the sussex airport .
in december last year , seven people were convicted of trafficking two eastern european women who were forced to work as prostitutes in coventry after arriving at gatwick .
three people were jailed for selling slaves in a coffee shop at gatwick and two more men were jailed in february after lithuanian women were picked up from gatwick and forced to work in the sex industry in birmingham and cardiff .

the operation was part of the national operation pentameter , which aims to tackle exploitation within the sex industry .
today the fight against sex trafficking continues as officers from the devon and cornwall force share information with other forces around the uk .
the uk human trafficking centre -lrb- ukhtc -rrb- in sheffield , europe 's first dedicated centre for victims of people-trafficking , was created in october last year .
it brings together a number of agencies including care organisations and the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- to tackle 21st century slavery , as the uk marks 200 years since the parliamentary act which to abolish the slave trade .
det insp martin warren of soca in devon and cornwall said that since the introduction of the ukhtc , work had been stepped up to identify and care for victims of human trafficking , which was now " commonplace " in the west country .
victims are often reluctant to go to the authorities , fearing retribution det insp martin warren he said : " it is a fact the criminal networks involved do not limit their activity into the country 's urban areas and the force recognises the need to take action within its own boundaries .
" the blatant exploitation of vulnerable people is totally contrary to normal social values in this country .
" people that get involved can expect some intervention by police at some stage . "
he admitted that although the police accepted the illegal trade in humanity was now common in the region , the force faced difficulties unearthing victims .
medija was betrayed by a boyfriend who forced her into the sex industry " victims are often reluctant to go to the authorities , fearing retribution from their captors against them or even their families in their country of origin , so you do have a situation where it is difficult to get to the bottom of cases . "
the poppy project in london is one of the care organisations that works with the ukhtc , and has provided safe accommodation for victims of sex trafficking from the west country .
nineteen-year-old medija , from albania , is one such victim and this is her story : before i was trafficked , i lived in a small town in albania with my family .
i left school when i was 14 so i could work in the market with my father .
he was very worried all the time about money , and sometimes he would hit me .
while i was working i met a man called guri .
he said he had seen me around and liked me .
he became my boyfriend .
' disowned me ' my parents did not approve and said i must choose between him and them .
i decided to go and live with guri , as i was tired of living in a small house .
after a few months he said he wanted to take me to live in italy .
i did n't want to go but my family had disowned me so i had no choice .
i agreed to go .
guri paid for my travel and we travelled by speedboat to italy , where he gave me false italian travel documents .
he said i would need them because the uk authorities were prejudiced against albanians .
from italy we travelled across europe by coach to the uk , where we were met by a friend of guri 's .
he drove us to a house .
that 's when they told me that i would be working as a prostitute .
i screamed and cried and refused .
they beat me badly and raped me , and told me i had no choice .
it was true .
i was exhausted and often in pain medija i had sex with between five and ten men every day , seven days a week , working in saunas during the day and massage parlours some nights .
i was exhausted and often in pain , from all the men and from the beatings .
i had no contact with my family and i was locked in the house all the time , only let out to go to work .
i lived like this for six months until the police raided the sauna .
they took me to the poppy project , who gave me shelter and are helping me recover from my experiences .

i am afraid of people and do not like to leave the house .
i do n't trust anybody .
i sometimes drink too much , to help me forget what happened .
but it does n't work .
i will never forget what those men did to me .
heather sable of plymouth-based devon and cornwall refugee support council , said medija 's plight was " just the tip of the iceberg " of human suffering created by human trafficking in the region .
each week she and her volunteer workers tackle about 100 cases a week of refugees for whom a paid human trafficker was the only way to get out of their country of origin and into the uk .
provision of false passports and travel documents all came as part of the illicit trade in humans .
the result when refugees appear in the uk is often not what they expected .

" i know at least two people that have got into prostitution out of destitution , " she said .

the poppy project in london is one of the care organisations that works with the ukhtc , and has provided safe accommodation for victims of sex trafficking from the west country .
nineteen-year-old medija , from albania , is one such victim and this is her story : before i was trafficked , i lived in a small town in albania with my family .
i left school when i was 14 so i could work in the market with my father .
he was very worried all the time about money , and sometimes he would hit me .
while i was working i met a man called guri .
he said he had seen me around and liked me .
he became my boyfriend .
' disowned me ' my parents did not approve and said i must choose between him and them .
i decided to go and live with guri , as i was tired of living in a small house .
after a few months he said he wanted to take me to live in italy .
i did n't want to go but my family had disowned me so i had no choice .
i agreed to go .
guri paid for my travel and we travelled by speedboat to italy , where he gave me false italian travel documents .
he said i would need them because the uk authorities were prejudiced against albanians .
from italy we travelled across europe by coach to the uk , where we were met by a friend of guri 's .
he drove us to a house .
that 's when they told me that i would be working as a prostitute .
i screamed and cried and refused .
they beat me badly and raped me , and told me i had no choice .
it was true .
i was exhausted and often in pain medija i had sex with between five and ten men every day , seven days a week , working in saunas during the day and massage parlours some nights .
i was exhausted and often in pain , from all the men and from the beatings .
i had no contact with my family and i was locked in the house all the time , only let out to go to work .
i lived like this for six months until the police raided the sauna .
they took me to the poppy project , who gave me shelter and are helping me recover from my experiences .
i still have many problems .
i ca n't sleep and have nightmares , and sometimes i have panic attacks .
i am afraid of people and do not like to leave the house .
i do n't trust anybody .
i sometimes drink too much , to help me forget what happened .
but it does n't work .
i will never forget what those men did to me .
heather sable of plymouth-based devon and cornwall refugee support council , said medija 's plight was " just the tip of the iceberg " of human suffering created by human trafficking in the region .
each week she and her volunteer workers tackle about 100 cases a week of refugees for whom a paid human trafficker was the only way to get out of their country of origin and into the uk .
provision of false passports and travel documents all came as part of the illicit trade in humans .
the result when refugees appear in the uk is often not what they expected .
' fine line ' refused asylum and relying partly on handouts , some fall prey to prostitution to make ends meet .
" i know at least two people that have got into prostitution out of destitution , " she said .
" there is a fine line between human trafficking and asylum seekers . "
following the raid in truro last year , two 28-year-old east european men were cautioned by police for sexual offences .
last december , 61-year-old philip mepham , of killivose road , camborne appeared at truro crown court and admitted managing or assisting the management of a brothel .
he was fined £ 2,000 and ordered to pay £ 500 costs .
the court heard that the two lithuanian women had been working at the brothel .
one had left the area and the other had returned to lithuania .

medija was betrayed by a boyfriend who forced her into the sex industry " victims are often reluctant to go to the authorities , fearing retribution from their captors against them or even their families in their country of origin , so you do have a situation where it is difficult to get to the bottom of cases . "
the poppy project in london is one of the care organisations that works with the ukhtc , and has provided safe accommodation for victims of sex trafficking from the west country .
nineteen-year-old medija , from albania , is one such victim and this is her story : before i was trafficked , i lived in a small town in albania with my family .
i left school when i was 14 so i could work in the market with my father .
he was very worried all the time about money , and sometimes he would hit me .
while i was working i met a man called guri .
he said he had seen me around and liked me .
he became my boyfriend .
' disowned me ' my parents did not approve and said i must choose between him and them .
i decided to go and live with guri , as i was tired of living in a small house .
after a few months he said he wanted to take me to live in italy .
i did n't want to go but my family had disowned me so i had no choice .
i agreed to go .
guri paid for my travel and we travelled by speedboat to italy , where he gave me false italian travel documents .
he said i would need them because the uk authorities were prejudiced against albanians .
from italy we travelled across europe by coach to the uk , where we were met by a friend of guri 's .
he drove us to a house .
that 's when they told me that i would be working as a prostitute .
i screamed and cried and refused .
they beat me badly and raped me , and told me i had no choice .
it was true .
i was exhausted and often in pain medija i had sex with between five and ten men every day , seven days a week , working in saunas during the day and massage parlours some nights .
i was exhausted and often in pain , from all the men and from the beatings .
i had no contact with my family and i was locked in the house all the time , only let out to go to work .
i lived like this for six months until the police raided the sauna .
they took me to the poppy project , who gave me shelter and are helping me recover from my experiences .
i still have many problems .
i ca n't sleep and have nightmares , and sometimes i have panic attacks .
i am afraid of people and do not like to leave the house .
i do n't trust anybody .
i sometimes drink too much , to help me forget what happened .
but it does n't work .
i will never forget what those men did to me .
heather sable of plymouth-based devon and cornwall refugee support council , said medija 's plight was " just the tip of the iceberg " of human suffering created by human trafficking in the region .
each week she and her volunteer workers tackle about 100 cases a week of refugees for whom a paid human trafficker was the only way to get out of their country of origin and into the uk .
provision of false passports and travel documents all came as part of the illicit trade in humans .
the result when refugees appear in the uk is often not what they expected .
' fine line ' refused asylum and relying partly on handouts , some fall prey to prostitution to make ends meet .
" i know at least two people that have got into prostitution out of destitution , " she said .
" there is a fine line between human trafficking and asylum seekers . "
following the raid in truro last year , two 28-year-old east european men were cautioned by police for sexual offences .

the court heard that the two lithuanian women had been working at the brothel .
one had left the area and the other had returned to lithuania .

with the west africa squadron , the 26-year-old midshipman is on one of the royal navy 's fleet of ships tasked to stop the trade of slaves , in the wake of laws to abolish the transatlantic trade .
ch binstead records in his personal diary : " observed many large canoes , one of which i went in chase of , on my coming up with her the whole crew jumped overboard and i fear they have met a watery grave , these poor wretches were fearful we were going to make slaves of them . "
west africa squadron spanned 1808 - 1860s approx .
150,000 slaves were freed 1,600 ships were seized approx .
2,000 men died on the squadron sailor 's slavery diary displayed later he adds : " i never witnessed a more horrid description than my messmates gave me of the wretched state they were in aboard , actually dying 10-12 a day owing to the confinement below all the men are in irons and women under them by a small petition . "
his tales form a rare record of the royal navy 's mission to stop the illegal transportation of slaves along the african coast .
the task began in 1808 but although the navy 's initial 50-year campaign ended , its interception and destruction of human trafficking has not .
' why west africa ? '
back to 2007 , and hms enterprise is at sea off the west african coast .
at the time the uk is marking the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which led to the abolition of the slave trade , the crew 's task involves updating maps of the coastline , some of which have not been updated since they were drawn up by ch binstead 's colleagues .
in a blog , crew members recall why they are taking part in a research trip to that coastline : " some have asked " why west africa " ?
well the list includes , commonwealth , collaborative work , the threat from piracy , anti-drug work , contributions to countering illegal human trafficking , offshore oil installation security ... "
countering illegal human trafficking falls under the modern navy 's maritime security operations .
research ship hms enterprise is stationed off nigeria " firstly , today 's navy is designed to fight warfare , " lt cmdr bill lauste said .
" but as part of this , it enables it to conduct humanitarian relief - maritime security operations , to do with illegal use of the sea .
" we 've always got ships in the caribbean , west africa , mediterranean , gulf , horn of africa etc - areas subject to natural disaster and on the manmade side ships have tendered assistance to boats loaded with people being smuggled . "
" hms illustrious and hms scott tendered assistance saving many hundreds of lives . "
' diplomatic debate ' the navy 's powers to stop and search were queried with the west africa squadron .
" in the early days there was this fear , particularly from the american navy because obviously we were still in a period of semi-conflict and debate , this fear that if the royal navy had the power of right to search they would then just go and stop ships and interrupt their shipping and commerce , " deborah hodson , of portsmouth naval museum , said .
the navy changes from protector to suppressor " in reality the navy only ever stopped ships that they were allowed to stop through treaty , otherwise it would have been seen as an act of war - you could n't just go and stop another ship and demand to search them for slaves or slave traders but it was a point of diplomatic debate . "
the west africa squadron , initially just two ships , expanded its patrol of about 3,000 miles of the african coast to about 30 ships .
it had seized approximately 1,600 ships and freed the 150,000 africans aboard .
just 10 % of the estimated numbers involved in illegal trade .
lt cmdr lauste reminds that the royal navy now " do not routinely go out to seek down / prevent illegal smuggling of people " but they will always assist .
" -lsb- the navy is -rsb- rendering humanitarian aid to victims of smuggling , as and when we come across them , as they are victims , they are exploited , " he adds .
last summer , the navy 's flagship , portsmouth-based hms illustrious intercepted a dhow in the arabian sea .
" when we investigated it more closely it turned out there were 750 people which was a huge overload for a vessel that size , " captain bob cooling said from the aircraft carrier .
the crew of hms illustrious aided an over full dhow " it 's just not safe to have anything like that number of people on board i would say that 100 is the limit for that size of vessel - with 750 people it could capsize at anytime . "
two centuries after ch binstead 's diaries , lt cmdr ahmed ajala , who served on hms york , gives his own first-hand account of illegal human trafficking .
" east of the straights of gibraltar we had to pick bodies out of the sea - after they were travelling to a spanish island from africa .
" these people were suffering and traffickers had left them at sea .
" the navy will hand them over to the authorities , provide humanitarian aid and assistance . "

at the time the uk is marking the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which led to the abolition of the slave trade , the crew 's task involves updating maps of the coastline , some of which have not been updated since they were drawn up by ch binstead 's colleagues .

well the list includes , commonwealth , collaborative work , the threat from piracy , anti-drug work , contributions to countering illegal human trafficking , offshore oil installation security ... "
countering illegal human trafficking falls under the modern navy 's maritime security operations .

" hms illustrious and hms scott tendered assistance saving many hundreds of lives . "
' diplomatic debate ' the navy 's powers to stop and search were queried with the west africa squadron .
" in the early days there was this fear , particularly from the american navy because obviously we were still in a period of semi-conflict and debate , this fear that if the royal navy had the power of right to search they would then just go and stop ships and interrupt their shipping and commerce , " deborah hodson , of portsmouth naval museum , said .
the navy changes from protector to suppressor " in reality the navy only ever stopped ships that they were allowed to stop through treaty , otherwise it would have been seen as an act of war - you could n't just go and stop another ship and demand to search them for slaves or slave traders but it was a point of diplomatic debate . "
the west africa squadron , initially just two ships , expanded its patrol of about 3,000 miles of the african coast to about 30 ships .
it had seized approximately 1,600 ships and freed the 150,000 africans aboard .
just 10 % of the estimated numbers involved in illegal trade .
lt cmdr lauste reminds that the royal navy now " do not routinely go out to seek down / prevent illegal smuggling of people " but they will always assist .
" -lsb- the navy is -rsb- rendering humanitarian aid to victims of smuggling , as and when we come across them , as they are victims , they are exploited , " he adds .
last summer , the navy 's flagship , portsmouth-based hms illustrious intercepted a dhow in the arabian sea .
" when we investigated it more closely it turned out there were 750 people which was a huge overload for a vessel that size , " captain bob cooling said from the aircraft carrier .
the crew of hms illustrious aided an over full dhow " it 's just not safe to have anything like that number of people on board i would say that 100 is the limit for that size of vessel - with 750 people it could capsize at anytime . "
two centuries after ch binstead 's diaries , lt cmdr ahmed ajala , who served on hms york , gives his own first-hand account of illegal human trafficking .
" east of the straights of gibraltar we had to pick bodies out of the sea - after they were travelling to a spanish island from africa .
" these people were suffering and traffickers had left them at sea .
" the navy will hand them over to the authorities , provide humanitarian aid and assistance . "

back to 2007 , and hms enterprise is at sea off the west african coast .
at the time the uk is marking the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which led to the abolition of the slave trade , the crew 's task involves updating maps of the coastline , some of which have not been updated since they were drawn up by ch binstead 's colleagues .
in a blog , crew members recall why they are taking part in a research trip to that coastline : " some have asked " why west africa " ?

the navy changes from protector to suppressor " in reality the navy only ever stopped ships that they were allowed to stop through treaty , otherwise it would have been seen as an act of war - you could n't just go and stop another ship and demand to search them for slaves or slave traders but it was a point of diplomatic debate .

the west africa squadron , initially just two ships , expanded its patrol of about 3,000 miles of the african coast to about 30 ships .
it had seized approximately 1,600 ships and freed the 150,000 africans aboard .
just 10 % of the estimated numbers involved in illegal trade .

the operation was part of the national operation pentameter , which aims to tackle exploitation within the sex industry .
today the fight against sex trafficking continues as officers from the devon and cornwall force share information with other forces around the uk .
the uk human trafficking centre -lrb- ukhtc -rrb- in sheffield , europe 's first dedicated centre for victims of people-trafficking , was created in october last year .
it brings together a number of agencies including care organisations and the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- to tackle 21st century slavery , as the uk marks 200 years since the parliamentary act which to abolish the slave trade .
det insp martin warren of soca in devon and cornwall said that since the introduction of the ukhtc , work had been stepped up to identify and care for victims of human trafficking , which was now " commonplace " in the west country . "
victims are often reluctant to go to the authorities , fearing retribution " det insp martin warren he said : " it is a fact the criminal networks involved do not limit their activity into the country 's urban areas and the force recognises the need to take action within its own boundaries .
" the blatant exploitation of vulnerable people is totally contrary to normal social values in this country .
" people that get involved can expect some intervention by police at some stage . "
he admitted that although the police accepted the illegal trade in humanity was now common in the region , the force faced difficulties unearthing victims .
" victims are often reluctant to go to the authorities , fearing retribution from their captors against them or even their families in their country of origin , so you do have a situation where it is difficult to get to the bottom of cases . "
the poppy project in london is one of the care organisations that works with the ukhtc , and has provided safe accommodation for victims of sex trafficking from the west country .
nineteen-year-old medija , from albania , is one such victim and this is her story : " before i was trafficked , i lived in a small town in albania with my family .
i left school when i was 14 so i could work in the market with my father .
he was very worried all the time about money , and sometimes he would hit me .
while i was working i met a man called guri .
he said he had seen me around and liked me .
he became my boyfriend .
' disowned me ' my parents did not approve and said i must choose between him and them .
i decided to go and live with guri , as i was tired of living in a small house .
after a few months he said he wanted to take me to live in italy .
i did n't want to go but my family had disowned me so i had no choice .
i agreed to go .
guri paid for my travel and we travelled by speedboat to italy , where he gave me false italian travel documents .
he said i would need them because the uk authorities were prejudiced against albanians .
from italy we travelled across europe by coach to the uk , where we were met by a friend of guri 's .
he drove us to a house .
that 's when they told me that i would be working as a prostitute .
i screamed and cried and refused .
they beat me badly and raped me , and told me i had no choice .
it was true . "
i was exhausted and often in pain " medija i had sex with between five and ten men every day , seven days a week , working in saunas during the day and massage parlours some nights .
i was exhausted and often in pain , from all the men and from the beatings .
i had no contact with my family and i was locked in the house all the time , only let out to go to work .
i lived like this for six months until the police raided the sauna .
they took me to the poppy project , who gave me shelter and are helping me recover from my experiences .
i still have many problems .
i ca n't sleep and have nightmares , and sometimes i have panic attacks .
i am afraid of people and do not like to leave the house .
i do n't trust anybody .
i sometimes drink too much , to help me forget what happened .
but it does n't work .
i will never forget what those men did to me . "
heather sable of plymouth-based devon and cornwall refugee support council , said medija 's plight was " just the tip of the iceberg " of human suffering created by human trafficking in the region .
each week she and her volunteer workers tackle about 100 cases a week of refugees for whom a paid human trafficker was the only way to get out of their country of origin and into the uk .
provision of false passports and travel documents all came as part of the illicit trade in humans .
the result when refugees appear in the uk is often not what they expected .
' fine line ' refused asylum and relying partly on handouts , some fall prey to prostitution to make ends meet .
" i know at least two people that have got into prostitution out of destitution , " she said .
" there is a fine line between human trafficking and asylum seekers . "
following the raid in truro last year , two 28-year-old east european men were cautioned by police for sexual offences .
last december , 61-year-old philip mepham , of killivose road , camborne appeared at truro crown court and admitted managing or assisting the management of a brothel .
he was fined £ 2,000 and ordered to pay £ 500 costs .
the court heard that the two lithuanian women had been working at the brothel .
one had left the area and the other had returned to lithuania .

an estimated 4,000 trafficked women are thought to be working in the british sex trade at any one time , having arrived from across the world .
the majority willingly travel here from eastern europe , west africa and south-east asia with the promise of jobs , more money and a better way of life .
what they end up as are commodities .
coerced , often forced , to work as prostitutes , they are moved from address to address , city to city , by the gangs that control them .
they have little chance of escape , let alone the life they were promised , and live in constant fear of being " sold " on to another gang .
but according to those on the frontline trying to help these women , it is not a threat confined to foreign nationals - some believe it is a two way street .
in short : british women are being threatened with being sold abroad .
' logical step ' peter green is the project director of barnabus , a christian outreach which works with people involved in the sex trade in manchester , dubbed " the sauna capital of europe " .
although the charity finds it difficult to access the city 's massage parlours , volunteers have seen a sharp rise in the number of women from eastern europe working the streets in the last 12 months .
" i believe it -lrb- sex trafficking -rrb- is widespread , " mr green told the bbc .
" but i also believe we are not aware this is a two way issue , that young women are being taken out of our country and sold abroad because they owe money to the massage parlours . "
we are aware of internal trafficking , where foreign nationals are grooming english girls and taking them city to city grahame maxwell , acpo warning over uk child trafficking although he can not go into the specific details , mr green has been alerted to the threat hanging over one british woman by fellow charity workers - at a time when the uk is marking the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which brought about the abolition of the slave trade .
" it 's something i 'd never considered , but when i first heard about the plight of this young lassie it became a logic to me , " he said .
" if people are being transported one way they can be transported the other way .
" this young lassie was having to service 20 guys a day just to pay off interest , that 's before she started to earn anything , and she was under constant threat of being sent out - trafficked - out of the country . "
after raising the issue at a meeting of the stop the traffik organisation in manchester and discussing it with other church of england charities , mr green believes it is an issue that has not been previously considered .
" i do n't believe people see it , particularly the church , " he said .
" we just see what we see on the television and in the newspapers -lrb- about trafficking -rrb- and we are working from that without looking in the opposite direction . "
mr green has raised the issue with other charities figures about the influx of vulnerable women into this country , because of the covert nature of trafficking , are almost impossible to pin down accurately .
so when it comes to data supporting the concept of british women being forced out of the uk , the figures are non-existent - as yet .
the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- , believes the threat of being sold may well be a tool that gangs use to coerce women into sex work .
grahame maxwell , deputy chief of south yorkshire police and programme director at the new uk human trafficking centre in sheffield , told the bbc : " we are aware of internal trafficking , where foreign nationals are grooming english girls and taking them city to city .
" it is , however , very hard to get a person who does n't want to leave the country to leave .
" so unless they are drugged and hidden in the back of a van , which then you are talking something very serious indeed , a lot of it may well be just threats . "
mass exploitation but according to the national christian alliance on prostitution -lrb- ncap -rrb- , there is " an issue " of uk women being trafficked abroad .
spokesman mark wakeling told the bbc that mr green 's was " not an isolated story " .
" i have heard of it as well , from a group working in the west midlands , about young girls being groomed by men who try to get them to go overseas to ' visit people ' .
" who knows what happens when they get there ?
it could be viewed as a form of slavery , " he added .
but for christian groups like ncap and other charities that work with women involved in the sex trade , the issue of british women being groomed for sexual exploitation within the uk is just as pressing .
mr wakeling points to the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- definition of trafficking , which encompasses themes such as the abuse of power or a position of vulnerability as well as the recruitment and transfer of people .
" a lot of people think trafficking only happens when there is a change of country , " he said .
" actually , the vast majority of women on the streets are being exploited because of their vulnerability in the same way someone brought from lithuania to manchester is being exploited as well .
" you might not always have a physical enslavement -lrb- as a prostitute -rrb- in the uk but you certainly have a psychological enslavement . "

her story was harrowing .
having been trafficked to france and forced into prostitution by her aunt , she fled to britain with the help of a man who said he would help her escape .
suffering from a range of physical and mental health problems , probably as a result of the abuse she endured , marie was admitted to hospital .
within two months she was dead .
a post-mortem examination revealed natural causes .
she was 16 .
sadly , marie 's case is thought to be just the tip of the iceberg and part of a growing industry which contributes to the 5,000 child sex slaves recently estimated to be working in the uk by the joseph rowntree foundation .
this comes as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade .
according to ecpat uk , an organisation which represents charities working against child exploitation , marie 's was one of 28 known cases of trafficked children in manchester in 2005 .
sometimes with new forms of child abuse it takes people time to get their heads around it pauline newman , director of children 's services warning over uk child trafficking a subsequent serious case review at manchester city council revealed a " failure to connect things and see what was happening " among the agencies which dealt with marie , according to pauline newman , director of children 's services .
since then , the council has worked hard to change its practises to the extent it has become a leading authority in its work with children from abroad .
in addition to developing guidance on child trafficking , a new refugee and asylum team was set up within the children 's division , and regular strategy meetings are held with other agencies on suspected cases .
" sometimes with new forms of child abuse it takes people time to get their heads around it , " said mrs newman .
" what we have done as a result of that -lrb- serious case review -rrb- is plan all our future work based on what we learnt .
" i think the biggest problem for practitioners is that they need training to recognise what 's happening , because not all asylum seeking children are trafficked .
we need to train staff to recognise those who are .
" that 's about opening your eyes to how that might manifest itself and then being confident enough to take the appropriate action . "
children ' disappearing ' manchester 's child social workers are now specially trained in recognising signs of trafficking , but accurate figures for the scale of the issue in the city are almost impossible to come by because of its covert nature .
professionals can only help those children they are alerted to , but according to ecpat uk , one of the biggest concerns is the number of trafficked children who simply go missing .
mrs newman admits it is the major problem they face , and says trafficked children " disappear as fast as they appear " .
they are usually living under fear of threats or coercion - they 're not going to disclose that they have been trafficked christine beddoe assuming a confused , scared foreign-language child can find an agency to help them in the first place , a social worker eventually has to ask the question : " have you been trafficked ? "
" it is n't the easiest thing in the world to work up to say to somebody who , if they have been trafficked , will be extremely frightened and may well not trust agencies like ourselves ... and then they have been deceived and abused by adults in general , " said mrs newman .
" they enter the system and they can disappear of their own volition , or sometimes they can be taken back into the trafficking network by the people who are pushing back against the things we are doing , " she said .
" and for children who are unaccompanied asylum seeking children - which includes some who will have been trafficked - there is this tension between the law on asylum and immigration and the law on children . "
according to the charities who work with trafficked children it is this friction between these two laws that lead to children disappearing , only exacerbating the problem .
ecpat uk has criticised the latest home office consultation in early march , the home office released a consultation document outlining plans for better outcomes for unaccompanied asylum seeking children .
but far from helping professionals work with conflicting legislation , ecpat uk argues that its proposals will actually make the situation worse and drive more children underground .
" it will effectively undermine some of the protection work being done to protect victims of child trafficking , " project director christine beddoe told bbc news .
" although there are already significant problems in recognising the needs of victims , the policies coming out are putting children even further at risk , because they completely ignore their needs . "
ms beddoe says one of the most controversial aspects of the document is plans to base any child 's asylum application on their first interview with the authorities , at the time when they are most vulnerable and wary .
" we know that they do n't disclose immediately , " she said .
" they are usually living under fear of threats or coercion - they 're not going to disclose that they have been trafficked .
" for those who are more vulnerable - those who have been trafficked , abused or exploited - it leaves them more exposed to the criminal networks . "
safety fears for those on the frontline in manchester , all unaccompanied asylum seeking children are treated as any other child and are admitted to care if they are under 16 .
mrs newman says there is " no doubt the laws sit uneasily together " , but the council nevertheless has to work within them .
" they become a looked after child and they should be treated as one , but because they know and we know that they may have to leave the country when they are 18 , we have to have a ' twin track ' with them , " she said .
" a large issue for them is , ' well if i go underground , as i am getting older will i find myself able to stay ? ' .
" our job is to say : ' we can make you safe ' .
and that 's what we try to do . "

an estimated 4,000 trafficked women are thought to be working in the british sex trade at any one time , having arrived from across the world .
the majority willingly travel here from eastern europe , west africa and south-east asia with the promise of jobs , more money and a better way of life .
what they end up as are commodities .
coerced , often forced , to work as prostitutes , they are moved from address to address , city to city , by the gangs that control them .
they have little chance of escape , let alone the life they were promised , and live in constant fear of being " sold " on to another gang .
but according to those on the frontline trying to help these women , it is not a threat confined to foreign nationals - some believe it is a two way street .
in short : british women are being threatened with being sold abroad .
' logical step ' peter green is the project director of barnabus , a christian outreach which works with people involved in the sex trade in manchester , dubbed " the sauna capital of europe " .
although the charity finds it difficult to access the city 's massage parlours , volunteers have seen a sharp rise in the number of women from eastern europe working the streets in the last 12 months .
" i believe it -lrb- sex trafficking -rrb- is widespread , " mr green told the bbc .
" but i also believe we are not aware this is a two way issue , that young women are being taken out of our country and sold abroad because they owe money to the massage parlours . "
we are aware of internal trafficking , where foreign nationals are grooming english girls and taking them city to city grahame maxwell , acpo warning over uk child trafficking although he can not go into the specific details , mr green has been alerted to the threat hanging over one british woman by fellow charity workers - at a time when the uk is marking the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act which brought about the abolition of the slave trade .
" it 's something i 'd never considered , but when i first heard about the plight of this young lassie it became a logic to me , " he said .
" if people are being transported one way they can be transported the other way .

mr wakeling points to the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- definition of trafficking , which encompasses themes such as the abuse of power or a position of vulnerability as well as the recruitment and transfer of people .
" a lot of people think trafficking only happens when there is a change of country , " he said .

an estimated 4,000 trafficked women are thought to be working in the british sex trade at any one time , having arrived from across the world .
the majority willingly travel here from eastern europe , west africa and south-east asia with the promise of jobs , more money and a better way of life .
what they end up as are commodities .
coerced , often forced , to work as prostitutes , they are moved from address to address , city to city , by the gangs that control them .
they have little chance of escape , let alone the life they were promised , and live in constant fear of being " sold " on to another gang .
but according to those on the frontline trying to help these women , it is not a threat confined to foreign nationals - some believe it is a two way street .
in short : british women are being threatened with being sold abroad .

although the charity finds it difficult to access the city 's massage parlours , volunteers have seen a sharp rise in the number of women from eastern europe working the streets in the last 12 months .
" i believe it -lrb- sex trafficking -rrb- is widespread , " mr green told the bbc .

mr green has raised the issue with other charities figures about the influx of vulnerable women into this country , because of the covert nature of trafficking , are almost impossible to pin down accurately .

the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- , believes the threat of being sold may well be a tool that gangs use to coerce women into sex work .

the raid was part of operation pentameter , the first co-ordinated effort to tackle human trafficking on a national scale .
officers found evidence of links to brothels in other counties and brought three women away from the address .
police captured the brothel keeper , ben lin , 37 , six weeks later .
lin was sentenced to 30 months in jail and recommended to be deported on completion of his sentence . "
if you can get trafficking in places like cheltenham and leamington spa you can get it anywhere " dr timothy brain brothel keeper gets 30-months operation pentameter , which was launched by dr timothy brain - chief constable of gloucestershire police - on behalf of the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- , was judged a success for the force .
dr brain has been the acpo spokesperson on prostitution and related vice matters for more than 10 years .
during his time in that role he has noticed a growth in trafficking women and in some cases minors for sexual exploitation .
" it has been a growing phenomenon and pentameter was an opportunity to say ' unless we make a stand now this will become a very big problem for the future ' , " said dr brain .
' ultimate crime ' " we needed to make it clear that the uk not only does not support that kind of activity on principle but will also do something about it in practice . "
prior to pentameter 's launch dr brain had learned that many forces were indicating through their intelligence that trafficking had ended up in their areas .
" we here in cheltenham had a case and up the road there was another one in leamington spa .
my observation to put it simply is if you can get trafficking in places like cheltenham and leamington spa you can get it anywhere , " said dr brain , speaking as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade .
" that 's the reality of this so-called trade we 're now engaged in .
" it 's something that can start thousands of miles away and end up on a street near you .
it is the ultimate international local crime . "
identifying trends as in the cheltenham case , the majority of trafficked women enter the uk illegally but not through packing crates or packaging , more usually it is by using some form of deception to get through immigration controls .
" the women pay for that to happen and the gang masters get paid and then literally sell the women on , sometimes at the airport , to someone who 'll take them on and run them as prostitutes .
" and then they can get sold on again and again - and that quite simply is slavery , " said dr timothy brain .
work carried out in the aftermath of the first stage of pentameter supports the suggestion women come to the uk for illegal labour but find themselves in sexual exploitation .
pentameter 's legacy one of the benefits of a national approach to the problem of modern day slavery has been a sharing of information between forces .
" we 've created a system where that can easily happen - we had a national intelligence cell in london which has turned into something permanent and that 's one of the functions of the uk centre for human trafficking in sheffield , " said dr brain .
" after pentameter there is now a permanent body to nationally co-ordinate information and to collate and disseminate specialised intelligence in this field . "
the work of operation pentameter continues as detectives try to cut off the traffickers ' finances .
" the bulk of the profits are in the computer-based offshore accounts that lie behind these illegal criminal activities , " said dr brain .
" because they 're offshore that presents a big problem for us but equally the same kind of computer financing that makes offshore accounting possible makes it possible for us to trace the assets too .
" that 's being handled locally - gloucestershire police are chasing money banked in china , " he said .
the legacy of pentameter is a tried and tested process in place ready for operation pentameter ii - again led by dr timothy brain .

dean sim , a mother of two , came to the uk after paying £ 15,000 to a fixer in malaysia who promised her a legitimate job in the uk .
on arrival in london she was dumped with no money , housing or job and found herself living on the streets .
in china town a " friendly " woman told her about a cleaning job in cheltenham .
as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , thousands of people are still being brought into the country , ultimately to work as slaves .
left alone like many of the women who are trafficked into the uk , dean sim thought she would be able to quickly pay back the fixer and begin sending money home to support her family .
" i have a son and a daughter who live with my mother in malaysia and they need the money , " she told gloucestershire police .
in october 2006 dean sim was chaperoned on the flight to heathrow by the man who had helped broker the deal for her at home .
she told police she was nervous but happy about her new prospects .
but , after negotiating immigration with her , the man took her to a hotel in london , stole her fake passport and left her alone .
" i was very scared - i had nothing - i could not contact home , " she said .
after being thrown out of the hotel for not paying her bill dean sim made her way to china town where she was told about the cheltenham cleaning job .
' i was desperate ' with nowhere to sleep , no english and no money she had little choice but to ring the number .
the house in dunalley street she was taken to was already under surveillance by officers working for operation pentameter .
the initiative was set up to smash the illegal exploitation of people who are brought to the uk and kept as virtual prisoners in brothels .
" when i arrived -lrb- in cheltenham by train -rrb- i was met by the boss who brought me and a chinese girl to the house where i met two girls from hong kong and a receptionist , " she told detectives .

dean sim , a mother of two , came to the uk after paying £ 15,000 to a fixer in malaysia who promised her a legitimate job in the uk .
on arrival in london she was dumped with no money , housing or job and found herself living on the streets .
in china town a " friendly " woman told her about a cleaning job in cheltenham .
as the uk marks the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary act to abolish the slave trade , thousands of people are still being brought into the country , ultimately to work as slaves .
left alone like many of the women who are trafficked into the uk , dean sim thought she would be able to quickly pay back the fixer and begin sending money home to support her family .
" i have a son and a daughter who live with my mother in malaysia and they need the money , " she told gloucestershire police .
in october 2006 dean sim was chaperoned on the flight to heathrow by the man who had helped broker the deal for her at home .
she told police she was nervous but happy about her new prospects .
but , after negotiating immigration with her , the man took her to a hotel in london , stole her fake passport and left her alone .
" i was very scared - i had nothing - i could not contact home , " she said .
after being thrown out of the hotel for not paying her bill dean sim made her way to china town where she was told about the cheltenham cleaning job .
' i was desperate ' with nowhere to sleep , no english and no money she had little choice but to ring the number .
the house in dunalley street she was taken to was already under surveillance by officers working for operation pentameter .
the initiative was set up to smash the illegal exploitation of people who are brought to the uk and kept as virtual prisoners in brothels .
" when i arrived -lrb- in cheltenham by train -rrb- i was met by the boss who brought me and a chinese girl to the house where i met two girls from hong kong and a receptionist , " she told detectives .
