22 .
it says that " this novelty brings an element of incentive and remuneration into the vatican salary system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after saturday , there will be 201 cardinals in the vatican the newcomers will bring the total number of cardinals to 201 , of whom 120 are young enough - under 80 - to take part in a papal election .
the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.11.2007 opinion : learning from high gas prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as oil moved in this week on the $ 100 a barrel mark , dw 's rolf wenkel suggests we take the opportunity to wean ourselves off our oil dependency . in terms of economic theory , the oil market is an exemplary one .
prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .

the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 22.11.2007 german research could benefit from stem-cell breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over " pluripotent " stem cells , like this one , took a new turn scientists have said a major breakthrough this week in stem-cell research could have an impact on the ongoing debate over embryonic stem-cell use in germany , where restrictions are particularly tight . teams of us and japanese researchers said on tuesday , nov .
20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 22.11.2007 german research could benefit from stem-cell breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over " pluripotent " stem cells , like this one , took a new turn scientists have said a major breakthrough this week in stem-cell research could have an impact on the ongoing debate over embryonic stem-cell use in germany , where restrictions are particularly tight . teams of us and japanese researchers said on tuesday , nov .
20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .

scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .

" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 22.11.2007 german research could benefit from stem-cell breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over " pluripotent " stem cells , like this one , took a new turn scientists have said a major breakthrough this week in stem-cell research could have an impact on the ongoing debate over embryonic stem-cell use in germany , where restrictions are particularly tight . teams of us and japanese researchers said on tuesday , nov .
20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.11.2007 merkel 's government shows the strain at halfway mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's parting gift to müntefering was a soccer in the coalition colors nov .
22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .

coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a wait-and-see approach is not an option , " britain , france and germany told governors of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on thursday , nov .
22 . the statement came in response to the latest reports on iran 's nuclear program at the iaea 's end of year meeting in vienna .
at the meeting , iaea director general mohamed elbaradei said the agency was still unable to confirm that iran 's nuclear drive is entirely peaceful , despite increased cooperation from the iranian government in key areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei the iaea " has so far not been able to verify some important aspects of iran 's nuclear program , " elbaradei said . the statement by the " eu-3 " said this was " unacceptable . " " we are interested at least as much in the present and future -lsb- of iran 's program -rsb- as the past , " it said . suspician traces of uranium the iaea wants credible explanations for traces of highly enriched - or bomb-grade - uranium that inspectors found at research sites , and intelligence on links between uranium processing , explosives tests and a missile warhead design . the eu and the united states fear iran is secretly trying to build atom bombs , and are pushing for the un security council to impose further sanction on iran , which claims it only wants electricity from uranium enrichment . ali asghar soltanieh , iran 's envoy to the iaea , told reporters the agency 's report showed the iranian goverment of mahmoud ahmadinejad had been truthful about its nuclear course and warned against further sanctions . " we will continue the mood of cooperation provided that ... peace-loving countries prevent the united states or others from making noise and creating problems and jeopardizing this constructive approach by any measure in the un security council , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea inspectors have only had limited access in iran " we recognize iran has taken some steps in the right direction but we are disappointed that cooperation is of a partial and reactive nature , " the eu-3 said .
" so , all in all , the results are not encouraging . " for his part , iran ambassador soltanieh warned that any talk of possible sanctions would be counterproductive . both russia and china , two of the un security council 's five permanent members , have blocked previous calls for tougher sections , saying they were counterproductive . current sanctions , imposed in march 2007 and december 2006 , ban the supply of nuclear-related technology and materials , block iranian arms exports , and freeze the assets of individuals and companies involved in iran 's nuclear and missile programs . iran to meet with eu iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said on thursday he would meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana next friday . jalili said he was optimistic about the upcoming talks but indicated there was no chance of iran giving in on the question of enrichment - the key demand of the european union and the un security council . " i am optimistic about the negotiations with solana .
we have a positive view about negotiations and while respecting our duties we say that pressure will not make us renounce our rights , " said jalili . bildunterschrift : the security council expanded sanctions in march solana said on thursday creating international nuclear fuel production sites under multinational supervision could ease the standoff .
" only a multilateral solution can make it possible to end this crisis , " he told a conference on european policy . solana must report the outcome of his efforts to the un security council on nov .

22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says that " this novelty brings an element of incentive and remuneration into the vatican salary system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .

the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .

thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says that " this novelty brings an element of incentive and remuneration into the vatican salary system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .

the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .

economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.11.2007 merkel 's government shows the strain at halfway mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's parting gift to müntefering was a soccer in the coalition colors nov .
22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .

" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .

" basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .

22 .
it says that " this novelty brings an element of incentive and remuneration into the vatican salary system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after saturday , there will be 201 cardinals in the vatican the newcomers will bring the total number of cardinals to 201 , of whom 120 are young enough - under 80 - to take part in a papal election .
the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .

although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp .

strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .

22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

22 .
it says that " this novelty brings an element of incentive and remuneration into the vatican salary system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after saturday , there will be 201 cardinals in the vatican the newcomers will bring the total number of cardinals to 201 , of whom 120 are young enough - under 80 - to take part in a papal election .
the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .
" no idea , " müntefering responded . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 22.11.2007 german research could benefit from stem-cell breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over " pluripotent " stem cells , like this one , took a new turn scientists have said a major breakthrough this week in stem-cell research could have an impact on the ongoing debate over embryonic stem-cell use in germany , where restrictions are particularly tight . teams of us and japanese researchers said on tuesday , nov .
20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
it says that " this novelty brings an element of incentive and remuneration into the vatican salary system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after saturday , there will be 201 cardinals in the vatican the newcomers will bring the total number of cardinals to 201 , of whom 120 are young enough - under 80 - to take part in a papal election .
the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 22.11.2007 german research could benefit from stem-cell breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over " pluripotent " stem cells , like this one , took a new turn scientists have said a major breakthrough this week in stem-cell research could have an impact on the ongoing debate over embryonic stem-cell use in germany , where restrictions are particularly tight . teams of us and japanese researchers said on tuesday , nov .
20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .

20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .
" one has to keep in mind that these cells are treated with viruses .
they have an excess of foreign protein , and they also may mix up the control studies to some extent … it needs to be studied in more detail , " faissner said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.11.2007 merkel 's government shows the strain at halfway mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's parting gift to müntefering was a soccer in the coalition colors nov .
22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .

" a wait-and-see approach is not an option , " britain , france and germany told governors of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on thursday , nov .
22 . the statement came in response to the latest reports on iran 's nuclear program at the iaea 's end of year meeting in vienna .
at the meeting , iaea director general mohamed elbaradei said the agency was still unable to confirm that iran 's nuclear drive is entirely peaceful , despite increased cooperation from the iranian government in key areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei the iaea " has so far not been able to verify some important aspects of iran 's nuclear program , " elbaradei said . the statement by the " eu-3 " said this was " unacceptable .

" we will continue the mood of cooperation provided that ... peace-loving countries prevent the united states or others from making noise and creating problems and jeopardizing this constructive approach by any measure in the un security council , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea inspectors have only had limited access in iran " we recognize iran has taken some steps in the right direction but we are disappointed that cooperation is of a partial and reactive nature , " the eu-3 said .

" for his part , iran ambassador soltanieh warned that any talk of possible sanctions would be counterproductive . both russia and china , two of the un security council 's five permanent members , have blocked previous calls for tougher sections , saying they were counterproductive . current sanctions , imposed in march 2007 and december 2006 , ban the supply of nuclear-related technology and materials , block iranian arms exports , and freeze the assets of individuals and companies involved in iran 's nuclear and missile programs . iran to meet with eu iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said on thursday he would meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana next friday . jalili said he was optimistic about the upcoming talks but indicated there was no chance of iran giving in on the question of enrichment - the key demand of the european union and the un security council . " i am optimistic about the negotiations with solana .
we have a positive view about negotiations and while respecting our duties we say that pressure will not make us renounce our rights , " said jalili . bildunterschrift : the security council expanded sanctions in march solana said on thursday creating international nuclear fuel production sites under multinational supervision could ease the standoff .
" only a multilateral solution can make it possible to end this crisis , " he told a conference on european policy . solana must report the outcome of his efforts to the un security council on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.11.2007 opinion : learning from high gas prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as oil moved in this week on the $ 100 a barrel mark , dw 's rolf wenkel suggests we take the opportunity to wean ourselves off our oil dependency . in terms of economic theory , the oil market is an exemplary one .
prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.11.2007 opinion : learning from high gas prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as oil moved in this week on the $ 100 a barrel mark , dw 's rolf wenkel suggests we take the opportunity to wean ourselves off our oil dependency . in terms of economic theory , the oil market is an exemplary one .
prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

at the meeting , iaea director general mohamed elbaradei said the agency was still unable to confirm that iran 's nuclear drive is entirely peaceful , despite increased cooperation from the iranian government in key areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei the iaea " has so far not been able to verify some important aspects of iran 's nuclear program , " elbaradei said . the statement by the " eu-3 " said this was " unacceptable . " " we are interested at least as much in the present and future -lsb- of iran 's program -rsb- as the past , " it said . suspician traces of uranium the iaea wants credible explanations for traces of highly enriched - or bomb-grade - uranium that inspectors found at research sites , and intelligence on links between uranium processing , explosives tests and a missile warhead design . the eu and the united states fear iran is secretly trying to build atom bombs , and are pushing for the un security council to impose further sanction on iran , which claims it only wants electricity from uranium enrichment . ali asghar soltanieh , iran 's envoy to the iaea , told reporters the agency 's report showed the iranian goverment of mahmoud ahmadinejad had been truthful about its nuclear course and warned against further sanctions . " we will continue the mood of cooperation provided that ... peace-loving countries prevent the united states or others from making noise and creating problems and jeopardizing this constructive approach by any measure in the un security council , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea inspectors have only had limited access in iran " we recognize iran has taken some steps in the right direction but we are disappointed that cooperation is of a partial and reactive nature , " the eu-3 said .
" so , all in all , the results are not encouraging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 22.11.2007 german research could benefit from stem-cell breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over " pluripotent " stem cells , like this one , took a new turn scientists have said a major breakthrough this week in stem-cell research could have an impact on the ongoing debate over embryonic stem-cell use in germany , where restrictions are particularly tight . teams of us and japanese researchers said on tuesday , nov .
20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "
call to continue research on embryo cells despite all the positives , scientists are warning that the new development does n't suddenly make research on embryonic stem cells obsolete . # b # " this new research is just the beginning - we hardly understand how these cells work , " said james thomson of the university of wisconsin at madison , who led one of the two teams which made the simultaneous discoveries .
" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "

" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "

" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "

transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "

" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .

20 , that they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells , a development that some say could alleviate ethical concerns about research in the field .
" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .

amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .

" the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .

22 .
it says that " this novelty brings an element of incentive and remuneration into the vatican salary system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is the smallest state in the world the decision was made yesterday morning at a meeting presided over by the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone , who in just over a year , has revolutionized the structure of the vatican .
currently , the salary of those in service at the vatican go from around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at level one to 2,300 at level 10 -lrb- to which are added payments for health insurance and superannuation -rrb- . new cardinals for vatican meanwhile , the vatican has also set to inaugurate 23 new roman catholic prelates who are set to join the vatican 's college of cardinals , the elite body that advises the pontiff and elects his successor upon his death , at the weekend .
pope benedict xvi will consecrate the new cardinals in saint peter 's square on saturday and confer on them the traditional ring and bright red hat symbolizing the blood of the martyrs during a mass on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after saturday , there will be 201 cardinals in the vatican the newcomers will bring the total number of cardinals to 201 , of whom 120 are young enough - under 80 - to take part in a papal election .
the new influx barely alters the geographical balance of the college of cardinals , which is heavily weighted in favor of europe .
forty-two of the total are italian , half of them under 80 .
thirteen europeans join two north americans , four latin americans , two africans and two asians in the second group of cardinals nominated by benedict since he was elected pope in april 2005 .
fifteen were inducted in march 2006 .
europe accounts for an increasingly shrinking percentage of the overall catholic population , while nearly half of the world 's catholics are in latin america , which combined with africa and asia make up some two-thirds of the 1.1 billion-strong church . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

prices are determined by supply and demand .
china fuels its growth with oil , the us fuels its cars , and the central heating season has just got started in the northern hemisphere , also fuelled with oil . but it 's looking less lively on the supply side , due to various geo-political turmoil , american and iranian saber-rattling , as well as technical difficulties in increasing the capacity of refineries .
with opec inflexible about raising production quotas , only saudi arabia is in a position briefly to increase daily quotas - but is repeatedly thwarted by the other member states at opec conferences .
and that 's not forgetting the speculators who have been pushing up prices in recent weeks .
it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy : the prices rise because everyone expects them to - and the gamblers on the futures market react accordingly .
thanks to the property crisis , bank shares have lost their appeal for hedge funds , while the money keeps pouring into oil contracts . in short : high demand and short supply mean rising prices .
economics can be that simple .
what 's more complex is the question as to how this oil price shock affects the world economy .
perhaps not as much as many fear , especially in europe .
that 's largely because the dollar is doing so much worse than the euro , which means the europeans are not feeling the pinch of oil costs quite so acutely .
in the us , meanwhile , the financial crisis and falling consumer confidence might well spell a recession .
here in europe , we 're less affected by prices at the pump for other reasons .
we 've learnt how to deal with rocketing oil costs , and the chemical industry , metal working and energy-intensive industries have all rapidly boosted their energy efficiency .
we require only half the energy we needed 20 years ago for the same amount of growth .
moreover , we are seeing growth in the banking sector , information technology and service industries - all areas which depend on relatively little oil .
globally , oil has become a less crucial production factor than it was two decades ago , which is why life would no longer need to come to a grinding halt were a barrel to cost $ 150 .
ultimately , this is not so much a crisis as an opportunity .
the higher the cost of oil , the more interesting the alternatives - including those previously dismissed as economically non-viable because they were always measured against the relatively low cost of oil .
today , scientists are fleshing out scenarios for the post-oil era , researching renewable sources such as the sun , water , wind , geothermal and biomass energy . we have long since realized that our finite energy sources are too valuable to use them to heat our badly-insulated homes , to drive the car to the mailbox or to criss-cross the planet on cheap flights .
every time the price skyrockets , the effect is therapeutic .
it forces industry to be economical on its use of energy ; it forces consumers to look into saving heating costs and driving less gas-guzzling cars - and it forces energy providers to invest in alternative energy sources .
the more expensive oil becomes , the more worthwhile it is to pin our hopes on investments that reduce our dependency on oil .
if you look at it like this , then let those prices climb - the higher the better .

" a wait-and-see approach is not an option , " britain , france and germany told governors of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on thursday , nov .
22 . the statement came in response to the latest reports on iran 's nuclear program at the iaea 's end of year meeting in vienna .
at the meeting , iaea director general mohamed elbaradei said the agency was still unable to confirm that iran 's nuclear drive is entirely peaceful , despite increased cooperation from the iranian government in key areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei the iaea " has so far not been able to verify some important aspects of iran 's nuclear program , " elbaradei said . the statement by the " eu-3 " said this was " unacceptable . " " we are interested at least as much in the present and future -lsb- of iran 's program -rsb- as the past , " it said . suspician traces of uranium the iaea wants credible explanations for traces of highly enriched - or bomb-grade - uranium that inspectors found at research sites , and intelligence on links between uranium processing , explosives tests and a missile warhead design . the eu and the united states fear iran is secretly trying to build atom bombs , and are pushing for the un security council to impose further sanction on iran , which claims it only wants electricity from uranium enrichment . ali asghar soltanieh , iran 's envoy to the iaea , told reporters the agency 's report showed the iranian goverment of mahmoud ahmadinejad had been truthful about its nuclear course and warned against further sanctions . " we will continue the mood of cooperation provided that ... peace-loving countries prevent the united states or others from making noise and creating problems and jeopardizing this constructive approach by any measure in the un security council , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea inspectors have only had limited access in iran " we recognize iran has taken some steps in the right direction but we are disappointed that cooperation is of a partial and reactive nature , " the eu-3 said .
" so , all in all , the results are not encouraging . " for his part , iran ambassador soltanieh warned that any talk of possible sanctions would be counterproductive . both russia and china , two of the un security council 's five permanent members , have blocked previous calls for tougher sections , saying they were counterproductive . current sanctions , imposed in march 2007 and december 2006 , ban the supply of nuclear-related technology and materials , block iranian arms exports , and freeze the assets of individuals and companies involved in iran 's nuclear and missile programs . iran to meet with eu iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said on thursday he would meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana next friday . jalili said he was optimistic about the upcoming talks but indicated there was no chance of iran giving in on the question of enrichment - the key demand of the european union and the un security council . " i am optimistic about the negotiations with solana .
we have a positive view about negotiations and while respecting our duties we say that pressure will not make us renounce our rights , " said jalili . bildunterschrift : the security council expanded sanctions in march solana said on thursday creating international nuclear fuel production sites under multinational supervision could ease the standoff .

" the induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " james thomson , a professor at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health who first isolated stem cells from embryos , told dpa news service .
" it 's going to completely change the field . "
a japanese team led by shinya yamanaka of kyoto university and the gladstone institute of cardiovascular disease , and the us team of researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison led by thomson and junying yu , separately inserted genes into cells derived from skin to create cells that share features with those from human embryos .
embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell and are considered to have strong potential in finding cures for diseases .
but because they had only been gleaned by destroying human embryos , their use in research has raised ethical concerns .
opponents say it is equivalent to taking a human life .
develop likely to impact research in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell research without embryos impacts the ethics debate this week 's development is likely to affect the medical- and biotech-research landscape in germany .
currently , the country has one of the most restrictive laws on stem-cell production and research in the world .
scientists are not allowed to use human stem cells that were imported to germany after jan .
1 , 2002 , which forces them to use limited , lower-quality cell lines for their research .
" if you can get stem cells without going to the embryo , then it may be easier to get support and funding for the research , " said andreas faissner , chair of the department of cell morphology and molecular neurobiology at the ruhr university in bochum in western germany .
" the political aspect of research funding is not to be ignored .
" the ethical debate influences funding politics , " continued faissner .
" this is true for germany and the us … and there is certain pressure in the european community .
all these aspects of scientific research and the business behind it will be affected by these findings . "
the bochum researcher added that he strongly favors moving the 2002 exclusion deadline set for stem-cell lines to a more recent date .
german scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use more recent embryos .
if they do , they run the risk of being criminally charged at home .
the regulations have effectively kept germany behind the curve when it comes to stem-cell research .
they have also led some of the country 's top scientists to move abroad in order to pursue their research in less restrictive environments .
reprogrammed skin cells have variety of applications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors can be prosecuted at home for using young stem cells in projects abroad faissner acknowledged that this week 's breakthrough is " quite spectacular , " adding that it is " particularly promising when it comes to tissue transplants . "
transplanted organ tissue reproduced using embryonic stem cells can be easily rejected , he explained , but the body is unlikely to reject cells made from its own skin .
in addition to transplants , the breakthrough methodology could find a host of other medical applications , including pharmaceutical testing and advances in the fight against degenerative diseases .
as a result , biotech companies that do work on skin cells " may experience a boost , " faissner said .
the reprogrammed skin cells could be used to study genetic degenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- als -rrb- , also known as lou gehrig 's disease .
" it is already possible to use genetic stem cells to generate motor neurons , to see how they develop , and what the differences are to so-called healthy neurons .
this -lsb- new type of stem cell -rsb- would be another way to investigate that disease . "

" it is not the time to abandon stem-cell research , " thomson said , adding that embryonic stem cells will remain the " gold standard by which other research is measured . "
faissner agreed .
" there may be those who argue that the stem-cell debate is n't needed anymore , but i think this is totally wrong , " he said .
" we need the use of embryonic stem cells to figure out these pathways - how a cell goes from an undifferentiated one to a hair or skin cell , or whatever - even if it will not lead to applications in a direct sense . "
moreover , he said , scientists do not yet know if embryonic cells or reprogrammed cells are comparable in every respect .
and because the scientists used retroviruses to introduce the genes into the skin cells that enabled them to turn into stem cells , the resulting cells are susceptible to developing cancerous tumors .
new method raises safety questions everyone involved has said the teams ' reprogramming techniques will have to be modified to be used safely for treatments .

22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .
amid simmering tensions in berlin , freshly minted vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier wants greater unity within the coalition . when social democrat franz müntefering resigned as vice chancellor last week in order to look after his cancer-stricken wife , the cracks in berlin 's balance of power became more visible than ever . as the grand coalition 's unofficial arbitrator , his departure dealt a serious blow to the government .
coming exactly two years into term , the move is likely to usher in a second half marked by widespread disharmony between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic partners . but müntefering 's successor , who is also germany 's foreign minister , is keen to play down the differences . " the government can not afford to be locked in a permanent election battle in the two years until the next vote , " said steinmeier on public broadcaster zdf , the same day he was officially appointed to fill the shoes of franz müntefering as vice chancellor . he would be aiming to make the coalition " more unified , " he added . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with repercussions disagreement is rife on a range of issues , from foreign policy to a minimum wage and tougher security laws , and steinmeier is expected to be a more critical force than müntefering .
in recent weeks , he has indicated disapproval of merkel 's foreign policy , especially in relations with russia and china - intimating that he regretted the effect merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama in berlin in late september has had on relations with beijing , such as a series of cancelled bilateral talks .
" as chancellor , i decide myself whom i receive and where , " merkel retaliated in the mass circulation newspaper bild .
" i would like everyone in the government to take this position , because otherwise china 's respect for us certainly will not become greater . " speaking on zdf wednesday , nov .
21 , steinmeier was keen to mitigate his earlier approach . " basically , the issues we disagree on at the moment can be boiled down to a question of striking the right tone when it comes to human rights , " he explained public support , party tension public opinion on the chancellor has been transformed since merkel assumed office in 2005 after an inconclusive election .
although she was initially given a lukewarm reception , polls now show she is germany 's most popular politician . under her leadership , the country experienced an economic upswing , with unemployment down and the budget deficit reduced .
on the international stage , she has championed environmental awareness and revived berlin 's friendship with washington . but within her coalition she has failed to flesh out a common agenda with the social democrats .
and while müntefering was able to tide the partners over , their differences can no longer be ignored . these are acute , according to guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition fdp . " they 're all lovey-dovey for the cameras , but as soon as they 're away from the flashbulbs they 're banging their heads together , " he said on private broadcaster n24 wednesday night . change inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting their heads together with the government reshuffled to adapt to the absence of müntefering , the next two years will most certainly see berlin undergo a major identity change . adding to the edgy atmosphere are suggestions that merkel is unlikely to warm to steinmeier as vice chancellor because he has been tipped as a potential candidate for the chancellorship at a later date .
strained relations will be tricky , given that his role requires him to coordinate government policy with merkel . but although the specter of early elections has already been raised , most experts agree that neither partner will risk bringing down the coalition before 2009 , when germany 's next election is due .
" anyone who chooses early elections will be punished by voters , " the cdu 's parliamentary leader volker kauder has said . asked on wednesday what he thought the coalition could do to stabilize itself , the former vice chancellor was visibly relieved to pass the buck .

the government has insisted the security breach followed a junior member of staff breaking the rules .
the loss of the hm revenue and customs computer discs may have put members of the public at risk of identity fraud .
the treasury said aspects of the conservatives ' account of events were factually inaccurate .
it is understood that one worker , a 23-year-old man , has resigned over the disappearance of the two data cds .
see sequence of events in the lost cds scandal the conservative head of the public accounts committee , edward leigh , claims senior revenue and customs officials approved the release of detailed information to the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- .
he said the nao wanted only limited child benefit records but was told in an e-mail from a senior business manager in march that to remove more sensitive information was too costly and complex .
that e-mail was apparently copied to an assistant director of the department .
have your say " how can we trust our government with access to electronic data on such a wide scale ? "
laura , oakworth send us your comments the result was that full details were sent to the audit office at that time , and again in october when they were lost in internal post .
the treasury has challenged aspects of the account but refuses to elaborate .
' systemic failure ' shadow chancellor george osborne said prime minister gordon brown 's account of what happened had been undermined .
" this was systemic failure , not individual error by a junior official , " he said .
missing data includes national insurance number name , address and birth date partner 's details names , sex and age of children bank / savings account details " gordon brown needs to tell us the whole truth of why the security of all families in the country has been put at risk . "
during a heated prime minister 's questions session , mr brown told mps : " i profoundly regret and apologise for the inconvenience and worries that have been caused to millions of families who receive child benefits .
" when mistakes happen in enforcing procedures , we have a duty to do everything we can to protect the public . "
he said he had ordered a review by the cabinet secretary of data safety in government and would give information commissioner richard thomas the power to spot check departments to ensure data was safe .
conservative leader david cameron said people would " be angry that the government has failed in its first duty to protect the public " .
mr cameron said people were " desperately worried " and they would " find it frankly weird " that mr brown still wanted to go ahead with plans for a national id cards scheme and register .
two labour backbench mps - karen buck and andy love - said the government should " pause " and " stand back " from the planned project .

after the mine closed in 1973 , the headgear and other components were stored at a privately-owned site at bwlchgwyn .
in september 1934 , 266 men died when an explosion ripped through the mine .
as well as the headgear , the museum has also acquired a pair of sheaves , which held the wheel in place .

bbc scotland revealed in august that airport managers were exploring the possibility of introducing direct flights from aberdeen to poland .
both the airport and baa continue to have discussions with airlines and potential providers of such a service .

" it is important for poles living in the north east to express their opinion about the potential for direct flights to poland , and to make it clear that there is a high demand for such a service .
" i believe that direct flight will be popular not only for people who live here in the north east of scotland but also for their friends and family members back in poland who would like to visit scotland for their holidays . "
mr glowacki said that an increase in flights from baa edinburgh and glasgow to poland showed such a direct service would also appeal in aberdeen .
he added : " the increase in cheap flights to poland proves that cities like krakow , warsaw and wroclaw are very popular destinations for short weekend trips for scots as well . "

" it is important for poles living in the north east to express their opinion about the potential for direct flights to poland , and to make it clear that there is a high demand for such a service .
" i believe that direct flight will be popular not only for people who live here in the north east of scotland but also for their friends and family members back in poland who would like to visit scotland for their holidays . "
mr glowacki said that an increase in flights from baa edinburgh and glasgow to poland showed such a direct service would also appeal in aberdeen .
he added : " the increase in cheap flights to poland proves that cities like krakow , warsaw and wroclaw are very popular destinations for short weekend trips for scots as well . "

their 1969 ex-military land rover ambulance will then be donated to a health clinic in africa .
one of the drivers , guto roberts , said it was going to be " one heck of an adventure " .
they will set off on 19 december with a convoy of about 20 vehicles taking part in the plymouth banjul rally to raise money for health care in gambia .
mr roberts , huw owen and david griffiths , who are all 27 and from anglesey , will sleep in the back of the ambulance en-route and hope to arrive in gambia after three weeks on the road .
mr roberts described the vehicle as " very sturdy , very slow and very thirsty " . "
we 've been warned that we need guides if we are to avoid mine fields in the sahara " guto roberts the men are working with cyfeillion sankwia friends , a charity based in amlwch which supports education and health initiatives in gambia .
they will also be raising money for tyddyn mon - a farm on anglesey which employs people with disabilities - and ysgol y bont special school at llangefni .
" in the back of the vehicle , which has a long wheel base , there are four stretchers which will be ideal for the clinic in sankwia , " said mr roberts .
" we 'll sleep in the back on the way because it makes things easier and means we have to pack less stuff , and on rest days we can just nip in the back for a nap before getting back to driving . "
' desert guides ' the journey will take them through europe to morocco , mauretania , senegal and then gambia , crossing the sahara desert .
" we 'll spend christmas in marrakesh in morocco , then the new year in the middle of the sahara somewhere . "
none of them has taken part in such a challenge before although mr griffith 's day job as a tractor mechanic might come in useful .
they are hoping that by joining up with the plymouth banjul rally they will get support and be able to employ guides to take them across the desert .
" we 've been warned that we need guides if we are to avoid mine fields in the sahara , " mr roberts added .

ford has said it plans to sell uk-based jaguar and land rover , which has plants across the west midlands and in merseyside , by early 2008 .
unite has said it would prefer it if jaguar land rover stayed as part of parent company ford .
but , if a sale is decided , it felt tata had a good manufacturing background .
aston martin tony woodley of unite said the workforce 's best interests would be served by finding a partner with an established presence and background in manufacturing .
he said the stewards had made their decision based on the reports from the presentations made by all the short listed bidders .
jaguar has about 10,000 staff at sites in coventry , birmingham and liverpool , while land rover employs about 9,000 in the west midlands and warwickshire .
earlier this year ford sold off its aston martin brand , also based in warwickshire .
ford has said it has had a number of bidders for its jaguar land rover divisions .

now a £ 14m funding shortfall is causing concern .
but a look behind the scenes at the famous ship 's dry dock in greenwich , south-east london , reveals work to resurrect the historic tea clipper is continuing apace - and shows no signs of slowing down .
in its heyday in the late 19th century , the cutty sark was crewed by hardy seamen who guided the craft halfway across the world to collect a lucrative cargo of fresh tea from china .
now it is men and women in luminous jackets , hard hats and steel toe-capped boots who are responsible for the craft .
they can be seen everywhere inside the scaffolding-and-tarpaulin enclosure that surrounds the vessel .
building site as they clamber up and down ladders and along the multiple levels of steel walkways constructed around the hull of the ship , it is clear a determined and tireless team effort is under way .
the noise around the ship is reminiscent of a building site with shouted instructions punctuated by the roar of heavy duty power tools and the throb of a large crane manoeuvring .
the blaze that tore through the cutty sark in the early hours of monday , 21 may 2007 , set the project 's estimated completion date back a year to 2010 and has caused a multi-million pound funding shortfall .
but the team behind its refurbishment say it could have been much worse . "
it 's very physical , dirty work . but it 's great fun as well " ben delap conservation technician at the time the fire struck , half of the ship 's timbers , fixtures and fittings had already been removed and taken to chatham 's historic dockyard in kent as part of the conservation project .
this meant they escaped the furnace-like blaze , which reached temperatures as high as 1,000c .
and as stephen archer , of cutty sark enterprises , explained , the ship 's construction - teak timbers mounted on an iron frame - ensured the remainder of the vessel survived relatively unscathed .
he said : " if it had been an entirely iron ship , or made only of timber , we might have lost it .
an iron ship would have distorted ; timber would have burned .
" being a composite meant the whole iron frame - the ' birdcage ' - expanded and contracted again .
it returned to within a couple of millimetres of its original shape . "
mr archer said three decks were reduced to ashes by the fire but two of them were not made of the original wood and one was rotten and in need of replacement anyway .
" we only lost five percent of original material .
and the fire is now going to be part of its future story , " he said .
painstaking process that story is already unfolding .
to put it at its most simplistic , the conservationists are dismantling the cutty sark piece by piece , repairing every last timber , nut , bolt and furnishing , ahead of putting the whole vessel back together again .
ben delap is one of the conservation technicians working on the ship .
his day consists of scraping old tar and felt from the hull 's timbers .
he and his colleagues then remove the huge teak planks one by one ; a painstaking and tiring process involving the loosening of up to 50 rusty nuts and bolts - and heavy lifting .
mr delap said : " it 's back-breaking work , pretty much what you would find in a victorian shipyard but in reverse - we are deconstructing this massive beast .
" i certainly sleep well , there 's no doubt about that .
it 's very physical , dirty work - crawling around in tiny spaces and working with heavy industrial tools - but it 's great fun as well . "
braced by new timber , each aging plank is carefully eased into specially-made wooden casings .
they are then lifted by crane into a steel container for transportation to a warehouse in greenwich .
once there , reclaimed teak is used to repair any damage to the original wood and specialist epoxy resin adhesives are used to bind cracks and fissures .
of a total of 500 hull planks , 250 had already been removed when the fire struck .
a further 75 planks have since been taken away .
eventually they 'll be brought back and reattached to the cutty sark 's iron frame after it has been specially treated for rust .
once the masts , coach-housing , sails and rigging are back in place , the cutty sark will once again look like the majestic ship it was before rust , age and fire took their toll .
mr delap said : " the incredible thing is this is the easy part .
putting it back together is going to be the challenge but we have a great team and we are well up to it . "
clare durrant is a documentation assistant for the conservation team .
it is her job to make a note of all the pieces of this most complex of jigsaw puzzles .
" it 's a job but you stop sometimes and think , ' it 's amazing working on something like this , it really is ' . "

now it is men and women in luminous jackets , hard hats and steel toe-capped boots who are responsible for the craft .
they can be seen everywhere inside the scaffolding-and-tarpaulin enclosure that surrounds the vessel .
building site as they clamber up and down ladders and along the multiple levels of steel walkways constructed around the hull of the ship , it is clear a determined and tireless team effort is under way .
the noise around the ship is reminiscent of a building site with shouted instructions punctuated by the roar of heavy duty power tools and the throb of a large crane manoeuvring .
the blaze that tore through the cutty sark in the early hours of monday , 21 may 2007 , set the project 's estimated completion date back a year to 2010 and has caused a multi-million pound funding shortfall .
but the team behind its refurbishment say it could have been much worse .
it 's very physical , dirty work . but it 's great fun as well ben delap conservation technician at the time the fire struck , half of the ship 's timbers , fixtures and fittings had already been removed and taken to chatham 's historic dockyard in kent as part of the conservation project .
this meant they escaped the furnace-like blaze , which reached temperatures as high as 1,000c .
and as stephen archer , of cutty sark enterprises , explained , the ship 's construction - teak timbers mounted on an iron frame - ensured the remainder of the vessel survived relatively unscathed .
he said : " if it had been an entirely iron ship , or made only of timber , we might have lost it .
an iron ship would have distorted ; timber would have burned .
" being a composite meant the whole iron frame - the ' birdcage ' - expanded and contracted again .
it returned to within a couple of millimetres of its original shape . "
mr archer said three decks were reduced to ashes by the fire but two of them were not made of the original wood and one was rotten and in need of replacement anyway .
" we only lost five percent of original material .
and the fire is now going to be part of its future story , " he said .
painstaking process that story is already unfolding .
to put it at its most simplistic , the conservationists are dismantling the cutty sark piece by piece , repairing every last timber , nut , bolt and furnishing , ahead of putting the whole vessel back together again .
a new plank is used to brace one of the hull 's timbers before removal ben delap is one of the conservation technicians working on the ship .
his day consists of scraping old tar and felt from the hull 's timbers .
he and his colleagues then remove the huge teak planks one by one ; a painstaking and tiring process involving the loosening of up to 50 rusty nuts and bolts - and heavy lifting .
mr delap said : " it 's back-breaking work , pretty much what you would find in a victorian shipyard but in reverse - we are deconstructing this massive beast .
" i certainly sleep well , there 's no doubt about that .
it 's very physical , dirty work - crawling around in tiny spaces and working with heavy industrial tools - but it 's great fun as well . "
braced by new timber , each aging plank is carefully eased into specially-made wooden casings .
a worker scrapes old tar from the cutty sark 's hull timbers they are then lifted by crane into a steel container for transportation to a warehouse in greenwich .
once there , reclaimed teak is used to repair any damage to the original wood and specialist epoxy resin adhesives are used to bind cracks and fissures .
of a total of 500 hull planks , 250 had already been removed when the fire struck .
a further 75 planks have since been taken away .
eventually they 'll be brought back and reattached to the cutty sark 's iron frame after it has been specially treated for rust .
once the masts , coach-housing , sails and rigging are back in place , the cutty sark will once again look like the majestic ship it was before rust , age and fire took their toll .
mr delap said : " the incredible thing is this is the easy part .
putting it back together is going to be the challenge but we have a great team and we are well up to it . "
clare durrant is a documentation assistant for the conservation team .
it is her job to make a note of all the pieces of this most complex of jigsaw puzzles .
" it 's a job but you stop sometimes and think , ' it 's amazing working on something like this , it really is ' . "

now a £ 14m funding shortfall is causing concern .
but a look behind the scenes at the famous ship 's dry dock in greenwich , south-east london , reveals work to resurrect the historic tea clipper is continuing apace - and shows no signs of slowing down .
cutty sark salvage and repair in pictures in its heyday in the late 19th century , the cutty sark was crewed by hardy seamen who guided the craft halfway across the world to collect a lucrative cargo of fresh tea from china .
now it is men and women in luminous jackets , hard hats and steel toe-capped boots who are responsible for the craft .
they can be seen everywhere inside the scaffolding-and-tarpaulin enclosure that surrounds the vessel .
building site as they clamber up and down ladders and along the multiple levels of steel walkways constructed around the hull of the ship , it is clear a determined and tireless team effort is under way .
the noise around the ship is reminiscent of a building site with shouted instructions punctuated by the roar of heavy duty power tools and the throb of a large crane manoeuvring .
the blaze that tore through the cutty sark in the early hours of monday , 21 may 2007 , set the project 's estimated completion date back a year to 2010 and has caused a multi-million pound funding shortfall .
but the team behind its refurbishment say it could have been much worse .
it 's very physical , dirty work . but it 's great fun as well ben delap conservation technician at the time the fire struck , half of the ship 's timbers , fixtures and fittings had already been removed and taken to chatham 's historic dockyard in kent as part of the conservation project .
this meant they escaped the furnace-like blaze , which reached temperatures as high as 1,000c .
and as stephen archer , of cutty sark enterprises , explained , the ship 's construction - teak timbers mounted on an iron frame - ensured the remainder of the vessel survived relatively unscathed .
he said : " if it had been an entirely iron ship , or made only of timber , we might have lost it .
an iron ship would have distorted ; timber would have burned .
" being a composite meant the whole iron frame - the ' birdcage ' - expanded and contracted again .
it returned to within a couple of millimetres of its original shape . "
mr archer said three decks were reduced to ashes by the fire but two of them were not made of the original wood and one was rotten and in need of replacement anyway .
" we only lost five percent of original material .
and the fire is now going to be part of its future story , " he said .
painstaking process that story is already unfolding .
to put it at its most simplistic , the conservationists are dismantling the cutty sark piece by piece , repairing every last timber , nut , bolt and furnishing , ahead of putting the whole vessel back together again .
a new plank is used to brace one of the hull 's timbers before removal ben delap is one of the conservation technicians working on the ship .
his day consists of scraping old tar and felt from the hull 's timbers .
he and his colleagues then remove the huge teak planks one by one ; a painstaking and tiring process involving the loosening of up to 50 rusty nuts and bolts - and heavy lifting .
mr delap said : " it 's back-breaking work , pretty much what you would find in a victorian shipyard but in reverse - we are deconstructing this massive beast .
" i certainly sleep well , there 's no doubt about that .
it 's very physical , dirty work - crawling around in tiny spaces and working with heavy industrial tools - but it 's great fun as well . "
braced by new timber , each aging plank is carefully eased into specially-made wooden casings .
a worker scrapes old tar from the cutty sark 's hull timbers they are then lifted by crane into a steel container for transportation to a warehouse in greenwich .
once there , reclaimed teak is used to repair any damage to the original wood and specialist epoxy resin adhesives are used to bind cracks and fissures .
of a total of 500 hull planks , 250 had already been removed when the fire struck .
a further 75 planks have since been taken away .
eventually they 'll be brought back and reattached to the cutty sark 's iron frame after it has been specially treated for rust .
once the masts , coach-housing , sails and rigging are back in place , the cutty sark will once again look like the majestic ship it was before rust , age and fire took their toll .
mr delap said : " the incredible thing is this is the easy part .
putting it back together is going to be the challenge but we have a great team and we are well up to it . "
clare durrant is a documentation assistant for the conservation team .
it is her job to make a note of all the pieces of this most complex of jigsaw puzzles .

but 89 years later , a symbol of their love has been found buried at the bottom of the sea .
the engraved engagement ring was very nearly lost forever but it has now been returned to the sailor 's family in north yorkshire in almost perfect condition .
the gold band was found by amateur diver peter brady , 51 , who spotted the ring during a routine dive around the wreck of hms opal , off the coast of the orkney islands .
at first he thought it was a piece of the ship 's machinery , but on closer inspection a loving inscription was revealed with the words " to stanley from flo , 6 march 1916 " .
mr cubiss , 25 , worked in the engine room when he drowned as hms opal , along with hms narborough , ran aground in a snowstorm on 12 january , 1918 .
he was one of 188 men who perished in the disaster .
he had married his sweetheart florence in june 1917 .
the gold band was found in almost perfect condition keen to hand the ring over to either stanley or florence 's descendants , mr brady and his diving partner bob hamilton began a bid to trace surviving family .
mr hamilton , 61 , said : " we 've dived the site several times but have never found any significant wreckage .
" when we realised peter had found something of such a personal nature we knew we had to try and return it to the family . "
' touching ' phone call having found the ship 's casualty list on the internet and with information from the 1901 census , the divers , with the help of mr hamilton 's wife sue , placed mr cubiss ' parents in yorkshire .

it has been found to be over-active in many different types of cancer .
the latest research , funded by sparks and the neuroblastoma society , looked at more than 400 patients with either colon cancer , a brain tumour called neuroblastoma , or chronic myeloid leukaemia .
their version of the b-myb gene was analysed and compared to the versions found in 230 " controls " - volunteers with no known cancer .
they found that the cancer patients were half as likely to carry the gene variants in question compared with the controls .
dr sala said : " this would suggest that we have found a key player in the genetic influences in cancer .
although the results are statistically significant , we would certainly want to see the scale of the effect confirmed in a much larger study .
" people who carry these gene variants might well be protected against cancer . "
common find the percentage of people in the population who carry the potentially beneficial variants varies between ethnic groups .
as many as 50 % of people in africa may carry it , and perhaps slightly fewer in europe and the us .
it is one of the most commonly held gene variants so far which has been found to be potentially protective against cancer .
henry scowcroft , cancer research uk 's senior scientific information officer said : " there 's a huge effort going on around the world to identify the genetic variations that affect people 's risks of cancer , and cancer research uk is heavily involved with this work .
" if confirmed in larger studies , the existence of a genetic variant that can reduce the chances of cancer in people who carry it is very exciting .
" discovering exactly how it might protect against the disease could allow researchers to explore new avenues of cancer prevention .
but it 's still early days . "
