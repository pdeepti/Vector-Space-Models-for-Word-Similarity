24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness .

we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region . " it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .
some 70 relatives were among the 300 invited guests . crime to defend abduction on saturday , german prosecutors announced they were investigating former raf member rolf wagner for defending the september 1977 abduction of schleyer , who was then head of west germany 's powerful employers ' organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer holds a sign reading : " prisoner for 31 days " during schleyer 's kidnapping , three of the businessman 's police bodyguards were killed , as was as his driver .
after 43 days in captivity , schleyer was murdered following the german government 's refusal to give in to raf demands for the release of 11 of baader-meinhof gang 's members . " from today 's perspective , " the kidnapping was justified , wagner had told the newspaper junge welt .
others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions . " wagner , who spent 24 years in prison for his role in the schleyer kidnapping , was released in 2003 after a presidential pardon . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all three german participants are battling to qualify for the knock-out phase . germany 's champions league representatives are still struggling to get a handle on europe 's premier club competition this year , with werder bremen , schalke 04 and bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart offering woeful group stage performances .
bremen , after suffering back-to-back defeats at real madrid and home to olympiakos , gave themselves a faint lifeline on wednesday , oct .
24 , however , when they sealed an impressive 2-1 win at home to injury-hit italian side lazio .
a first-half goal by bremen 's ivory coast striker boubacar sanogo calmed the nerves before his portuguese striking partner hugo almeida sealed the win with a second-half strike , before the italians grabbed a late consolation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boubacar sanogo gets bremen off the mark " we were definitely the better team , " said bremen 's injured midfielder tim borowski .
" unfortunately , we relaxed a bit too much at the end , but we held on for the win and we have to build on this now to keep our champions league hopes alive . "
this was the italians first defeat in group c after draws against the greek and spanish champions as bremen leap-frogged them into third place .
real top the group after a 4-2 win over olympiakos in madrid on wednesday night , which puts the greeks second .
schalke 04 lose again in london schalke 's chances of progressing out of the group stage and into the knock-out phase took another blow when they went down 2-0 to chelsea in london .
chelsea were gifted the lead when schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer let florent malouda 's shot trickle through his legs before didier drogba scored with a second half header at stamford bridge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's drogba seals the win with the second goal schalke coach mirko slomka felt drogba 's goal killed off his side .
" the goals came at bad moments and that affected our motivation .
the second goal was a bitter blow but there may have been a question of it being offside , " he said .
" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .
german champions crash to third defeat stuttgart 's participation in the champions league looks to be going no further than group e after the bundesliga champions suffered their third straight defeat in europe at the hands of lyon on tuesday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's karim benzema heaps more misery on vfb a deflected strike by fabio dos santos and a goal by karim benzema were enough to give the stuttering french champions the win , their first in this season 's competition .
the result left stuttgart firmly rooted to the bottom of the group , their winless performance mirroring that of their domestic form - they lie fifth from bottom of the bundesliga with just 10 points from 10 games , the worst start to a season in history for the defending champions .
stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .
" at the end of the day , we did n't have many chances , unlike lyon , " he said .
" we should have at least held on for a draw but lyon scored and then made the most of the situation . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "

we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .

the second goal was a bitter blow but there may have been a question of it being offside , " he said .
" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .
german champions crash to third defeat stuttgart 's participation in the champions league looks to be going no further than group e after the bundesliga champions suffered their third straight defeat in europe at the hands of lyon on tuesday night .

the result left stuttgart firmly rooted to the bottom of the group , their winless performance mirroring that of their domestic form - they lie fifth from bottom of the bundesliga with just 10 points from 10 games , the worst start to a season in history for the defending champions .
stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .
some 70 relatives were among the 300 invited guests . crime to defend abduction on saturday , german prosecutors announced they were investigating former raf member rolf wagner for defending the september 1977 abduction of schleyer , who was then head of west germany 's powerful employers ' organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer holds a sign reading : " prisoner for 31 days " during schleyer 's kidnapping , three of the businessman 's police bodyguards were killed , as was as his driver .
after 43 days in captivity , schleyer was murdered following the german government 's refusal to give in to raf demands for the release of 11 of baader-meinhof gang 's members . " from today 's perspective , " the kidnapping was justified , wagner had told the newspaper junge welt .
others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions .

greece is the last of the archive 's 11 governing countries to approve amending the treaty governing the nazi-era documents .
france voted in favor of the changes last week , and the us , israel , britain , belgium , luxembourg , the netherlands , poland , germany and italy agreed to the amendments earlier this year .
much of the digital information kept in the archive has already been transferred to national holocaust repositories in countries such as the us and israel , but previously this information was only available to holocaust survivors and their families .
the digital transfers should be completed by the end of 2007 , officials said .
eventually , the information will also be made available to the public via the internet .

" this is an enormously important evolutionary process , " kennedy told the associated press in a telephone interview .

" but it is a step toward searchable , digital databases that will be very important , " he said .

drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "
it was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute nobel prize-winning turkish writer orhan pamuk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey reportedly bombed kurdish targets along the iraq border on wednesday " on freedom of expression , we regret the lack of progress .
we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region . " it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .
some 70 relatives were among the 300 invited guests . crime to defend abduction on saturday , german prosecutors announced they were investigating former raf member rolf wagner for defending the september 1977 abduction of schleyer , who was then head of west germany 's powerful employers ' organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer holds a sign reading : " prisoner for 31 days " during schleyer 's kidnapping , three of the businessman 's police bodyguards were killed , as was as his driver .
after 43 days in captivity , schleyer was murdered following the german government 's refusal to give in to raf demands for the release of 11 of baader-meinhof gang 's members . " from today 's perspective , " the kidnapping was justified , wagner had told the newspaper junge welt .
others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions . " wagner , who spent 24 years in prison for his role in the schleyer kidnapping , was released in 2003 after a presidential pardon . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece is the last of the archive 's 11 governing countries to approve amending the treaty governing the nazi-era documents .
france voted in favor of the changes last week , and the us , israel , britain , belgium , luxembourg , the netherlands , poland , germany and italy agreed to the amendments earlier this year .
much of the digital information kept in the archive has already been transferred to national holocaust repositories in countries such as the us and israel , but previously this information was only available to holocaust survivors and their families .
the digital transfers should be completed by the end of 2007 , officials said .
eventually , the information will also be made available to the public via the internet .
the archives , which is overseen by the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- - an arm of the red cross - consist of up to 100 million digital pages of information .
this is divided into separate collections covering detention records , forced and slave labor , and displaced persons as well as an index containing around 17 million names .

survivors of nazi concentration camps have used information stored in bad arolsen to claim pensions and get compensation .
in addition , families have combed the archives in search of information about what happened to loved ones during the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information will be sent to national holocaust repositories the united states led the campaign to open the archives to researchers and the general public , arguing that it needs to happen before the last holocaust survivors die .
ambassador j. christian kennedy , the u.s. special envoy for holocaust issues , has spearheaded efforts to open the archive to the public .
" this is an enormously important evolutionary process , " kennedy told the associated press in a telephone interview .
" we have now come to the end of the political and diplomatic part of the process , " he said from thessaloniki , where he was meeting with greek officials and representatives of the jewish community .
painting a picture of the holocaust bildunterschrift : the archive tells the stories of individuals killed by the nazis with its gestapo reports , victim testimonials and other firsthand sources , the archive provides an amazing amount of information about the minutiae of life and death in world war ii concentration camps .
the archive materials are so complex that for the time being , people will still have to rely on the archivists , kennedy said .
" but it is a step toward searchable , digital databases that will be very important , " he said .
experts hope historians and descendants of victims can use the information to get a better understanding of what happened to individuals during the holocaust . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "
it was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute nobel prize-winning turkish writer orhan pamuk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey reportedly bombed kurdish targets along the iraq border on wednesday " on freedom of expression , we regret the lack of progress .
we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region . " it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .

" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 25.10.2007 russia rejects new us offer on missile defense at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said that the us defense proposals were unacceptable russian officials said they were no closer to agreeing with the us over planned missile bases in eastern europe at an informal meeting of nato which however managed to drum up fresh troops for afghanistan . the row between the united states and russia over the proposed stationing of bases for a missile defense shield in eastern europe was once more addressed at a meeting of nato defense ministers in the netherlands but there was little progress in easing tensions .
russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "

other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .

the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .

sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .
10 , but also beyond that , whatever else happens , " ischinger said in an interview on wednesday .
" this is regardless of whether -lsb- kosovo and serbia -rsb- agree or disagree . " negotiations show no headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger is positive about kosovo 's status being resoved following the latest unsuccessful round of internationally mediated talks between serbian and albanian negotiators held on monday in vienna , ischinger complained that both sides were too focused on their own political agendas . " i believe that it is possible to solve the kosovo issue , " ischinger said . " the question that i ca n't answer is whether both parties - that in the end have come to an agreement - have enough political will to carry out this agreement , " he said . on friday , russia 's president vladimir putin is due to meet with top eu officials at the second of the twice-yearly eu-russia summits .
analysts say that with russian parliamentary elections in december , the summit is unlikely to produce anything concrete on the kosovo problem . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .
10 , but also beyond that , whatever else happens , " ischinger said in an interview on wednesday .
" this is regardless of whether -lsb- kosovo and serbia -rsb- agree or disagree . " negotiations show no headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger is positive about kosovo 's status being resoved following the latest unsuccessful round of internationally mediated talks between serbian and albanian negotiators held on monday in vienna , ischinger complained that both sides were too focused on their own political agendas . " i believe that it is possible to solve the kosovo issue , " ischinger said . " the question that i ca n't answer is whether both parties - that in the end have come to an agreement - have enough political will to carry out this agreement , " he said . on friday , russia 's president vladimir putin is due to meet with top eu officials at the second of the twice-yearly eu-russia summits .
analysts say that with russian parliamentary elections in december , the summit is unlikely to produce anything concrete on the kosovo problem . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .

his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .

his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 25.10.2007 russia rejects new us offer on missile defense at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said that the us defense proposals were unacceptable russian officials said they were no closer to agreeing with the us over planned missile bases in eastern europe at an informal meeting of nato which however managed to drum up fresh troops for afghanistan . the row between the united states and russia over the proposed stationing of bases for a missile defense shield in eastern europe was once more addressed at a meeting of nato defense ministers in the netherlands but there was little progress in easing tensions .
russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .

" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .
10 , but also beyond that , whatever else happens , " ischinger said in an interview on wednesday .
" this is regardless of whether -lsb- kosovo and serbia -rsb- agree or disagree . " negotiations show no headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger is positive about kosovo 's status being resoved following the latest unsuccessful round of internationally mediated talks between serbian and albanian negotiators held on monday in vienna , ischinger complained that both sides were too focused on their own political agendas . " i believe that it is possible to solve the kosovo issue , " ischinger said . " the question that i ca n't answer is whether both parties - that in the end have come to an agreement - have enough political will to carry out this agreement , " he said . on friday , russia 's president vladimir putin is due to meet with top eu officials at the second of the twice-yearly eu-russia summits .
analysts say that with russian parliamentary elections in december , the summit is unlikely to produce anything concrete on the kosovo problem . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "
it was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute nobel prize-winning turkish writer orhan pamuk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey reportedly bombed kurdish targets along the iraq border on wednesday " on freedom of expression , we regret the lack of progress .
we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region . " it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "

we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region .

experts estimate that around 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the violence in darfur since mostly non-arab rebels began a war against the sudanese government in early 2003 , accusing it of neglect .
the sudanese government puts the death toll at 9,000 and says the west exaggerates the conflict .
" the european parliament wants to recognize the very important work of this very courageous man , who has made his voice heard to make sure the rule of law is being supported in sudan , " the president of the parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said in announcing the prize , adding that the choice had been unanimous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced woman line up to receive food at a camp in northern darfur the two other finalists for the prize were murdered anti-kremlin journalist anna politkovskaya and chinese activists hu jia and zeng jinyan who were detained by chinese police in april .
osman risked his own life for others " over two decades during sudan 's various civil wars , salih mahmoud osman has risked his own life to provide legal and medical aid to the countless victims of the conflict , " a statement on the european parliament 's web site read .
" his fight against injustice has had a personal cost ; members of his family have been killed and tortured . "
osman himself was imprisoned by the sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without a charge or a trial .
he was also awarded human rights watch 's highest honor for his work in sudan in november 2005 .
the sakharov prize , named after soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded by the european parliament annually since 1988 to individuals or organizations who " have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy " .
global luminaries make up list of previous winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the board unanimously decided on osman the winner receives 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,000 -rrb- and previous laureates include former south african leader nelson mandela , burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi and ex-un secretary general kofi annan .
last year 's winner was belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich .
the prizewinner is chosen by the european parliament 's president and the heads of political groups in the parliament .

all three german participants are battling to qualify for the knock-out phase . germany 's champions league representatives are still struggling to get a handle on europe 's premier club competition this year , with werder bremen , schalke 04 and bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart offering woeful group stage performances .
bremen , after suffering back-to-back defeats at real madrid and home to olympiakos , gave themselves a faint lifeline on wednesday , oct .
24 , however , when they sealed an impressive 2-1 win at home to injury-hit italian side lazio .
a first-half goal by bremen 's ivory coast striker boubacar sanogo calmed the nerves before his portuguese striking partner hugo almeida sealed the win with a second-half strike , before the italians grabbed a late consolation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boubacar sanogo gets bremen off the mark " we were definitely the better team , " said bremen 's injured midfielder tim borowski .
" unfortunately , we relaxed a bit too much at the end , but we held on for the win and we have to build on this now to keep our champions league hopes alive . "
this was the italians first defeat in group c after draws against the greek and spanish champions as bremen leap-frogged them into third place .
real top the group after a 4-2 win over olympiakos in madrid on wednesday night , which puts the greeks second .
schalke 04 lose again in london schalke 's chances of progressing out of the group stage and into the knock-out phase took another blow when they went down 2-0 to chelsea in london .
chelsea were gifted the lead when schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer let florent malouda 's shot trickle through his legs before didier drogba scored with a second half header at stamford bridge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's drogba seals the win with the second goal schalke coach mirko slomka felt drogba 's goal killed off his side .
" the goals came at bad moments and that affected our motivation .
the second goal was a bitter blow but there may have been a question of it being offside , " he said .
" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .
german champions crash to third defeat stuttgart 's participation in the champions league looks to be going no further than group e after the bundesliga champions suffered their third straight defeat in europe at the hands of lyon on tuesday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's karim benzema heaps more misery on vfb a deflected strike by fabio dos santos and a goal by karim benzema were enough to give the stuttering french champions the win , their first in this season 's competition .
the result left stuttgart firmly rooted to the bottom of the group , their winless performance mirroring that of their domestic form - they lie fifth from bottom of the bundesliga with just 10 points from 10 games , the worst start to a season in history for the defending champions .
stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .
" at the end of the day , we did n't have many chances , unlike lyon , " he said .
" we should have at least held on for a draw but lyon scored and then made the most of the situation . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .

officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .
some 70 relatives were among the 300 invited guests . crime to defend abduction on saturday , german prosecutors announced they were investigating former raf member rolf wagner for defending the september 1977 abduction of schleyer , who was then head of west germany 's powerful employers ' organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer holds a sign reading : " prisoner for 31 days " during schleyer 's kidnapping , three of the businessman 's police bodyguards were killed , as was as his driver .
after 43 days in captivity , schleyer was murdered following the german government 's refusal to give in to raf demands for the release of 11 of baader-meinhof gang 's members . " from today 's perspective , " the kidnapping was justified , wagner had told the newspaper junge welt .
others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions . " wagner , who spent 24 years in prison for his role in the schleyer kidnapping , was released in 2003 after a presidential pardon . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .

" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .

however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .

greece is the last of the archive 's 11 governing countries to approve amending the treaty governing the nazi-era documents .
france voted in favor of the changes last week , and the us , israel , britain , belgium , luxembourg , the netherlands , poland , germany and italy agreed to the amendments earlier this year .
much of the digital information kept in the archive has already been transferred to national holocaust repositories in countries such as the us and israel , but previously this information was only available to holocaust survivors and their families .
the digital transfers should be completed by the end of 2007 , officials said .
eventually , the information will also be made available to the public via the internet .
the archives , which is overseen by the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- - an arm of the red cross - consist of up to 100 million digital pages of information .
this is divided into separate collections covering detention records , forced and slave labor , and displaced persons as well as an index containing around 17 million names .

survivors of nazi concentration camps have used information stored in bad arolsen to claim pensions and get compensation .
in addition , families have combed the archives in search of information about what happened to loved ones during the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information will be sent to national holocaust repositories the united states led the campaign to open the archives to researchers and the general public , arguing that it needs to happen before the last holocaust survivors die .
ambassador j. christian kennedy , the u.s. special envoy for holocaust issues , has spearheaded efforts to open the archive to the public .
" this is an enormously important evolutionary process , " kennedy told the associated press in a telephone interview .
" we have now come to the end of the political and diplomatic part of the process , " he said from thessaloniki , where he was meeting with greek officials and representatives of the jewish community .
painting a picture of the holocaust bildunterschrift : the archive tells the stories of individuals killed by the nazis with its gestapo reports , victim testimonials and other firsthand sources , the archive provides an amazing amount of information about the minutiae of life and death in world war ii concentration camps .
the archive materials are so complex that for the time being , people will still have to rely on the archivists , kennedy said .
" but it is a step toward searchable , digital databases that will be very important , " he said .
experts hope historians and descendants of victims can use the information to get a better understanding of what happened to individuals during the holocaust . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all three german participants are battling to qualify for the knock-out phase . germany 's champions league representatives are still struggling to get a handle on europe 's premier club competition this year , with werder bremen , schalke 04 and bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart offering woeful group stage performances .
bremen , after suffering back-to-back defeats at real madrid and home to olympiakos , gave themselves a faint lifeline on wednesday , oct .
24 , however , when they sealed an impressive 2-1 win at home to injury-hit italian side lazio .
a first-half goal by bremen 's ivory coast striker boubacar sanogo calmed the nerves before his portuguese striking partner hugo almeida sealed the win with a second-half strike , before the italians grabbed a late consolation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boubacar sanogo gets bremen off the mark " we were definitely the better team , " said bremen 's injured midfielder tim borowski .
" unfortunately , we relaxed a bit too much at the end , but we held on for the win and we have to build on this now to keep our champions league hopes alive . "
this was the italians first defeat in group c after draws against the greek and spanish champions as bremen leap-frogged them into third place .
real top the group after a 4-2 win over olympiakos in madrid on wednesday night , which puts the greeks second .
schalke 04 lose again in london schalke 's chances of progressing out of the group stage and into the knock-out phase took another blow when they went down 2-0 to chelsea in london .
chelsea were gifted the lead when schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer let florent malouda 's shot trickle through his legs before didier drogba scored with a second half header at stamford bridge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's drogba seals the win with the second goal schalke coach mirko slomka felt drogba 's goal killed off his side .
" the goals came at bad moments and that affected our motivation .
the second goal was a bitter blow but there may have been a question of it being offside , " he said .
" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .
german champions crash to third defeat stuttgart 's participation in the champions league looks to be going no further than group e after the bundesliga champions suffered their third straight defeat in europe at the hands of lyon on tuesday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's karim benzema heaps more misery on vfb a deflected strike by fabio dos santos and a goal by karim benzema were enough to give the stuttering french champions the win , their first in this season 's competition .
the result left stuttgart firmly rooted to the bottom of the group , their winless performance mirroring that of their domestic form - they lie fifth from bottom of the bundesliga with just 10 points from 10 games , the worst start to a season in history for the defending champions .
stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .
" at the end of the day , we did n't have many chances , unlike lyon , " he said .
" we should have at least held on for a draw but lyon scored and then made the most of the situation . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .

other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.10.2007 european commission calls for further turkey accession talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president is a vocal opponent to turkey 's eu membership the official in charge of the eu 's enlargement policy has called for the bloc to begin further talks with turkey about its future eu membership in a speech which could provoke a clash with france . " all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "
it was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute nobel prize-winning turkish writer orhan pamuk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey reportedly bombed kurdish targets along the iraq border on wednesday " on freedom of expression , we regret the lack of progress .
we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region . " it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "
it was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute nobel prize-winning turkish writer orhan pamuk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey reportedly bombed kurdish targets along the iraq border on wednesday " on freedom of expression , we regret the lack of progress .
we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region . " it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .
10 , but also beyond that , whatever else happens , " ischinger said in an interview on wednesday .
" this is regardless of whether -lsb- kosovo and serbia -rsb- agree or disagree . " negotiations show no headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger is positive about kosovo 's status being resoved following the latest unsuccessful round of internationally mediated talks between serbian and albanian negotiators held on monday in vienna , ischinger complained that both sides were too focused on their own political agendas . " i believe that it is possible to solve the kosovo issue , " ischinger said . " the question that i ca n't answer is whether both parties - that in the end have come to an agreement - have enough political will to carry out this agreement , " he said . on friday , russia 's president vladimir putin is due to meet with top eu officials at the second of the twice-yearly eu-russia summits .
analysts say that with russian parliamentary elections in december , the summit is unlikely to produce anything concrete on the kosovo problem . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "

experts estimate that around 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the violence in darfur since mostly non-arab rebels began a war against the sudanese government in early 2003 , accusing it of neglect .
the sudanese government puts the death toll at 9,000 and says the west exaggerates the conflict .
" the european parliament wants to recognize the very important work of this very courageous man , who has made his voice heard to make sure the rule of law is being supported in sudan , " the president of the parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said in announcing the prize , adding that the choice had been unanimous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced woman line up to receive food at a camp in northern darfur the two other finalists for the prize were murdered anti-kremlin journalist anna politkovskaya and chinese activists hu jia and zeng jinyan who were detained by chinese police in april .
osman risked his own life for others " over two decades during sudan 's various civil wars , salih mahmoud osman has risked his own life to provide legal and medical aid to the countless victims of the conflict , " a statement on the european parliament 's web site read .
" his fight against injustice has had a personal cost ; members of his family have been killed and tortured . "
osman himself was imprisoned by the sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without a charge or a trial .
he was also awarded human rights watch 's highest honor for his work in sudan in november 2005 .
the sakharov prize , named after soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded by the european parliament annually since 1988 to individuals or organizations who " have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy " .

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .

greece is the last of the archive 's 11 governing countries to approve amending the treaty governing the nazi-era documents .
france voted in favor of the changes last week , and the us , israel , britain , belgium , luxembourg , the netherlands , poland , germany and italy agreed to the amendments earlier this year .
much of the digital information kept in the archive has already been transferred to national holocaust repositories in countries such as the us and israel , but previously this information was only available to holocaust survivors and their families .
the digital transfers should be completed by the end of 2007 , officials said .
eventually , the information will also be made available to the public via the internet .
the archives , which is overseen by the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- - an arm of the red cross - consist of up to 100 million digital pages of information .
this is divided into separate collections covering detention records , forced and slave labor , and displaced persons as well as an index containing around 17 million names .
firsthand documentation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive 's contents can help educate people about the holocaust the archive in bad arolsen north of frankfurt helps tell the individual stories of some of the six million jews who were murdered by the nazis .
survivors of nazi concentration camps have used information stored in bad arolsen to claim pensions and get compensation .
in addition , families have combed the archives in search of information about what happened to loved ones during the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information will be sent to national holocaust repositories the united states led the campaign to open the archives to researchers and the general public , arguing that it needs to happen before the last holocaust survivors die .
ambassador j. christian kennedy , the u.s. special envoy for holocaust issues , has spearheaded efforts to open the archive to the public .
" this is an enormously important evolutionary process , " kennedy told the associated press in a telephone interview .
" we have now come to the end of the political and diplomatic part of the process , " he said from thessaloniki , where he was meeting with greek officials and representatives of the jewish community .
painting a picture of the holocaust bildunterschrift : the archive tells the stories of individuals killed by the nazis with its gestapo reports , victim testimonials and other firsthand sources , the archive provides an amazing amount of information about the minutiae of life and death in world war ii concentration camps .
the archive materials are so complex that for the time being , people will still have to rely on the archivists , kennedy said .
" but it is a step toward searchable , digital databases that will be very important , " he said .
experts hope historians and descendants of victims can use the information to get a better understanding of what happened to individuals during the holocaust . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .

" last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness .

experts estimate that around 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the violence in darfur since mostly non-arab rebels began a war against the sudanese government in early 2003 , accusing it of neglect .
the sudanese government puts the death toll at 9,000 and says the west exaggerates the conflict .
" the european parliament wants to recognize the very important work of this very courageous man , who has made his voice heard to make sure the rule of law is being supported in sudan , " the president of the parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said in announcing the prize , adding that the choice had been unanimous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced woman line up to receive food at a camp in northern darfur the two other finalists for the prize were murdered anti-kremlin journalist anna politkovskaya and chinese activists hu jia and zeng jinyan who were detained by chinese police in april .
osman risked his own life for others " over two decades during sudan 's various civil wars , salih mahmoud osman has risked his own life to provide legal and medical aid to the countless victims of the conflict , " a statement on the european parliament 's web site read .
" his fight against injustice has had a personal cost ; members of his family have been killed and tortured . "
osman himself was imprisoned by the sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without a charge or a trial .
he was also awarded human rights watch 's highest honor for his work in sudan in november 2005 .
the sakharov prize , named after soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded by the european parliament annually since 1988 to individuals or organizations who " have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .

"
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .

all three german participants are battling to qualify for the knock-out phase . germany 's champions league representatives are still struggling to get a handle on europe 's premier club competition this year , with werder bremen , schalke 04 and bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart offering woeful group stage performances .
bremen , after suffering back-to-back defeats at real madrid and home to olympiakos , gave themselves a faint lifeline on wednesday , oct .
24 , however , when they sealed an impressive 2-1 win at home to injury-hit italian side lazio .
a first-half goal by bremen 's ivory coast striker boubacar sanogo calmed the nerves before his portuguese striking partner hugo almeida sealed the win with a second-half strike , before the italians grabbed a late consolation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boubacar sanogo gets bremen off the mark " we were definitely the better team , " said bremen 's injured midfielder tim borowski .
" unfortunately , we relaxed a bit too much at the end , but we held on for the win and we have to build on this now to keep our champions league hopes alive . "
this was the italians first defeat in group c after draws against the greek and spanish champions as bremen leap-frogged them into third place .
real top the group after a 4-2 win over olympiakos in madrid on wednesday night , which puts the greeks second .
schalke 04 lose again in london schalke 's chances of progressing out of the group stage and into the knock-out phase took another blow when they went down 2-0 to chelsea in london .
chelsea were gifted the lead when schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer let florent malouda 's shot trickle through his legs before didier drogba scored with a second half header at stamford bridge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's drogba seals the win with the second goal schalke coach mirko slomka felt drogba 's goal killed off his side .
" the goals came at bad moments and that affected our motivation .
the second goal was a bitter blow but there may have been a question of it being offside , " he said .
" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .
german champions crash to third defeat stuttgart 's participation in the champions league looks to be going no further than group e after the bundesliga champions suffered their third straight defeat in europe at the hands of lyon on tuesday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's karim benzema heaps more misery on vfb a deflected strike by fabio dos santos and a goal by karim benzema were enough to give the stuttering french champions the win , their first in this season 's competition .
the result left stuttgart firmly rooted to the bottom of the group , their winless performance mirroring that of their domestic form - they lie fifth from bottom of the bundesliga with just 10 points from 10 games , the worst start to a season in history for the defending champions .
stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .
" at the end of the day , we did n't have many chances , unlike lyon , " he said .
" we should have at least held on for a draw but lyon scored and then made the most of the situation . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bremen , after suffering back-to-back defeats at real madrid and home to olympiakos , gave themselves a faint lifeline on wednesday , oct .
24 , however , when they sealed an impressive 2-1 win at home to injury-hit italian side lazio .
a first-half goal by bremen 's ivory coast striker boubacar sanogo calmed the nerves before his portuguese striking partner hugo almeida sealed the win with a second-half strike , before the italians grabbed a late consolation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boubacar sanogo gets bremen off the mark " we were definitely the better team , " said bremen 's injured midfielder tim borowski .
" unfortunately , we relaxed a bit too much at the end , but we held on for the win and we have to build on this now to keep our champions league hopes alive . "
this was the italians first defeat in group c after draws against the greek and spanish champions as bremen leap-frogged them into third place .

" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .

stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "
it was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute nobel prize-winning turkish writer orhan pamuk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey reportedly bombed kurdish targets along the iraq border on wednesday " on freedom of expression , we regret the lack of progress .

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .

he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .

greece is the last of the archive 's 11 governing countries to approve amending the treaty governing the nazi-era documents .
france voted in favor of the changes last week , and the us , israel , britain , belgium , luxembourg , the netherlands , poland , germany and italy agreed to the amendments earlier this year .
much of the digital information kept in the archive has already been transferred to national holocaust repositories in countries such as the us and israel , but previously this information was only available to holocaust survivors and their families .
the digital transfers should be completed by the end of 2007 , officials said .
eventually , the information will also be made available to the public via the internet .
the archives , which is overseen by the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- - an arm of the red cross - consist of up to 100 million digital pages of information .
this is divided into separate collections covering detention records , forced and slave labor , and displaced persons as well as an index containing around 17 million names .

survivors of nazi concentration camps have used information stored in bad arolsen to claim pensions and get compensation .
in addition , families have combed the archives in search of information about what happened to loved ones during the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information will be sent to national holocaust repositories the united states led the campaign to open the archives to researchers and the general public , arguing that it needs to happen before the last holocaust survivors die .
ambassador j. christian kennedy , the u.s. special envoy for holocaust issues , has spearheaded efforts to open the archive to the public .
" this is an enormously important evolutionary process , " kennedy told the associated press in a telephone interview .
" we have now come to the end of the political and diplomatic part of the process , " he said from thessaloniki , where he was meeting with greek officials and representatives of the jewish community .
painting a picture of the holocaust bildunterschrift : the archive tells the stories of individuals killed by the nazis with its gestapo reports , victim testimonials and other firsthand sources , the archive provides an amazing amount of information about the minutiae of life and death in world war ii concentration camps .
the archive materials are so complex that for the time being , people will still have to rely on the archivists , kennedy said .
" but it is a step toward searchable , digital databases that will be very important , " he said .
experts hope historians and descendants of victims can use the information to get a better understanding of what happened to individuals during the holocaust . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts estimate that around 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the violence in darfur since mostly non-arab rebels began a war against the sudanese government in early 2003 , accusing it of neglect .
the sudanese government puts the death toll at 9,000 and says the west exaggerates the conflict .
" the european parliament wants to recognize the very important work of this very courageous man , who has made his voice heard to make sure the rule of law is being supported in sudan , " the president of the parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said in announcing the prize , adding that the choice had been unanimous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced woman line up to receive food at a camp in northern darfur the two other finalists for the prize were murdered anti-kremlin journalist anna politkovskaya and chinese activists hu jia and zeng jinyan who were detained by chinese police in april .
osman risked his own life for others " over two decades during sudan 's various civil wars , salih mahmoud osman has risked his own life to provide legal and medical aid to the countless victims of the conflict , " a statement on the european parliament 's web site read .
" his fight against injustice has had a personal cost ; members of his family have been killed and tortured . "
osman himself was imprisoned by the sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without a charge or a trial .
he was also awarded human rights watch 's highest honor for his work in sudan in november 2005 .
the sakharov prize , named after soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded by the european parliament annually since 1988 to individuals or organizations who " have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy " .
global luminaries make up list of previous winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the board unanimously decided on osman the winner receives 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,000 -rrb- and previous laureates include former south african leader nelson mandela , burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi and ex-un secretary general kofi annan .

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .
10 , but also beyond that , whatever else happens , " ischinger said in an interview on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.10.2007 german champions league teams struggle to make next round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen notched their first win in the champions league this season over lazio after another week of top-flight european action , there 's still not much to cheer for german soccer fans in the champions league .
all three german participants are battling to qualify for the knock-out phase . germany 's champions league representatives are still struggling to get a handle on europe 's premier club competition this year , with werder bremen , schalke 04 and bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart offering woeful group stage performances .
bremen , after suffering back-to-back defeats at real madrid and home to olympiakos , gave themselves a faint lifeline on wednesday , oct .
24 , however , when they sealed an impressive 2-1 win at home to injury-hit italian side lazio .
a first-half goal by bremen 's ivory coast striker boubacar sanogo calmed the nerves before his portuguese striking partner hugo almeida sealed the win with a second-half strike , before the italians grabbed a late consolation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boubacar sanogo gets bremen off the mark " we were definitely the better team , " said bremen 's injured midfielder tim borowski .
" unfortunately , we relaxed a bit too much at the end , but we held on for the win and we have to build on this now to keep our champions league hopes alive . "
this was the italians first defeat in group c after draws against the greek and spanish champions as bremen leap-frogged them into third place .
real top the group after a 4-2 win over olympiakos in madrid on wednesday night , which puts the greeks second .
schalke 04 lose again in london schalke 's chances of progressing out of the group stage and into the knock-out phase took another blow when they went down 2-0 to chelsea in london .
chelsea were gifted the lead when schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer let florent malouda 's shot trickle through his legs before didier drogba scored with a second half header at stamford bridge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's drogba seals the win with the second goal schalke coach mirko slomka felt drogba 's goal killed off his side .
" the goals came at bad moments and that affected our motivation .
the second goal was a bitter blow but there may have been a question of it being offside , " he said .
" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .
german champions crash to third defeat stuttgart 's participation in the champions league looks to be going no further than group e after the bundesliga champions suffered their third straight defeat in europe at the hands of lyon on tuesday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's karim benzema heaps more misery on vfb a deflected strike by fabio dos santos and a goal by karim benzema were enough to give the stuttering french champions the win , their first in this season 's competition .
the result left stuttgart firmly rooted to the bottom of the group , their winless performance mirroring that of their domestic form - they lie fifth from bottom of the bundesliga with just 10 points from 10 games , the worst start to a season in history for the defending champions .
stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .
" at the end of the day , we did n't have many chances , unlike lyon , " he said .
" we should have at least held on for a draw but lyon scored and then made the most of the situation . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 25.10.2007 russia rejects new us offer on missile defense at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said that the us defense proposals were unacceptable russian officials said they were no closer to agreeing with the us over planned missile bases in eastern europe at an informal meeting of nato which however managed to drum up fresh troops for afghanistan . the row between the united states and russia over the proposed stationing of bases for a missile defense shield in eastern europe was once more addressed at a meeting of nato defense ministers in the netherlands but there was little progress in easing tensions .
russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness .

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness .

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .
some 70 relatives were among the 300 invited guests . crime to defend abduction on saturday , german prosecutors announced they were investigating former raf member rolf wagner for defending the september 1977 abduction of schleyer , who was then head of west germany 's powerful employers ' organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer holds a sign reading : " prisoner for 31 days " during schleyer 's kidnapping , three of the businessman 's police bodyguards were killed , as was as his driver .
after 43 days in captivity , schleyer was murdered following the german government 's refusal to give in to raf demands for the release of 11 of baader-meinhof gang 's members . " from today 's perspective , " the kidnapping was justified , wagner had told the newspaper junge welt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.10.2007 eu 's weakened co2 target angers environmentalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament says it is giving the car industry more time to adapt the fight against pollution and climate change was hit hard by the european parliament 's decision to cut the reduction targets for vehicle carbon-dioxide emissions , the gas most linked to global warning . environmental groups reacted with fury to the vote on wednesday , oct .
24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .

washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .

serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .

greece is the last of the archive 's 11 governing countries to approve amending the treaty governing the nazi-era documents .
france voted in favor of the changes last week , and the us , israel , britain , belgium , luxembourg , the netherlands , poland , germany and italy agreed to the amendments earlier this year .
much of the digital information kept in the archive has already been transferred to national holocaust repositories in countries such as the us and israel , but previously this information was only available to holocaust survivors and their families .
the digital transfers should be completed by the end of 2007 , officials said .
eventually , the information will also be made available to the public via the internet .
the archives , which is overseen by the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- - an arm of the red cross - consist of up to 100 million digital pages of information .
this is divided into separate collections covering detention records , forced and slave labor , and displaced persons as well as an index containing around 17 million names .

survivors of nazi concentration camps have used information stored in bad arolsen to claim pensions and get compensation .
in addition , families have combed the archives in search of information about what happened to loved ones during the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information will be sent to national holocaust repositories the united states led the campaign to open the archives to researchers and the general public , arguing that it needs to happen before the last holocaust survivors die .
ambassador j. christian kennedy , the u.s. special envoy for holocaust issues , has spearheaded efforts to open the archive to the public .
" this is an enormously important evolutionary process , " kennedy told the associated press in a telephone interview .
" we have now come to the end of the political and diplomatic part of the process , " he said from thessaloniki , where he was meeting with greek officials and representatives of the jewish community .
painting a picture of the holocaust bildunterschrift : the archive tells the stories of individuals killed by the nazis with its gestapo reports , victim testimonials and other firsthand sources , the archive provides an amazing amount of information about the minutiae of life and death in world war ii concentration camps .
the archive materials are so complex that for the time being , people will still have to rely on the archivists , kennedy said .
" but it is a step toward searchable , digital databases that will be very important , " he said .
experts hope historians and descendants of victims can use the information to get a better understanding of what happened to individuals during the holocaust . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts estimate that around 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the violence in darfur since mostly non-arab rebels began a war against the sudanese government in early 2003 , accusing it of neglect .
the sudanese government puts the death toll at 9,000 and says the west exaggerates the conflict .
" the european parliament wants to recognize the very important work of this very courageous man , who has made his voice heard to make sure the rule of law is being supported in sudan , " the president of the parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said in announcing the prize , adding that the choice had been unanimous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced woman line up to receive food at a camp in northern darfur the two other finalists for the prize were murdered anti-kremlin journalist anna politkovskaya and chinese activists hu jia and zeng jinyan who were detained by chinese police in april .
osman risked his own life for others " over two decades during sudan 's various civil wars , salih mahmoud osman has risked his own life to provide legal and medical aid to the countless victims of the conflict , " a statement on the european parliament 's web site read .
" his fight against injustice has had a personal cost ; members of his family have been killed and tortured . "
osman himself was imprisoned by the sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without a charge or a trial .
he was also awarded human rights watch 's highest honor for his work in sudan in november 2005 .
the sakharov prize , named after soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded by the european parliament annually since 1988 to individuals or organizations who " have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy " .

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts estimate that around 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the violence in darfur since mostly non-arab rebels began a war against the sudanese government in early 2003 , accusing it of neglect .
the sudanese government puts the death toll at 9,000 and says the west exaggerates the conflict .
" the european parliament wants to recognize the very important work of this very courageous man , who has made his voice heard to make sure the rule of law is being supported in sudan , " the president of the parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said in announcing the prize , adding that the choice had been unanimous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced woman line up to receive food at a camp in northern darfur the two other finalists for the prize were murdered anti-kremlin journalist anna politkovskaya and chinese activists hu jia and zeng jinyan who were detained by chinese police in april .
osman risked his own life for others " over two decades during sudan 's various civil wars , salih mahmoud osman has risked his own life to provide legal and medical aid to the countless victims of the conflict , " a statement on the european parliament 's web site read .
" his fight against injustice has had a personal cost ; members of his family have been killed and tortured . "
osman himself was imprisoned by the sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without a charge or a trial .
he was also awarded human rights watch 's highest honor for his work in sudan in november 2005 .
the sakharov prize , named after soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded by the european parliament annually since 1988 to individuals or organizations who " have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy " .

experts estimate that around 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the violence in darfur since mostly non-arab rebels began a war against the sudanese government in early 2003 , accusing it of neglect .
the sudanese government puts the death toll at 9,000 and says the west exaggerates the conflict .
" the european parliament wants to recognize the very important work of this very courageous man , who has made his voice heard to make sure the rule of law is being supported in sudan , " the president of the parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said in announcing the prize , adding that the choice had been unanimous .

osman risked his own life for others " over two decades during sudan 's various civil wars , salih mahmoud osman has risked his own life to provide legal and medical aid to the countless victims of the conflict , " a statement on the european parliament 's web site read .
" his fight against injustice has had a personal cost ; members of his family have been killed and tortured . "
osman himself was imprisoned by the sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without a charge or a trial .
he was also awarded human rights watch 's highest honor for his work in sudan in november 2005 .
the sakharov prize , named after soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded by the european parliament annually since 1988 to individuals or organizations who " have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.10.2007 eu 's weakened co2 target angers environmentalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament says it is giving the car industry more time to adapt the fight against pollution and climate change was hit hard by the european parliament 's decision to cut the reduction targets for vehicle carbon-dioxide emissions , the gas most linked to global warning . environmental groups reacted with fury to the vote on wednesday , oct .
24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks .

the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .

his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption .

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .
some 70 relatives were among the 300 invited guests . crime to defend abduction on saturday , german prosecutors announced they were investigating former raf member rolf wagner for defending the september 1977 abduction of schleyer , who was then head of west germany 's powerful employers ' organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer holds a sign reading : " prisoner for 31 days " during schleyer 's kidnapping , three of the businessman 's police bodyguards were killed , as was as his driver .
after 43 days in captivity , schleyer was murdered following the german government 's refusal to give in to raf demands for the release of 11 of baader-meinhof gang 's members . " from today 's perspective , " the kidnapping was justified , wagner had told the newspaper junge welt .
others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions . " wagner , who spent 24 years in prison for his role in the schleyer kidnapping , was released in 2003 after a presidential pardon . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 25.10.2007 kosovo status high on agenda at russia 's talks with nato , eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians and serbs have lived with divisions for years as the dec .
10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .
10 , but also beyond that , whatever else happens , " ischinger said in an interview on wednesday .
" this is regardless of whether -lsb- kosovo and serbia -rsb- agree or disagree . " negotiations show no headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger is positive about kosovo 's status being resoved following the latest unsuccessful round of internationally mediated talks between serbian and albanian negotiators held on monday in vienna , ischinger complained that both sides were too focused on their own political agendas . " i believe that it is possible to solve the kosovo issue , " ischinger said . " the question that i ca n't answer is whether both parties - that in the end have come to an agreement - have enough political will to carry out this agreement , " he said . on friday , russia 's president vladimir putin is due to meet with top eu officials at the second of the twice-yearly eu-russia summits .
analysts say that with russian parliamentary elections in december , the summit is unlikely to produce anything concrete on the kosovo problem . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .

10 deadline for the resolution of kosovo 's status looms , the serbian province remains one of the burning questions to be discussed at this week 's russia-nato meeting and the russia-eu summit . nato defense ministers have gathered in the dutch town of noordwijk for a two-day meeting , during which they are expected to pledge to maintain nato 's 16,000 peacekeepers in kosovo at full strength over the coming months . they are to be joined by russia 's defense minister , anatoly serdyukov later on thursday , oct .
25 , when the issue of kosovo is expected to loom large . russia , which holds a veto in the un security council as one of five permanent members , blocked in march the plans of un envoy martti ahtisaari to set kosovo on the road to independence from serbia .
russia said any plan on kosovo 's status needed to backed by both the serbian and kosovo leadership . the predominantly ethnic-albanian serbian province has been under un administration since 1999 .
following russia 's veto , kosovo albanian and serbian officials have been engaged in negotiations , mediated by a troika of envoys from russia , the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians have held numerous protests for independence kosovo albanians leaders have said they will declare independence from serbia unilaterally shortly after these negotiations end on dec .
10 , unless an agreement is met . troika fails to agree with kosovo and serbia failing to make headway in negotiations and the end of the year approaching rapidly , the rift in the troika on how to resolve the issue is becoming more evident . russia has continually expressed its concern that any proclamation of independence by kosovo would serve as a dangerous precedent for other countries - although analysts say that the government is more concerned about the effect on its own minorities in regions such as the caucasus . " i do not see how granting kosovo unilateral independence will stabilize the situation in europe , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya attempted to declare independence from russia in 1991 " it is more likely to cause a chain reaction on the continent and around the world , " he said .
" russia would like to prevent such a scenario knowing that other countries also want the same . " in contrast , the us has repeatedly said that it strongly supports kosovo independence and has signaled it would recognize a unilateral declaration . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said in september : " there 's going to be an independent kosovo , " and that " we 're dedicated to that . " germany wants to wait and see germany refuted media reports on wednesday that the government had agreed to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " there is no decision , " gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman in parliament , told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" rather , we will wait and see what the troika reports ; after all , it has to deliver a report to the united nations . " " also , before making any political decision , we have to see what comes out the -lsb- talks -rsb- in vienna , " weisskirchen added .
" let 's give diplomacy time . " a unified eu ? although the majority of eu countries , like germany , back kosovo 's push for independence , many are reluctant to do this without the support of the un .
however , several countries share russia 's opinion , making eu consensus difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus fears kosovo could set an example romania and slovakia , both fearful that ethnic hungarians could want greater autonomy , have spoken out against an independent kosovo , but have reportedly come under heavy pressure from the us to change their stance . it is more likely to be greece and cyprus that remain the stumbling blocks to an eu agreement . greece , a close ally of serbia , is reportedly concerned that ethnic albanians living in macedonia could similarly push for independence , which would destabilize the situation in their neighboring country .
cyprus , divided between the turkish north and the greek cypriot south , fears the kosovo example might be used by the turkish cypriots . despite this situation , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's envoy for kosovo , told deutsche welle that he believed " the eu will remain unified . " " the chances are very good that the eu can hold together not only until dec .
10 , but also beyond that , whatever else happens , " ischinger said in an interview on wednesday .
" this is regardless of whether -lsb- kosovo and serbia -rsb- agree or disagree . " negotiations show no headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger is positive about kosovo 's status being resoved following the latest unsuccessful round of internationally mediated talks between serbian and albanian negotiators held on monday in vienna , ischinger complained that both sides were too focused on their own political agendas . " i believe that it is possible to solve the kosovo issue , " ischinger said . " the question that i ca n't answer is whether both parties - that in the end have come to an agreement - have enough political will to carry out this agreement , " he said . on friday , russia 's president vladimir putin is due to meet with top eu officials at the second of the twice-yearly eu-russia summits .
analysts say that with russian parliamentary elections in december , the summit is unlikely to produce anything concrete on the kosovo problem . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .
24 .
" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .
6 , would be " objective and fair . " last year 's very critical version led to the freezing of eight of the 35 policy chapters which eu candidate nations must successfully negotiate prior to membership . ankara began talks with the european union in october 2005 , but they have been severely hampered by turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot vessels , which led the eu to suspend negotiations in eight chapters related to trade and the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey refuses to open up its ports and airports to eu member cyprus " -lsb- when -rsb- we are firm we also must be fair , we have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective , " rehn said .
his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption . " portugal , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was also critical of turkey , emphasizing that the government should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code , which makes it a criminal offence to " insult turkishness . "
it was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute nobel prize-winning turkish writer orhan pamuk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey reportedly bombed kurdish targets along the iraq border on wednesday " on freedom of expression , we regret the lack of progress .
we are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship , " said manuel lobo antunes , portugal 's secretary of state for eu affairs . turning to more urgent matters , antunes also urged turkey to think twice before launching military action in northern iraq , following deadly attacks on turkish troops from kurdish rebels in the region . " it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all member states continue to support accession negotiations with turkey , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , oct .

" we should therefore open further chapters -lsb- of talks -rsb- without delay , as soon as they are technically ready . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enlargement olli rehn wants to broaden talks with turkey rehn announced that " at least two chapters could be open in the coming weeks . "
the " chapters " - subjects on which candidate countries have to satisfy eu rules - would most likely be in the fields of consumer and health protection and transport , he said . turkey has managed to open just four accession chapters , only one of which has been satisfactorily completed .
that figure pales next to the 14 chapters opened with croatia , which began its eu talks at the same time as turkey . rehn 's call could spark a row with french president nicolas sarkozy , who has repeatedly suggestion that largely muslim turkey does not culturally belong in the european union . sarkozy repeated his opinion last week during an eu meeting in lisbon that the eu should not open any new accession negotiation chapters with turkey until a committee of " wise men , " who would think about the future role and borders of the eu , is put in place . new turkey report rehn indicated that his annual report on turkey 's progress towards the eu , to be delivered on nov .

his change of tone follows a popular vote in turkey on sunday which approved sweeping constitutional reforms . the reforms provide for the head of state to be elected by popular suffrage for a once-renewable five-year term , instead of being chosen by parliament for a single seven-year mandate . it also sets legislative elections for every four years instead of the current five . " the -lsb- european -rsb- commission welcomes the fact that the government has put the constitutional reform at the top of its agenda with a view to improving democracy and expanding individual freedoms , " rehn said . turkey needs to do more however , he warned that " further efforts " were needed " to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations , protect the rights of women , children and trade unions , improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption .

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .

delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .

however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .

24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .

after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .

"
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .

after 43 days in captivity , schleyer was murdered following the german government 's refusal to give in to raf demands for the release of 11 of baader-meinhof gang 's members . " from today 's perspective , " the kidnapping was justified , wagner had told the newspaper junge welt .
others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions . " wagner , who spent 24 years in prison for his role in the schleyer kidnapping , was released in 2003 after a presidential pardon . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.10.2007 eu 's weakened co2 target angers environmentalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament says it is giving the car industry more time to adapt the fight against pollution and climate change was hit hard by the european parliament 's decision to cut the reduction targets for vehicle carbon-dioxide emissions , the gas most linked to global warning . environmental groups reacted with fury to the vote on wednesday , oct .
24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .
prosecutors refused to comment on how garweg was identified . staub , klette and garweg belong to the so-called third generation raf , which committed 20 violent crimes and assassinations between 1984 and 1993 , resulting in 10 deaths and 29 people being seriously injured . commemoration service on tuesday , the relatives of germans slain by raf held a commemoration service on the 30th anniversary of the murder of prominent industrial leader , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of raf bombers hang on the walls at the commemeration service speaking at the commemoration held at germany 's historical museum in berlin , justice minister brigitte zypries said the event was the first to remember all the victims of the terrorist group killed by the raf . in reference to the widespread public support the terrorists had at times enjoyed , zypries said the victims had often been seen by germans " through the eyes of their killers . "
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .

others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.10.2007 eu 's weakened co2 target angers environmentalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament says it is giving the car industry more time to adapt the fight against pollution and climate change was hit hard by the european parliament 's decision to cut the reduction targets for vehicle carbon-dioxide emissions , the gas most linked to global warning . environmental groups reacted with fury to the vote on wednesday , oct .
24 , which backed a target of 125 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2015 .
current european targets , established in 1994 , mandate that total emissions across the eu should not exceed an average of 120 per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- per car by 2012 .
earlier this year , the european commission - the eu 's executive - suggested that the target should be raised to 130 grams by 2012 .
the european parliament 's environmental committee countered by proposing that the limit should remain at the " 120 by 2012 " level .
but on wednesday , the full session of parliament backed the weakened suggestion of 125 grams , arguing that the new target would give automobile manufacturers time to adapt .
however , the decision effectively reduces annual reduction targets by an estimated 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars will pump out more co2 than originally agreed " making cars more fuel efficient is one of the most important steps europe can take to cut emissions , reduce oil dependency and cut fuel costs , yet meps -lsb- members of the european parliament -rsb- seem to have lost their nerve , " aat peterse of environmental think-tank transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- told reporters after the vote .
" this result is a massive setback for overall eu climate policy ...
meps have voted to put the brakes on the eu 's attempts to tackle climate change , " leading green mep rebecca harms added .
delay for auto industry dismissed by environmentalists the argument for giving the automotive industry more time to adapt its models to the eu target got short shrift from environmentalists .
" the 120 target was first announced in 1994 - that 's 13 years or at least two complete vehicle development cycles .
the technology has already been developed , carmakers wo n't start using it to its full potential until the regulation comes in , that 's why a further delay is incomprehensible , " t & e spokesman dudley curtis said .
but liberal and conservative meps backed the move , saying that it showed a " realistic " appreciation of the challenges facing industry .
supporters say climate fight must not affect economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economies should be protected , say supporters " ambitious carbon-dioxide reductions are necessary for the eu to make its contribution to the fight against climate change .
however , they should not harm the european , and particularly the german economy , but should be an incentive to technological leadership , " said german mep karl-heinz florenz , a christian democrat .
" whoever demands politically tight limits and more efficient cars should consider the industry 's development and production cycles over five to seven years , " added mep holger krahmer a member of germany 's free market liberal fdp .
" sports and all-terrain cars produce more carbon dioxide than average , but there are so few of them on the roads that their contribution to total emissions is minimal . "
the proposal agreed on by the european parliament must now go to the council of eu member states for further consideration .
the european commission will then produce a proposal for eu-wide legislation on the issue , based on , but not necessarily dictated by , the opinions of parliament and the council .
the decision may be seen as dealing a substantial blow to the eu 's efforts to curb global warming , but it could be even more damaging to the climate change campaign championed by german chancellor angela merkel .
merkel 's climate crusade hit on eu , domestic level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " very nice ... but will it comply with my climate plan ? "
during germany 's dual presidencies of the european union and g8 , merkel put environmental policies at the top of her agenda .
despite relinquishing the eu reins in july , merkel has continued to campaign on green issues around the world .
many of the policies being debated on the eu environmental agenda were put there during the german presidency .
consequently , those which are being diluted and thrown out are policies merkel battled to get there in the first place , including the co2 emissions target .
merkel 's climate crusade is not only being undermined on the european front but also domestically , with ministers constantly fighting over the cost and viability of the " integrated energy and climate program , " the framework merkel wants to establish to implement her ambitious goals .
cabinet members disagree on almost every element of the project that the chancellor wants established to make germany a world leader in cutting co2 levels .
the eu decision on car emissions is unlikely to ease the pressure at home . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .

new information reveals three of the perpetrators have been identified , but their whereabouts are still unknown . in 1993 , the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof group after two of its founders , planted a bomb in the newly built prison of weiterstadt in the state of hesse .
after climbing over a six-meter -lrb- 20-foot -rrb- wall on a rope ladder and subduing guards with machine guns , the perpetrators laid some 200 kilograms -lrb- 440 pounds -rrb- of explosives , causing 65 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- worth of damages . the weiterstadt bombing was the raf 's last act before they officially disbanded in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf was responsible for car bombings , shootings and hijakings according to the weekly stern magazine , dna samples identified at least two suspects involved in the bombing , but this information was withheld by prosecutors and has only now come to light . germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on tuesday stern 's report that the two are daniela klette and ernst-volker staub , who have been on the run from authorities since the late 1980s . whereabouts unknown in 1999 , more than a year after the raf had broken up , the two were involved in a spectacular robbery of am armored car , netting more than one million german marks -lrb- 510,000 euros -rrb- .
they left masks at the scene of the crime , enabling police to identify them from dna traces taken from traces of saliva , but have not been sighted since . in addition , police are seeking a third weiterstadt bombing suspect - burkhard garweg .

"
a 1971 poll showed that one in four west germans under the age of 30 had some sympathy for the group , but approval dwindled as violence escalated . only recently had the focus fallen on the victims themselves " as spouse , father , son and as friend , " zypries said .
the justice minister also criticized as " scandalous and unacceptable " former terrorists who had attempted to justify their acts . the raf targeted and killed bankers , business titans , jurists , bureaucrats and policemen in a campaign of " armed struggle " aimed at revealing a fascist core beneath west germany 's democratic institutions . the names of 37 victims were read out by school pupils at the commemoration in the german historical museum .

others have justified schleyer 's abduction and murder of on the grounds of his membership of the nazi party and ss during world war ii . a spokeswoman for the berlin prosecutor 's office said it was looking into whether wagner 's remarks constituted the offence of " endorsing criminal actions . " wagner , who spent 24 years in prison for his role in the schleyer kidnapping , was released in 2003 after a presidential pardon . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all three german participants are battling to qualify for the knock-out phase . germany 's champions league representatives are still struggling to get a handle on europe 's premier club competition this year , with werder bremen , schalke 04 and bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart offering woeful group stage performances .
bremen , after suffering back-to-back defeats at real madrid and home to olympiakos , gave themselves a faint lifeline on wednesday , oct .
24 , however , when they sealed an impressive 2-1 win at home to injury-hit italian side lazio .
a first-half goal by bremen 's ivory coast striker boubacar sanogo calmed the nerves before his portuguese striking partner hugo almeida sealed the win with a second-half strike , before the italians grabbed a late consolation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boubacar sanogo gets bremen off the mark " we were definitely the better team , " said bremen 's injured midfielder tim borowski .
" unfortunately , we relaxed a bit too much at the end , but we held on for the win and we have to build on this now to keep our champions league hopes alive . "
this was the italians first defeat in group c after draws against the greek and spanish champions as bremen leap-frogged them into third place .
real top the group after a 4-2 win over olympiakos in madrid on wednesday night , which puts the greeks second .
schalke 04 lose again in london schalke 's chances of progressing out of the group stage and into the knock-out phase took another blow when they went down 2-0 to chelsea in london .
chelsea were gifted the lead when schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer let florent malouda 's shot trickle through his legs before didier drogba scored with a second half header at stamford bridge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's drogba seals the win with the second goal schalke coach mirko slomka felt drogba 's goal killed off his side .
" the goals came at bad moments and that affected our motivation .
the second goal was a bitter blow but there may have been a question of it being offside , " he said .
" we were unfortunate to hit the post but overall chelsea were able to cope with everything we offered . "
the german club 's preparations were hit by kevin kuranyi 's late withdrawal through injury and slomka 's side never really recovered from the loss of their star striker .
schalke are currently bottom of group b on goal difference but are equal on points with valencia and only one behind rosenberg of norway .
schalke have lost to both chelsea and valencia but the victory over the norwegian champions gives them a slight hope of creeping up into the qualification places with three games to go .
german champions crash to third defeat stuttgart 's participation in the champions league looks to be going no further than group e after the bundesliga champions suffered their third straight defeat in europe at the hands of lyon on tuesday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's karim benzema heaps more misery on vfb a deflected strike by fabio dos santos and a goal by karim benzema were enough to give the stuttering french champions the win , their first in this season 's competition .
the result left stuttgart firmly rooted to the bottom of the group , their winless performance mirroring that of their domestic form - they lie fifth from bottom of the bundesliga with just 10 points from 10 games , the worst start to a season in history for the defending champions .
stuttgart coach armin veh could have no complaints with the result .
" at the end of the day , we did n't have many chances , unlike lyon , " he said .
" we should have at least held on for a draw but lyon scored and then made the most of the situation . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2007 sarkozy promises green revolution for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a little support from prominent friends - sarkozy with gore president sarkozy has unveiled a raft of tax measures and investment pledges , saying they will revolutionize france 's environmental policy and put the country at the forefront of the fight against global warming . speaking at the end of a two-day , high-profile national environment conference at the elysee palace attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and european commission head jose manuel barroso , sarkozy called for an " ecological new deal " to push france toward the vanguard of the battle against global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illustrious green circle - sarkozy and barosso with kenya 's wangar maathai and al gore " france has n't fallen behind , but it wants now to be in the lead , " sarkozy said at the end of the special environmental policy meeting seeking ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and help change attitudes to the environment in society .
" the time for action has come .
we have waited too long ; we can not wait any longer , " he said . " france wants to be ahead , and it wants to be exemplary . "
cutting road traffic outlining the measures , sarkozy said he was in favor of a moratorium on all new highways and airports as well as shifting trucks off highways and onto railroads . road transport accounts for a quarter of french emissions . earlier , jean-louis borloo also announced a freeze on the building of new roads and airports while consumers will be steered away from gas-guzzling cars through bonuses and penalties .
sarkozy also wants to extend france 's tram and high-speed tgv train network .
other plans include a nationwide campaign to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings .
single pane glass and energy wasting lightbulbs would be banned .
the goal is to have 20 percent energy savings by 2010 .
by 2020 , all new buildings should " produce more energy than they consume , " sarkozy said , without specifying how this would be accomplished .
france a latecomer to green causes france is widely seen to be lagging behind neighboring germany and scandinavian countries in promoting environmental innovation and the high-profile national environmental conference was aimed at giving the message that france intends to play catch-up .
greenpeace estimates that france needs to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures are meant to change the way the french eat , travel and live the conference was also meant to fulfill sarkozy 's election campaign promise that his government would emphasize sustainable development .
it marked the climax of three months of nationwide discussions with employers , unions and environmental groups meant to produce 15 to 20 measures changing the way the french eat , travel and live .
controversial measures dropped sarkozy steered clear of a generalized " carbon tax " that environmentalists wanted and instead unveiled a raft of measures aimed at punishing polluting vehicles .
drivers who buy cars that use little gasoline will be entitled to discounts , while those who buy gas-guzzlers will have to pay extra , according to another measure .
environmentalists ' demand for an eco tax was also dropped . the french president said he would only consider such a tax if the costs to the taxpayer could be mitigated by a reduction in social security contributions sarkozy also scrapped controversial plans to lower the speed limit on highways and add a fuel tax for domestic flights .
many agricultural reforms too were watered down under pressure from farming unions and the strong agricultural lobby .
sarkozy said he would suspend the planting of genetically modified -lrb- gmo -rrb- pest-resistant crops until the results of an appraisal of the issue later this year or early in 2008 .
the government also said it will ban 47 highly toxic pesticides .
environmentalists wanted the frequency of pesticide treatments cut in half but sarkozy set no deadline for that proposal .
beyond specific proposals , sarkozy pledged that all state projects will be examined in terms of their " climate costs , " sarkozy said .
" we can no longer consider any political project without thinking about the challenge of climate change , " he said .
while sarkozy promised that the paris eco-summit would lead to " a revolution in our behavior , in our policies , " he promised to do so without increasing the cost of living .
sarkozy sticks to nuclear power sarkozy committed the government to investing 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- over four years in alternative fuels and engine innovations .
organic food also got a nod of support .
france is europe 's biggest agricultural producer .
a proposal would increase the share of organic crops from two percent to 20 percent by 2020 .
furthermore , 20 percent of school meals would be organic , he said .
france 's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared with other european economies because of the country 's reliance on nuclear power , which accounts for more than 80 percent of electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has pledged to maintain france 's nuclear energy capacity sarkozy promised not to build any more nuclear power reactors , but said that france could not " give up this form of energy . "
" we must improve our energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020 , " he said .
" our sole pertinent aim is to reduce our dependency on carbon . "
gore called sarkozy " a great friend of the people of this planet because you are providing leadership . "
" we must realize that increases in global warming pollution anywhere now threaten the viability of human civilization everywhere , " he said .
french lawmakers are expected to vote on sarkozy 's proposals early next year .
since the french parliament is dominated by sarkozy 's party , the initiatives are likely to pass .
activists fear lawmakers will try to back away from some of sarkozy 's more controversial measures . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters that proposals by the united states aimed at resolving the row had not allayed moscow 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov said that russia had differences with nato " all that has been proposed to us does not satisfy us , our position remains the same , " the itar-tass and interfax news agency quoted serdyukov as saying .
he added however that washington was " beginning to better understand our concerns . "
" us missile defence proposals are unacceptable and do not suit russia , " serdyukov said .
serdyukov said russia 's objections concerned both missile defense and the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty , a key arms pact from which moscow has threatened to withdraw .
" in russia 's relations with nato there are several issues on which we have not found common positions .
this above all concerns the cfe treaty and missile defense , " he was quoted by interfax as saying .
us offer of russian presence at missile site rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gates had his offer dismissed by the russians the comments came after us defense secretary robert gates on tuesday outlined proposals to let " a russian presence " monitor a missile defense radar facility that washington hopes to build in the czech republic .
the radar is part of a proposed missile defense system that would also comprise a small number of interceptor missiles in poland .
washington insists that the proposed system is not directed against russia but against " rogue states , " notably iran .
but russia has insisted the us plans threaten its security .
serdyukov on thursday added that the russian threat to withdraw from the cfe treaty " is stimulating nato countries to take a decision as soon as possible " on a russian demand for ratification of an updated version of the treaty .
nato chief warns russia of withdrawing from cfe addressing reporters at the nato meeting in noordwijk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said a russian withdrawal from the cfe would be " deplorable " .
" i sincerely hope it will not happen .
nato considers this treaty one of the cornerstones , if not the cornerstone , of european security , " he said .
" the allies and i would deplore very much if the russian federation were to decide to suspend or leave the treaty , " he added .
de hoop scheffer said russia and the us were engaged in " constructive talks " and urged all parties involved not to close the door to negotiation .
" please do n't make irreversible moves , do n't do irreversible steps .
give this process a chance , " he said .
scheffer added : " while process has now taken off , i would deplore if the russian federation would decide to suspend . "
nato countries have said they would only ratify a revised version of the cfe treaty once moscow has lived up to a pledge made in 1999 to pull its troops out of former soviet republics georgia and moldova .
nato scrapes together fresh troops for afghanistan at the same meeting , nato defense ministers however managed to scrape together fresh troops for afghanistan despite reluctance on the part of countries such as germany to deploy peacekeepers to the more volatile parts of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led peacekeeping force is looking for reinforcements the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has faced stiff resistance from taliban-led insurgents in the south and east of afghanistan and has called on its allies for help . germany has often come under the spotlight for resisting moves , for which it would need parliamentary approval , to redeploy away from the relatively stable north of the country and play a greater combat role .
officials declined to speak on the record about which countries had made offers as those pledges must be confirmed at a so-called " force generation conference " in belgium next month .
but news agency afp quoted an alliance diplomat saying that nine nations had come forward . one senior official said that non-nato nations albania , croatia and georgia were among them , as well as member country slovakia , the agency said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

national museum wales officials want the site to tell the story of wales from its earliest times , and not just from the middle ages on .
they want some funding for the project , which will cost between £ 6m and £ 8.5m , to come from the assembly government .
a national museum wales report shows visitor figures increased last year .
michael houlihan , director general of the national museum wales , said oriel 1 , a new gallery which opened in march , was the " first step " towards transforming st fagans . "
nations and peoples have a fundamental need to honour the past , their stories and individual memories .
without them , there can be no sense of identity " michael houlihan , national museum wales museum officials consulted 5,000 organisations and individuals to help them decide the future of st fagans , which attracts about 700,000 visitors annually .
the museum currently illustrates and interprets life in wales from the middle ages to the present day .
but under the new plans , older works will be moved to the site from the national museum cardiff .
officials say they aim to fulfil the expectations of visitors who want to learn more about the roots of wales and its diversity .
mr houlihan added : " nations and peoples have a fundamental need to honour the past , their stories and individual memories .
without them , there can be no sense of identity . "
funding for the st fagans project will be sought from commercial sponsorship , grant-awarding bodies and private individuals , as well as from the assembly government .
the project is expected to take around 10 years .
the st fagans development will be announced at the launch of national museums wales ' annual report , which details the performance of all of wales ' seven national museums .
culture minister rhodri glyn thomas , who will be hosting the launch of the report , said he was looking forward to seeing the developments over the next decade .
the report claims visitor figures for all seven national museums in wales have risen above 1.5m for the first time .
this success has been attributed to the national waterfront museum in swansea .
the seven national museums in wales are : st fagans : national history museum ; national roman legion museum , caerleon ; big pit : national coal museum , blaenafon ; national wool museum , dre-fach felindre ; national slate museum , llanberis ; the national waterfront museum , swansea , and the national museum cardiff .

after they found virtually no-one agreed , they raised the idea of research into people 's perceptions of north and south to an expert in human mapping at the university of sheffield .
professor danny dorling and his team threw a series of statistical , social , cultural and economic factors at the problem .
they included variants in house prices , visual changes in the built environment , physical and historic boundaries , cultural and political differences and different life expectancy rates .

professor dorling also found the dividing line between north and south shifted depending on social and economic factors .
his team also claimed there was very little middle ground - or social midlands , if you were - between the south and the north .
bill longshaw , curator of myth of the north , said : " i 'm not sure i agree that culturally people in parts of gloucester , coventry or birmingham are really northerners but danny 's analysis really does make you think about where the north begins .
" but no one who has visited the exhibition seems to be able to agree where the boundary is either , so at least this exercise has brought some academic and scientific reason to the debate . "

china 's economy grew at an annual pace of 11.5 % in the three months to the end of september , official figures show .
the figure was ahead of economists ' predictions but slightly slower than the 11.9 % seen in the previous quarter .
china will soon overtake germany to become the world 's third-largest economy behind the us and japan .
beijing said the slowing growth was evidence that efforts to cool the supercharged economy were having the desired effect .
" due to macro-economic controls , we have turned the economy from being an over-heating one to being one of speedy growth , " said national bureau of statistics spokesman , li xiaochao .
among its efforts to curb the pace of growth have been five interest rate increases in 2007 and limits on spending on factories and property .
there has also been a ban on building luxury villas and an upping of taxes on the export of steel and other energy-intensive products .
uncertain outlook exports and construction have driven china 's economy forward .
beijing is trying to encourage chinese consumers to spend more , and reduce the nation 's reliance on exports .
mr li said that problems in the us credit market were unlikely to affect chinese growth , but added that rising oil prices and the possibility of a global slowdown may hit the economy in the coming year .
separate data showed that consumer prices in september were 6.2 % higher than a year before - blamed largely on a shortage of pork and other food .

in some cases , pollution is said to be more than three times the safe limits set by the world health organization .

international olympic committee president jacques rogge said events may be postponed if pollution was too bad .

in some cases , pollution is said to be more than three times the safe limits set by the world health organization .
the report seems to contradict claims from beijing olympic officials that air quality will not be a problem .
international olympic committee president jacques rogge said events may be postponed if pollution was too bad .
' legitimate concern ' the report , written by the un environment programme , reviews beijing 's environmental commitments related to next year 's olympics .
while unep officials praise the chinese government for achievements already made , they say air pollution remains a " legitimate concern " .
relevant progress may be evident only in the medium to long term un report the 163-page report states that , between 2000 and 2006 , the chinese authorities reduced the concentration of some key air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide .
but that downward trend came to a halt in 2006 when the levels of four major pollutants rose or ceased to decline , it adds .
the report also has grim findings about the concentration of particulate matter , which comes from construction sites , coal-burning boilers and dust storms .
this pollutant is at about the same concentration level as it was in 2000 , and at certain periods is three times above the who safe limit .
unep spokesman eric falt said olympic organisers , athletes , spectators and beijing residents had a right to be worried .
but he refused to spell out more clearly exactly what the unep figures mean for next year 's olympics .
" we have said it has been a concern for a long time , but i do not want to go beyond what has been said , " he told the bbc .
but it seems clear from the report that air pollution will not significantly improve before the olympics begins next august .
" it may take years to determine significant changes in air quality .
relevant progress may be evident only in the medium to long term , " the report says .
this point was reinforced by mr falt , who said only long-term planning and proper enforcement could solve the problem .
the unep report seems to contradict comments made by beijing officials .
du shaozhong , beijing 's head of environmental protection , said in august : " i am sure we will be able to ensure good air quality during the olympic games . "

dr ere shesiah 's findings prompted a global murder inquiry and speculation about corruption and match-fixing .
but the inquiry was dropped after three independent experts said mr woolmer died of natural causes .
mr woolmer , 58 , died after being found unconscious in his hotel room in march , after his team 's early world cup exit .
dr shesiah was speaking on wednesday at the former coach 's inquest , which opened in jamaica nine days ago .
he is expected to give further evidence on thursday .
' strangled and poisoned ' he said his conclusion was based on his own initial findings and the results of a toxicology report .
" i stand by my findings that mr woolmer was strangled and , based upon additional information which i received , he was also poisoned , " he said .
the pathologist added that police had rushed him to make a final judgement before the report came back , and that he only received it in june - after the murder inquiry was dropped .
he said the poison used was cypermethrin which caused " salivation , vomiting , diarrhoea and muscular incoordination " and that this may have explained the disarray in woolmer 's room when he was found .
three other pathologists , from south africa , the uk and canada , have testified woolmer died of natural causes , probably related to heart disease .
they also criticised procedures used by dr shesiah .
he says he used the correct methods to carry out the post-mortem .
mr woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel in jamaica on 18 march after pakistan were beaten in the cricket world cup first round by ireland .
he was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead .
days after the discovery of mr woolmer 's body , mark shields - jamaica 's deputy police commissioner - announced at a news conference they were treating the death as murder .
there were suggestions he had been murdered by an angry fan or by an illegal betting syndicate .
there was also speculation members of the pakistan team may have been involved .
every member of the team was fingerprinted before returning home , but the investigation found no evidence of impropriety by players , match officials or management .
in june , jamaican police said they accepted the three pathologists ' reports concluding that the original finding of death by manual asphyxiation was wrong .

the british medical association in wales wants the formula for public expenditure in wales to be reviewed .
the assembly 's £ 40m running cost , without civil servant costs , comes from the grant paying for public services .
but first minister rhodri morgan said the issue was determined in the 1997 referendum which set up the assembly .
bma cymru claimed the money for the assembly 's day-to-day costs was being " siphoned off " from the £ 14bn the assembly received from the uk government to run public services in wales .
it urged a review of the barnett formula - which determines the overall amount of public expenditure in wales - so that all the money that came to wales was spent on front line services like the nhs .
the assembly 's £ 40m running costs equate to 0.29 % of its overall budget and 0.9 % of the £ 4.4bn health budget .
running costs of institutions uk parliament £ 450m scottish parliament £ 70m welsh assembly £ 40m parliament in westminster costs around £ 450m a year to run .
this is separate from the budgets for the health and education services in england .
david samuel , vice-chair of the bma 's welsh medical students committee , said : " we feel it 's far more beneficial to the people of wales if we 've already paid for the assembly through central funding , so all the money provided to wales can be for the benefit of patients .
" we accept that devolution does come with its costs .
but we also feel now that now the assembly is well established we should actually be pushing for central government to fund some of these things .
bma cymru says the assembly 's costs are ' siphoned ' from the nhs " by having separate funding , we 'll know exactly how much money is available to the people of wales , we 'll know exactly how much is available for health and then we can plan our services far better .
" every penny counts and every pound counts .
at the moment , the health services in wales are so far stretched that any additional funding must be a positive thing . "
mr morgan said the issue was determined in the referendum and general election of 1997 .
he said : " if it 's only become clear now to the bma , that shows that somebody in the bma should have been around in 1997 and should have been reading , not the fine print , it was in very large letters .
" we would get a lot of benefits from it , through having local democracy .
" what we ca n't have is asking the english parliament , as it were , or the parliament for the uk , but in its english function , to be paying for the establishment costs of the assembly . "

the british medical association in wales wants the formula for public expenditure in wales to be reviewed .
the assembly 's £ 40m running cost , without civil servant costs , comes from the grant paying for public services .
but first minister rhodri morgan said the issue was determined in the 1997 referendum which set up the assembly .
bma cymru claimed the money for the assembly 's day-to-day costs was being " siphoned off " from the £ 14bn the assembly received from the uk government to run public services in wales .
it urged a review of the barnett formula - which determines the overall amount of public expenditure in wales - so that all the money that came to wales was spent on front line services like the nhs .
the assembly 's £ 40m running costs equate to 0.29 % of its overall budget and 0.9 % of the £ 4.4bn health budget .
running costs of institutions uk parliament £ 450m scottish parliament £ 70m welsh assembly £ 40m parliament in westminster costs around £ 450m a year to run .
this is separate from the budgets for the health and education services in england .
david samuel , vice-chair of the bma 's welsh medical students committee , said : " we feel it 's far more beneficial to the people of wales if we 've already paid for the assembly through central funding , so all the money provided to wales can be for the benefit of patients .
" we accept that devolution does come with its costs .
but we also feel now that now the assembly is well established we should actually be pushing for central government to fund some of these things .
bma cymru says the assembly 's costs are ' siphoned ' from the nhs " by having separate funding , we 'll know exactly how much money is available to the people of wales , we 'll know exactly how much is available for health and then we can plan our services far better .
" every penny counts and every pound counts .
at the moment , the health services in wales are so far stretched that any additional funding must be a positive thing . "
mr morgan said the issue was determined in the referendum and general election of 1997 .
he said : " if it 's only become clear now to the bma , that shows that somebody in the bma should have been around in 1997 and should have been reading , not the fine print , it was in very large letters .
" we would get a lot of benefits from it , through having local democracy .
" what we ca n't have is asking the english parliament , as it were , or the parliament for the uk , but in its english function , to be paying for the establishment costs of the assembly . "

shell 's earnings - measured by current cost of supply - fell 8 % from a year earlier to $ 6.4bn -lrb- £ 3.1bn -rrb- , down from $ 6.9bn.
despite the loss , the results still beat analysts ' downbeat forecasts of $ 5.6bn , helped by the oil price setting a series of record highs recently .
earlier this week , uk rival bp saw third-quarter profits slump 45 % .
shell said crude oil production in its third-quarter period was down 9 % compared with a year ago , partly as a result of the firm selling its majority stake in the sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to russia 's gazprom earlier this year .
higher production costs also ate into shell 's earnings , but the firm blamed this on industry-wide problems .
shell chief executive jeroen van der veer said the results were " satisfactory " , given the weaker refining margins .
he added : " we continue to rejuvenate our portfolio with sustained investment in new legacy assets , and through disposals .
the execution of our strategy is on track . "
new projects some of shell 's projects that have come on stream over the past three months include the ormen lange field in norway , which the firm says will eventually provide 20 % of all the uk 's gas needs , and the deimos field in the gulf of mexico .
the anglo-dutch oil major said it had also invested in expanding its port arthur refinery in texas , which it hopes will become the largest refinery in the us .
shell 's results are in stark contrast to bp 's recent performance , which has been blighted by shutdowns at its core refineries , slower production at its north sea operations and safety problems .
on wednesday , bp said 350 jobs would go at its north sea headquarters in aberdeen , as part of a tough restructuring programme designed to get the struggling firm back on track under new boss tony hayward .

demand for the console has outstripped that for sony 's playstation 3 and microsoft 's xbox 360 - selling about 7.3 million units .
the japanese firm made a net profit of 132.4bn yen -lrb- $ 1.16bn ; £ 506m -rrb- from 54.4bn yen a year earlier .
popularity of the handheld ds also helped , with nintendo selling about 13.4 million of the consoles .
the ds console , which allows users to control play with a stylus , has proved popular with women and older users .
meanwhile the motion sensitive wii has proved popular after introducing a new way of playing computer games .
supply difficulties earlier this week , nintendo 's wii sports swept the board at the 2007 british academy video games awards in london .
the games package won awards in categories such as gameplay , strategy and simulation , innovation and sports .
the game allows players to compete in onscreen sporting events using the wii 's controller as a tennis racquet , golf club or even a bowling ball .
nintendo has upped the number of wii consoles it expects to sell in the year to march from 16.5 million to 17.5 million .
demand has been so high that the japanese firm has had supply difficulties .
it is thought that it will take another year before the firm can ramp up production to meet demand .
separately , sony , which has cut the price of its playstation 3 to try to win back sales in the run-up to christmas , said that strong sales of televisions and cameras had offset losses in its video games division during the july-to-september quarter .
the company made a net profit of 73.7bn yen in the period against just 1.7bn yen in the same period a year ago , when it was dogged by hefty costs related to recalling computer batteries .

shell 's earnings - measured by current cost of supply - fell 8 % from a year earlier to $ 6.4bn -lrb- £ 3.1bn -rrb- , down from $ 6.9bn.
despite the loss , the results still beat analysts ' downbeat forecasts of $ 5.6bn , helped by the oil price setting a series of record highs recently .
earlier this week , uk rival bp saw third-quarter profits slump 45 % .
shell said crude oil production in its third-quarter period was down 9 % compared with a year ago , partly as a result of the firm selling its majority stake in the sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to russia 's gazprom earlier this year .
higher production costs also ate into shell 's earnings , but the firm blamed this on industry-wide problems .
shell chief executive jeroen van der veer said the results were " satisfactory " , given the weaker refining margins .
he added : " we continue to rejuvenate our portfolio with sustained investment in new legacy assets , and through disposals .
the execution of our strategy is on track . "
new projects some of shell 's projects that have come on stream over the past three months include the ormen lange field in norway , which the firm says will eventually provide 20 % of all the uk 's gas needs , and the deimos field in the gulf of mexico .
the anglo-dutch oil major said it had also invested in expanding its port arthur refinery in texas , which it hopes will become the largest refinery in the us .
shell 's results are in stark contrast to bp 's recent performance , which has been blighted by shutdowns at its core refineries , slower production at its north sea operations and safety problems .
on wednesday , bp said 350 jobs would go at its north sea headquarters in aberdeen , as part of a tough restructuring programme designed to get the struggling firm back on track under new boss tony hayward .

shell said crude oil production in its third-quarter period was down 9 % compared with a year ago , partly as a result of the firm selling its majority stake in the sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to russia 's gazprom earlier this year .
higher production costs also ate into shell 's earnings , but the firm blamed this on industry-wide problems .
shell chief executive jeroen van der veer said the results were " satisfactory " , given the weaker refining margins .
he added : " we continue to rejuvenate our portfolio with sustained investment in new legacy assets , and through disposals .
the execution of our strategy is on track . "
new projects some of shell 's projects that have come on stream over the past three months include the ormen lange field in norway , which the firm says will eventually provide 20 % of all the uk 's gas needs , and the deimos field in the gulf of mexico .
the anglo-dutch oil major said it had also invested in expanding its port arthur refinery in texas , which it hopes will become the largest refinery in the us .
shell 's results are in stark contrast to bp 's recent performance , which has been blighted by shutdowns at its core refineries , slower production at its north sea operations and safety problems .
on wednesday , bp said 350 jobs would go at its north sea headquarters in aberdeen , as part of a tough restructuring programme designed to get the struggling firm back on track under new boss tony hayward .

demand for the console has outstripped that for sony 's playstation 3 and microsoft 's xbox 360 - selling about 7.3 million units .
the japanese firm made a net profit of 132.4bn yen -lrb- $ 1.16bn ; £ 506m -rrb- from 54.4bn yen a year earlier .
popularity of the handheld ds also helped , with nintendo selling about 13.4 million of the consoles .
the ds console , which allows users to control play with a stylus , has proved popular with women and older users .
meanwhile the motion sensitive wii has proved popular after introducing a new way of playing computer games .
supply difficulties earlier this week , nintendo 's wii sports swept the board at the 2007 british academy video games awards in london .
the games package won awards in categories such as gameplay , strategy and simulation , innovation and sports .
the game allows players to compete in onscreen sporting events using the wii 's controller as a tennis racquet , golf club or even a bowling ball .
nintendo has upped the number of wii consoles it expects to sell in the year to march from 16.5 million to 17.5 million .
demand has been so high that the japanese firm has had supply difficulties .
it is thought that it will take another year before the firm can ramp up production to meet demand .
separately , sony , which has cut the price of its playstation 3 to try to win back sales in the run-up to christmas , said that strong sales of televisions and cameras had offset losses in its video games division during the july-to-september quarter .
the company made a net profit of 73.7bn yen in the period against just 1.7bn yen in the same period a year ago , when it was dogged by hefty costs related to recalling computer batteries .

when the relief ends in april 2008 , entrepreneurs will have to pay 18 % tax , instead of the current 10 % when they sell all or part of their company .
mr green said the government should instead have introduced a tax-free ceiling of up to £ 1m for new firms .
his comments came as his arcadia group reported a 2 % dip in annual profits .
' better way ' " i think there is probably a better way to get there -lsb- on cgt -rsb- , " mr green told the bbc 's wake up to money programme . "
after the pretty unseasonable weather , i think we came out of it rather well " philip green " there should be a ceiling for people starting up companies , of , say , £ 500,000 to £ 1m .
" you need to give people an incentive to bet their own house or use their own money -lsb- to set up a company -rsb- . "
arcadia , the uk 's largest clothing retailer , made a pre-tax profit of £ 199m in the 12 months to 1 september , down from £ 202m a year earlier .
the company 's fashion chains include topshop , burton , miss selfridge , and dorothy perkins .
same-store sales were up 2.1 % .
no dividend despite the slight dip in profits , mr green said he was pleased with the results following the " washout " summer .
" after the pretty unseasonable weather , i think we came out of it rather well , " he told the bbc 's today programme .
yet mr green added that for the second year running , he would not be paying himself a dividend .
for the year to september 2005 , he and his family pocketed a dividend of £ 1.2bn from arcadia .
