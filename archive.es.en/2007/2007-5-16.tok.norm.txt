more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wolfowitz have to leave the wolrd bank headquarters in washington , d.c. ?
" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .

" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .

" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .
in the meantime , as europe awaits this high-technology navigation projects , a separate egnos system will enter operation by 2008 , improving the quality of gps signals to pinpoint a location within five meters . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .

his first political task is to appoint a caretaker government to lead the ruling ump into parliamentary elections on june 10 and 17 .
on thursday , sarkozy is expected to name former social affairs minister francois fillon , 53 , as prime minister .

on leaving the elysee , chirac and his wife bernadette were taken to their new temporary home in an apartment on the seine river overlooking the louvre museum .
the flat has been loaned by the family of assassinated former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , who was a close friend of the chiracs .

chirac 's presidential immunity expires on june 16 , and judicial officials have told afp it is " most probable " he will be interviewed as a witness in a probe into a kickback scheme for paying party workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .

" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .

" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

a 21-gun salute rang out as the official results of sarkozy 's election victory were read out to an audience of invited guests in the palace 's ornate main reception hall .
" the people have given me a mandate , " france 's new right-wing president said in a 10-minute televised address .
" i will carry it out .
i will carry it out scrupulously , with the desire to be worthy of the trust that the french have placed in me . "
" i will defend the independence of france , i will defend the identity of france .

he then flew to berlin for a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel , where the future of the european union was the main issue for discussion .

his first political task is to appoint a caretaker government to lead the ruling ump into parliamentary elections on june 10 and 17 .

on leaving the elysee , chirac and his wife bernadette were taken to their new temporary home in an apartment on the seine river overlooking the louvre museum .

authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .

60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .

the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .
in the meantime , as europe awaits this high-technology navigation projects , a separate egnos system will enter operation by 2008 , improving the quality of gps signals to pinpoint a location within five meters . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .

" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 16.05.2007 eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu feels that no further delays in the galileo project should be permitted the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors . the commission complained that the technical complexity of the project , the time and costs to build it and obstacles posed by the private builders had all been underestimated and that no further delays could be permitted .
the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .
in the meantime , as europe awaits this high-technology navigation projects , a separate egnos system will enter operation by 2008 , improving the quality of gps signals to pinpoint a location within five meters . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .
-lrb- 08.05.2007 -rrb- eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wolfowitz have to leave the wolrd bank headquarters in washington , d.c. ?
" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .
some 5,000 people took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities in protest at the police raids . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wolfowitz have to leave the wolrd bank headquarters in washington , d.c. ?
" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wolfowitz have to leave the wolrd bank headquarters in washington , d.c. ?
" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .

" " we will now see how he plans to make that work , " merkel told reporters in brussels . constitution on the agenda merkel said she and sarkozy would discuss " current issues and the preparation of the european council in june , " at which germany hopes to obtain agreement among the 27 eu member states on the main planks of a new european treaty . during his election campaign , sarkozy promoted the idea of a " mini treaty " to replace the original eu draft constitution , which has been in limbo ever since french and dutch voters rejected it in referendum in 2005 . asked whether she saw sarkozy as a team player in europe , merkel replied that " to win in a team game you need all your players . " turkey 's eu membership turkey is expected to be another hot topic between merkel and sarkozy , who are united in their opposition to the primarily muslim country joining the 27-member bloc . however , after sarkozy 's election on may 6 , the european commission insisted that negotiations on three of the 35 policy chapters necessary for turkey 's eu membership would resume before the end of the german presidency on june 30 . on tuesday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan warned sarkozy that hostility towards turkey 's bid for eu membership would fan anti-europe sentiments among turks and damage bilateral ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has so far completed talks only on one of the 35 accession chapters " mr. sarkozy has to overcome his prejudices .

he has instead called for a " privileged partnership " between the eu and turkey . for his part , erdogan stressed the need for turkey to " build warmer ties with the french people " .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .
in the meantime , as europe awaits this high-technology navigation projects , a separate egnos system will enter operation by 2008 , improving the quality of gps signals to pinpoint a location within five meters . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .

demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .

the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .

a 21-gun salute rang out as the official results of sarkozy 's election victory were read out to an audience of invited guests in the palace 's ornate main reception hall .
" the people have given me a mandate , " france 's new right-wing president said in a 10-minute televised address .
" i will carry it out .
i will carry it out scrupulously , with the desire to be worthy of the trust that the french have placed in me . "

" i want to tell you what a great honor it has been to serve you , " chirac said .
" i want to tell you how strong is the bond that from the depths of my heart unites me with every man and woman among you . "
on leaving the elysee , chirac and his wife bernadette were taken to their new temporary home in an apartment on the seine river overlooking the louvre museum .
the flat has been loaned by the family of assassinated former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , who was a close friend of the chiracs .

future plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has vowed to reform france in his address to the nation , chirac confirmed that he plans to set up a foundation later this year devoted to " dialogue between cultures and sustainable development . "
before then he is likely to face questioning from judges looking into allegations of illegal party funding during his 18-year stint as mayor of paris .
chirac 's presidential immunity expires on june 16 , and judicial officials have told afp it is " most probable " he will be interviewed as a witness in a probe into a kickback scheme for paying party workers .

a 21-gun salute rang out as the official results of sarkozy 's election victory were read out to an audience of invited guests in the palace 's ornate main reception hall .
" the people have given me a mandate , " france 's new right-wing president said in a 10-minute televised address .
" i will carry it out .
i will carry it out scrupulously , with the desire to be worthy of the trust that the french have placed in me . "
" i will defend the independence of france , i will defend the identity of france .
i will ensure respect for state authority , and above all its impartiality , " sarkozy said .

he has vowed to act fast in office , calling a special session of the national assembly in july to pass a first wave of reforms - including tax cuts , trade union reforms , new controls on immigration and tougher sentencing rules for serial offenders .
his first political task is to appoint a caretaker government to lead the ruling ump into parliamentary elections on june 10 and 17 .
on thursday , sarkozy is expected to name former social affairs minister francois fillon , 53 , as prime minister .

" i want to tell you what a great honor it has been to serve you , " chirac said .
" i want to tell you how strong is the bond that from the depths of my heart unites me with every man and woman among you . "
on leaving the elysee , chirac and his wife bernadette were taken to their new temporary home in an apartment on the seine river overlooking the louvre museum .
the flat has been loaned by the family of assassinated former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , who was a close friend of the chiracs .

chirac 's presidential immunity expires on june 16 , and judicial officials have told afp it is " most probable " he will be interviewed as a witness in a probe into a kickback scheme for paying party workers .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 16.05.2007 eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu feels that no further delays in the galileo project should be permitted the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors . the commission complained that the technical complexity of the project , the time and costs to build it and obstacles posed by the private builders had all been underestimated and that no further delays could be permitted .
the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .
in the meantime , as europe awaits this high-technology navigation projects , a separate egnos system will enter operation by 2008 , improving the quality of gps signals to pinpoint a location within five meters . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wolfowitz have to leave the wolrd bank headquarters in washington , d.c. ?
" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .
the us , which has chosen every world bank president since the lender 's founding in 1944 , has stood by bush 's nominee . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 aims to link aid , social standards in developing world labor and employment ministers from the world 's richest nations appealed to developing countries and emerging economies to improve social standards .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

" " we will now see how he plans to make that work , " merkel told reporters in brussels . constitution on the agenda merkel said she and sarkozy would discuss " current issues and the preparation of the european council in june , " at which germany hopes to obtain agreement among the 27 eu member states on the main planks of a new european treaty . during his election campaign , sarkozy promoted the idea of a " mini treaty " to replace the original eu draft constitution , which has been in limbo ever since french and dutch voters rejected it in referendum in 2005 . asked whether she saw sarkozy as a team player in europe , merkel replied that " to win in a team game you need all your players . " turkey 's eu membership turkey is expected to be another hot topic between merkel and sarkozy , who are united in their opposition to the primarily muslim country joining the 27-member bloc . however , after sarkozy 's election on may 6 , the european commission insisted that negotiations on three of the 35 policy chapters necessary for turkey 's eu membership would resume before the end of the german presidency on june 30 . on tuesday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan warned sarkozy that hostility towards turkey 's bid for eu membership would fan anti-europe sentiments among turks and damage bilateral ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has so far completed talks only on one of the 35 accession chapters " mr. sarkozy has to overcome his prejudices .
if we are to unite civilizations within the eu , if we say the eu is not a christian club , then mr. sarkozy should review his opinions , " erdogan said at the annual assembly of the media watchdog international press institute in istanbul . sarkozy opposes turkey 's eu membership on the grounds that most of turkey 's territory is in asia and that the idea of a united europe would be diluted if its borders stretch that far .
he has instead called for a " privileged partnership " between the eu and turkey . for his part , erdogan stressed the need for turkey to " build warmer ties with the french people " .

" " we will now see how he plans to make that work , " merkel told reporters in brussels . constitution on the agenda merkel said she and sarkozy would discuss " current issues and the preparation of the european council in june , " at which germany hopes to obtain agreement among the 27 eu member states on the main planks of a new european treaty . during his election campaign , sarkozy promoted the idea of a " mini treaty " to replace the original eu draft constitution , which has been in limbo ever since french and dutch voters rejected it in referendum in 2005 . asked whether she saw sarkozy as a team player in europe , merkel replied that " to win in a team game you need all your players . " turkey 's eu membership turkey is expected to be another hot topic between merkel and sarkozy , who are united in their opposition to the primarily muslim country joining the 27-member bloc . however , after sarkozy 's election on may 6 , the european commission insisted that negotiations on three of the 35 policy chapters necessary for turkey 's eu membership would resume before the end of the german presidency on june 30 . on tuesday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan warned sarkozy that hostility towards turkey 's bid for eu membership would fan anti-europe sentiments among turks and damage bilateral ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has so far completed talks only on one of the 35 accession chapters " mr. sarkozy has to overcome his prejudices .
if we are to unite civilizations within the eu , if we say the eu is not a christian club , then mr. sarkozy should review his opinions , " erdogan said at the annual assembly of the media watchdog international press institute in istanbul . sarkozy opposes turkey 's eu membership on the grounds that most of turkey 's territory is in asia and that the idea of a united europe would be diluted if its borders stretch that far .
he has instead called for a " privileged partnership " between the eu and turkey . for his part , erdogan stressed the need for turkey to " build warmer ties with the french people " . " i hope our relationship with mr. sarkozy will move to a more positive direction in time because , i believe , -lrb- countries around -rrb- the world need each other , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sees no chance for christian reference in eu charter german chancellor angela merkel has said she has " given up hope " of having a reference to europe 's judeo-christian heritage enshrined in the new version of the european union constitution .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .

60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .

the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .
some 5,000 people took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities in protest at the police raids . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .
-lrb- 15.05.2007 -rrb- reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

a 21-gun salute rang out as the official results of sarkozy 's election victory were read out to an audience of invited guests in the palace 's ornate main reception hall .
" the people have given me a mandate , " france 's new right-wing president said in a 10-minute televised address .
" i will carry it out .
i will carry it out scrupulously , with the desire to be worthy of the trust that the french have placed in me . "
" i will defend the independence of france , i will defend the identity of france .
i will ensure respect for state authority , and above all its impartiality , " sarkozy said .

his first political task is to appoint a caretaker government to lead the ruling ump into parliamentary elections on june 10 and 17 .
on thursday , sarkozy is expected to name former social affairs minister francois fillon , 53 , as prime minister .
fillon successfully negotiated reforms to the pensions system in 2003 .

" i want to tell you what a great honor it has been to serve you , " chirac said .
" i want to tell you how strong is the bond that from the depths of my heart unites me with every man and woman among you . "
on leaving the elysee , chirac and his wife bernadette were taken to their new temporary home in an apartment on the seine river overlooking the louvre museum .
the flat has been loaned by the family of assassinated former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , who was a close friend of the chiracs .
they are expected to stay there until they find a place of their own in paris .
future plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has vowed to reform france in his address to the nation , chirac confirmed that he plans to set up a foundation later this year devoted to " dialogue between cultures and sustainable development . "
before then he is likely to face questioning from judges looking into allegations of illegal party funding during his 18-year stint as mayor of paris .
chirac 's presidential immunity expires on june 16 , and judicial officials have told afp it is " most probable " he will be interviewed as a witness in a probe into a kickback scheme for paying party workers .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.05.2007 german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf von faber-castell heads the globally known pencil firm that bears his name a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .
their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .
some 5,000 people took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities in protest at the police raids . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wolfowitz have to leave the wolrd bank headquarters in washington , d.c. ?
" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .
in the meantime , as europe awaits this high-technology navigation projects , a separate egnos system will enter operation by 2008 , improving the quality of gps signals to pinpoint a location within five meters . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.05.2007 opinion : commodification and privatization of the planet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiva is a well-known environmental activist by protecting seeds und intellectual property laws , the g8 is encouraging the privatization of life , providing monopoly market access to multinational corporations and driving thousands of indian farmers to suicide . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .

the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .

last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .

" i want to tell you how strong is the bond that from the depths of my heart unites me with every man and woman among you . "
on leaving the elysee , chirac and his wife bernadette were taken to their new temporary home in an apartment on the seine river overlooking the louvre museum .

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .

the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .

in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wolfowitz have to leave the wolrd bank headquarters in washington , d.c. ?
" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .
the us , which has chosen every world bank president since the lender 's founding in 1944 , has stood by bush 's nominee . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 aims to link aid , social standards in developing world labor and employment ministers from the world 's richest nations appealed to developing countries and emerging economies to improve social standards .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .
the choice of scenario is due to be made by eu transport ministers at their next formal meeting in brussels june 7-8 .
in the meantime , as europe awaits this high-technology navigation projects , a separate egnos system will enter operation by 2008 , improving the quality of gps signals to pinpoint a location within five meters . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .
-lrb- 08.05.2007 -rrb- eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .
-lrb- 05.05.2007 -rrb- eu warns against further delays to galileo system the european commission warned that it will examine new ways to complete the galileo satellite navigation system after the project stalled amid doubts about profitability .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .

on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .

demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .

a 21-gun salute rang out as the official results of sarkozy 's election victory were read out to an audience of invited guests in the palace 's ornate main reception hall .
" the people have given me a mandate , " france 's new right-wing president said in a 10-minute televised address .
" i will carry it out .
i will carry it out scrupulously , with the desire to be worthy of the trust that the french have placed in me . "
" i will defend the independence of france , i will defend the identity of france .
i will ensure respect for state authority , and above all its impartiality , " sarkozy said .
a family affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's wife cecilia attended the inaugural ceremony among guests at the elysee were sarkozy 's wife cecilia , their 10-year-old son louis and the four grown-up children they have from previous marriages .
small crowds lined the street outside .
the new president 's first function was to rekindle the flame on the tomb of the unknown soldier beneath the arc de triomph and lay a wreath at a statue of general charles de gaulle .
he then flew to berlin for a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel , where the future of the european union was the main issue for discussion .
a wave of reforms a former interior minister and head of the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , sarkozy was elected president on may 6 , easily beating the socialist segolene royal on a promise of radical economic and social reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she would have been france 's first female president : segolene royal " there is a demand for change , " sarkozy said in his inaugural address .
" never have the risks of inertia been so great for france as they are now in this world in flux where everyone across the world is trying to change quicker than the others , where any delay can be fatal . "
he has vowed to act fast in office , calling a special session of the national assembly in july to pass a first wave of reforms - including tax cuts , trade union reforms , new controls on immigration and tougher sentencing rules for serial offenders .
his first political task is to appoint a caretaker government to lead the ruling ump into parliamentary elections on june 10 and 17 .
on thursday , sarkozy is expected to name former social affairs minister francois fillon , 53 , as prime minister .
fillon successfully negotiated reforms to the pensions system in 2003 .
the full cabinet is expected to be announced shortly thereafter .
bernard kouchner - a socialist ex-minister who founded the charity doctors without borders - has been named as a likely surprise foreign minister .

an emotional farewell on tuesday , chirac bid an emotional farewell to the nation , urging the people to remain " united and together " under sarkozy .
" i want to tell you what a great honor it has been to serve you , " chirac said .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "
as a fall back option , the eu 's executive arm also suggests that the 27 country bloc could fund construction of the first 18 satellites , with industry taking on the rest , if possible .

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .
when the owner of a family-owned business dies , the firm can be faced with a tax bill of up to 50 percent of the value of the company .
that has led to many , he said , having to sell the business or simply shut their doors . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porsche reportedly mulls volkswagen takeover german sports car maker porsche said saturday it wants to make a bid for the giant volkswagen group , in which it already holds a 27.3 percent stake .

" he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- would do the bank and himself a great service if he resigned , " wieczorek-zeul told journalists on wednesday in berlin .
" that would be the best thing for everybody involved . "
should he fail to quit his post , she advised him not to take part in a two-day world bank forum on development aid for africa which starts monday in the german capital .
" i would not advise him to -lrb- take part -rrb- if he 's still in office , " she said , referring to wolfowitz .
an internal world bank report found wolfowitz broke ethics rules and triggered a leadership crisis at the bank by arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , a former world bank employee , when she transferred to the us state department .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has denied any wrongdoing wolfowitz , who is the former us deputy defense secretary , remained defiant on tuesday as he appeared before the 24-nation world bank board . he denied he broke ethics rules in arranging a hefty pay raise for his girlfriend after becoming the bank 's president in june 2005 .
" i respectfully submit , to criticize my actions or to find them as a basis for a loss of confidence would be grossly unfair and would be contrary to the evidence we have presented to you , " wolfowitz said in a statement to the board .
" rather than fix blame for something that was n't wrong , we should all acknowledge our responsibility as i have acknowledged mine , " he said , conceding he made mistakes .
wolfowitz 's lawyer robert bennett told reporters : " we presented to them -lrb- the board -rrb- overpowering evidence that he -lrb- wolfowitz -rrb- acted at all times in the best interests of the bank and in good faith . " the board was expected to deliberate wednesday , extending an impasse that has pitted european governments outspokenly critical of wolfowitz against us president george w bush , who tapped the co- architect of the iraq war to head the world bank in 2005 .
european nations decline to support wolfowitz key european nations including france , germany and the netherlands have declined to support wolfowitz since the furor reached a fever pitch last month .
the european commission has said it is worried about the impact of the allegations on the world bank 's credibility as a key partner for european development actions in africa and other parts of the world .

" a strong world bank president is needed to mobilize the money , " wieczorek-zeul said after talks with european union counterparts in brussels on tuesday .
" we development-aid ministers know how to speak diplomatically and still get our message across . "
" what we hope is that the integrity and the credibility of the bank can be preserved , that is to say re-established , " wieczorek-zeul said , stressing that she was speaking on behalf of all eu development ministers who met for talks in brussels .
a shift in the white house ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is worried about the world bank 's credibility in the developing world but the white house signaled a shift tuesday that may point the way toward a settlement between the bank and wolfowitz , who has vowed not to quit under " bogus charges " that he acted unethically .
comments by us officials suggested that a deal could involve the board closing the ethics inquiry without demanding wolfowitz 's resignation .
instead , the bank would open a broad review to decide whether wolfowitz is still fit to lead the 185-nation development agency .
" at some point in the future there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the world bank , " bush 's chief spokesman tony snow said on tuesday .
" in that sense ... all options are on the table . "
he refused to speculate whether that includes wolfowitz 's removal at a later date.wolfowitz " made mistakes " in handling his companion 's promotion , but these were not " firing offences , " snow said .
a highly critical report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house has so far stood by the world bank chief pressure mounted for wolfowitz to quit after the bank 's investigating panel on monday issued a highly critical , 52-page report .
the panel expressed concern that the scandal had hurt the bank 's reputation , hampered its mission of fighting poverty and disease and undermined a global anti-corruption drive that wolfowitz has made the hallmark of his tenure .
" mr wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply , " it said .
" it evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self interest over institutional best interest . "
european governments have led the public campaign to oust wolfowitz , who has made widespread foes among bank staff and senior managers .

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .

other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .
not all rosy despite the good performance , heidbreder says family-owned firms still face hurdles that others do not , particularly in the areas of international accounting standards and inheritance taxes .

their success could provide a lesson to the blue chip companies . while the german economy might be humming along nicely right now , the years 2003 to 2005 were not particularly memorable ones .
the country 's gross domestic product actually shrank in 2003 by 0.2 percent .
it rebounded somewhat in the following two years , but growth rates of 1.6 and 0.9 percent are n't much to write home about .
the slump was reflected in the personnel policies of germany 's 30 biggest companies trading on the frankfurt stock exchange - companies like adidas , bayer and lufthansa , also known as the dax 30 .
overall , they reduced their domestic employment rolls by 3.5 percent .
but during that same period , 500 of the country 's biggest family-owned companies increased their workforces by some 10 percent .
these are some of the findings released this month in a study carried out by the institut für mittelstandsforschung -lrb- ifm -rrb- , which conducts research on the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises , a category including most family-owned businesses .
ifm classifies as small and medium sized enterprises those firms with sales up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67.7 million -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news on the dax was n't all that good from 2003 to 2005 about 95 percent of the 3.2 million german companies fall in to the category of " family owned , " according to the family-owned business foundation , which financed the study .
they generate 41 percent of the sales volume of all german companies .
the study 's results point to the fact that family-owned businesses are a key motor in the german economy .
while the big shareholder-owned multinationals might get much of the press , those companies still in the hands of one or a few families are showing that they have plenty of muscle , and could show the big dax companies how to better weather tough economic times .
dax companies did see a nine percent increase in sales volume over those three lean years , but family-owned businesses , according to the study 's findings , saw a 16 percent jump in sales in the same period .
" family-owned businesses did do something better , somehow better positioned themselves , " said frank wallau , ifm 's interim director .
" although it 's difficult to determine a direct causal link between being family owned and being successful . "
different philosophy but stefan heidbreder , director of the family-owned business foundation , says he believes that the success has a great deal to do with the character of many family-owned businesses .
he points out that there is often a different management and business philosophy at play than at large companies owned by anonymous shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just getting through a shareholders ' meeting unscathed is a main goal of some managers at big corporations in a family-owned business , at least 50 percent of the company is owned by one or several families .
the owners and managers are often the same people , or the owners hire outside managers .
in either case , according to heidbreder , it leads to a different kind of strategic thinking - one that focuses on long-term interests instead of quick results .
" a family-owned business thinks in generational terms , " he said .
" they 're not only concerned about making as much cash as quickly as possible or surviving the next shareholders meeting . "
he compares it to two scenarios of buying a car .
if someone were told to buy a car and simply given the money for it , he would think differently than he would if he were spending his own money on the car .
" he would ask himself , ' is it a good car for the money ? '
' will it last ? '
' what if something happens to my kids tomorrow ? ' , " he said .
if someone else is fronting the cash , the risks taken are different , and perhaps not as well thought out .
international , but home ties strong the term " family owned " does not have to mean a mom and pop operation - the study looked at companies employing from 20 to 256,915 workers - and included big players such as würth , a maker of fixing and assembly materials which operates in 83 countries , sennheiser , which makes audio equipment , and trumpf , a leader in laser technology .
many have found success in specializing in high-quality products for niche markets and have become export champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee at würth while these firms are all active internationally , many still have ties to the region where they are based .
many owner-families have run the companies for generations , and have closer links with employees .
that can result in a greater sense of responsibility for their well-being unlike at the giants , where increasing shareholder value often trumps any other concern .
other advantages family-owned business can enjoy are increased flexibility , and with owners and managers being either the same person or enjoying a close relationship , they can make business decisions responding to market developments often much faster than large concerns , where decisions often have to work their way through committees and boards .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .

" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .

money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .
setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's fathers also stay home more " the more companies encourage their male employees to play an active role as fathers , the more of an example this will set for other men to find the courage and do the same , " von der leyen said .
" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .
this week , german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition approved a plan championed by von der leyen to triple the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

money to stay home under a new financial scheme for parents in germany which came into effect on january 1 in germany , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of a new baby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister von der leyen and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .
the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .
around 90 percent of fathers in iceland take advantage of the opportunity , and take an average of 97 days off from work to stay at home with a new child . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .

in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy . the biggest threats posed by globalization are the commodification and privatization of the planet . the trade related intellectual property rights -lrb- trips -rrb- agreement of wto at the 1996 uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade marked a key turn in the intellectual property process by privatizing life forms and biodiversity . trips not only made intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- laws global geographically , it also removed ethical boundaries by patenting life forms and biodiversity .
living organisms and self-creating life forms , including seeds , were thus redefined as machines and artifacts made and invented by the patentee . under intellectual property rights and gave the patent holder a monopolistic right to prevent others from making , using or selling seeds .
seed saving by farmers has now been shifted from a " sacred duty " to a criminal offence of stealing " property . "
article 27.3 -lrb- b -rrb- of the trips agreement , which relates to patents on living resources , was basically pushed by the life science companies to establish themselves as lords of life . patenting life as a result of trips , the chemical companies of the world have bought up seed and biotechnology companies and reorganized themselves as life science corporations , claiming patents on genes , seeds , plants and animals . eighty percent of all genetically engineered seeds planted are the intellectual property of monsanto .
the agricultural company also owns patents on a wide variety of cotton , mustard , soyabean - seeds that were not " invented " or " created " by monsanto but have been evolved over centuries of innovation by farmers relying on natural biodiversity . as a result of globalization , corporations like monsanto have gained monopoly control over seeds .
in india , they first entered through hybrid cottonseeds and later with genetically engineered insect-resistant bt cottonseeds .
high cost seeds , which are both non-renewable and unreliable , have resulted in severe hardship indian farmers , driving thousands to suicide .
in a parliamentary debate in 2006 , the government figures were 150,000 farm suicides in the last decade .
the " suicide belt " overlaps with regions where corporations like monsanto have established seed monopolies . g8 promoting monopoly markets yet , instead of promoting access to seed for all farmers and access to medicines for all , the g8 is promoting monopoly access to markets for the corporations , which are also the seed biotechnology giants . the priorities for the g8 as identified by the personal advisor to the chancellor repeatedly refers to stronger ipr rights for corporations while failing to take account of the consequences of seed patents for farmers .
the note on priorities states : " innovation is at the root of welfare in knowledge-based societies .
protection of innovation , especially in international trade and investment relations , plays a decisive role for the willingness to invest in research and development .
we see a need for action particularly in the improvement of international cooperation to implement intellectual property rights in the fight against product and brand piracy . " there is no mention of biopiracy as a part of intellectual property rights .
product patents are assumed to be a right , and process patents are defined as “ product piracy . "
this is a direct support to corporate seed monopolies . instead of making a commitment to the outstanding review of trips , the g8 priority is to create new agreements to enforce monopolies and patent violations for corporations . if trips has killed hundreds of thousands of farmers in india , by denying them seeds , how much more violence will an expanded version of trips , driven by the g8 , unleash on the poor of the world ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 16.05.2007 eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu feels that no further delays in the galileo project should be permitted the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors . the commission complained that the technical complexity of the project , the time and costs to build it and obstacles posed by the private builders had all been underestimated and that no further delays could be permitted .
the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .
the eight - aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales - had been given until may 10 to sort out the mess but that deadline passed with no action .
" this is already the third crisis that we are stuck in , " european parliamentarian ulrich stockmann told dw-world.de.
" it is scary how we keep postponing the start of operations .
first we wanted to be ready by 2008 , now we 're talking about 2012 , while industry is secretly talking about 2014 . "
experts fears that a delay in the launch of galileo could hurt its future , with competition from russia and china and a high-performance gps iii system which could to go into operation from 2013 .
" if galileo would only come in 2014 or 2015 , we would not need it anymore , " galileo expert carsten rolle from the german industry federation -lrb- bdi -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" at that point , it would be hard to find a market for it . "
a hazardous scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems are already widely used in cars were it to continue to struggle on as planned , the eu report said that the full partnership between the public and private sector in the galileo project " would not commence before mid-2009 and full deployment would be delayed until 2014 or later . "
it said that taking over the project 's building phase would provide greater certainty , best use of investment and value for money and get the system up and running more quickly .
" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .
but barrot said that huge amounts - about eight billion euros , according to the commission 's estimates - would be recovered from future revenue .
civilian control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hiker uses the gps device to check trails the system will remain under civilian control but it is possible that the military , security sector or police will be able to use it , bringing in more money .
" we think it will actually turn out cheaper and there will be fewer risks because they will have been clarified , " barrot said .
" we will take the risk of construction , but the consortium will have the risk of managing it . "

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "
competing with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner jacques barrot comprising 30 satellites , galileo is meant to compete with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , a free military-run network used widely in cars , boats and aircraft but also in mapping , fisheries and scientific research .
but delays have piled up amid infighting between members of the consortium of private builders which had been expected to construct and manage the project .

" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .

more flexible notions of gender roles would make it easier to combine work and families and it would also help eu countries to better tackle the challenges of demographic changes and boost economies , the statement said .
the role of fathers in helping to raise their children and the challenge this poses to the economy was also one of the central issues of the conference .
" young men who opt for an active role as father are often looked viewed as wimps by society , " said german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen .
von der leyen urged employers to support men seeking to commit themselves to such a role .
in germany , the government has recently introduced incentives for parents taking time off work to look after their children .

" europe needs a policy that puts men and women on an equal footing so it is easier for them to combine work , family life and taking care of dependents , " she said .
eu social affairs commissioner vladimir spidla called for a change of attitude among european men that would lead them to taking on more responsibilities in the family .
firms should also do more to provide more child care facilities for their employees , the czech eu commissioner said in an interview with dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often juggle work and family in addition to the changing roles for fathers in child care , the conference also focused on equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace and in the family .

the plan to create new daycare facilities and the financing scheme for parents are two major steps the german government has taken to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
until now , working women in germany have had a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which has partially contributed to the low birth rate in the country .
other eu countries are also making headway in modernizing the role of men in the family . in iceland , for example , until 2000 , men generally did not stay home to care for children , but a new law now makes it possible for them to do so .

" as host of the g8 summit , we have a duty to do everything to protect our guests , " hanning told german public broadcaster ard .
authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long security fence around the g8 venue .
germany is expecting up to 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators to target the gathering of world leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in northeastern germany .
on wednesday , police in rostock , a northern german city located just 23 kilometers from heiligendamm , said all public gatherings and demonstrations within 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- of the security fence surrounding the g8 meeting area will be banned between may 30 and june 8 - the day the summit ends .
from june 2 to june 8 , protests and demonstrations will also be forbidden at the rostock-laage airport which serves heiligendamm .
" a real security threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 demonstrators in heiligendamm in april police said the measures were justified because " anti-globalization activists have repeatedly called for a veritable blockade of the g8 summit .
" this shows that there is a real security threat for those participating in the summit . "
the internet portal of the weekly magazine stern reported that during the actual summit , demonstrations within a two-kilometer radius would be prohibited .
afp news agency , however , said protestors would not be allowed within a five-kilometer radius of the baltic sea resort town .
last week , when rostock police initially announced its intention to prohibit nearby protests , they said it was to " ensure the area surrounding heiligendamm would be open for police and emergency vehicles . "
hanning said that police were now aware of " potentially dangerous " actions planned by people who intended to destroy the security fences and disrupt the summit .
he said the decision to prohibit public gatherings near the fence was a " legitimate , preventative police procedure . "
he also said that the disruptions could not only pose a threat to g8 leaders , but to nearby g8 opponents as well .
rallies possible elsewhere bildunterschrift : protest at the g8 summit near gleneagles , scotland in 2005 hanning said , however , that german authorities still wanted to ensure that " rallies can take place which aim to criticize the g8 summit and certain aspects of globalization . "
demonstrations which had been previously registered would now be reviewed based on the new ordinance , hanning said .
60 demonstrations had been registered in all , 10 of which were authorized by police .
but g8 summit opponents are angered .
one told ap new agency : " people who have officially registered demonstrations these past few months have been deceived . "
summit opponents said it was a constitutional right to be able to protest .
possible appeals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and anti-g8 protesters clashed in gleneagles opponents have said they will take legal action to appeal the ban , but the organization gipfelsoli infogruppe said that the late announcement by police was a delaying tactic intended to make it difficult for opponents to appeal .
the prohibition will affect the " star march , " which had been planned with protestors moving in from different locations to gather at heiligendamm , where a rally was also scheduled .
smaller protests near the security fences will also be affected .
the decision follows on the heels of a major raid last week on the homes and offices of of left-wing g8 and anti-globalization activists .
around 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation was slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state . the operation angered left-wing groups who warned that it only served to mobilize their followers .
some 5,000 people took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities in protest at the police raids . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

the report notes that " five years have been lost already compared to original schedules and at significant costs . "
" there have been delays and there can be no more delays , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
" galileo 's potential will not be realized simply because galileo will arrive too late . "

" there was a scenario which was a hazardous one , " barrot said .
" we will change the scenario to remove the hazardous elements . "
brussels estimates that it could require up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- all tolled in public funds until 2030 - which includes the 20-year period during which industry will manage the system .

they say they are treated like second-class citizens .
to spearhead their fight for equality , they have set up the association of short people in cameroon -lrb- aspc -rrb- , which has been officially registered .
to belong to the association , prospective members have to be no taller than 1.60m -lrb- 5 ' 2 " -rrb- .
this height limitation was increased from the original 1.56m , following protests from those who were taller than the intended limit but still considered themselves to be short people .
height restrictions bamenda-based jurist and founding aspc president , jonathan fru , 61 , says the reasons for creating the association are simple . "
joining this association has given me some self-esteem " stephen ngang , 1.20m -lrb- 3 ' 9 " -rrb- " we felt that we should protect our interests .
during recruitment , especially into the armed forces , there is always a height limit which disqualifies many short people -lsb- a person must be above 1.65m -lrb- 5 ' 4 " -rrb- to join the armed forces in cameroon -rsb- , " he says .
" carpenters make chairs that are too high for us and so we are not comfortable sitting with others , " he says .
" we have difficulties reaching high counters in shops and in banks , then to add insult to injury , all billboards are high up in the air and we have to strain to read them . "
the associations ' president adds that they have begun a vigorous campaign to right these wrongs and have so far met the provincial governor to table their grievances .
as if to prove that good things can come in small packages , the association has the shortest constitution i have ever come across - just two pages long .
they also have an anthem which is just two sentences long - " if you want to join the short peoples ' association , you just come , for we are peaceful , you just come " .
' abuse ' stephen ngang is the shortest registered member of the association and says he is living proof of the problems short people face daily .
standing only 1.20m -lrb- 3 ' 9 " -rrb- and now 49 years old , he has no job and is still unmarried . "
do short people know we also have problems ? "
john , 2m -lrb- 6 ' 6 " -rrb- " joining this association has given me some self-esteem and i have now asked my elder sister to look for a wife for me , " he says timidly .
he is unsure how he will feed his wife and children -lrb- if he has any -rrb- , considering that he is jobless .
mr fru says he did not meet his wife , who is taller than him , until he was 30 years old - seen as late in cameroon .
he blames his late social development squarely on the shoulders of his 1.53m -lrb- 5 ' -rrb- frame and the low self-esteem that this caused .
" i do n't want other short people to suffer as i did , which is why i created this association , " he says firmly .
some tall people i met were , however , dismissive of the grouping of short people .
" being short is not a problem - i wish i was shorter , " said john , standing tall at 2m -lrb- 6 ' 6 " -rrb- .
" do short people know we also have problems ? " he asked .
" being too tall sometimes affects my balance and i need to bend down sometimes to listen to my short wife " he said jokingly .
a secondary school teacher blamed administrative officials for giving legal recognition to the association in the first place .
" it is an abuse and ridicules the laws regulating the creation of associations in cameroon , " he said .
respect jaqueline sirri , 25 and 1.56m -lrb- 5 ' 1 " -rrb- , is happily married but is still upset that she was disqualified from sitting for the army exams last year because of her height .
she says she is much happier since she joined the aspc and wants the rights of all short men and women nationwide to be respected .
" we are normal human beings , our height notwithstanding , " she says .
the short people deny discriminating against their taller brethren through their height restriction and insist that they do not see tall people as enemies .
they say they just want to be treated with the same respect as the rest of the population .
is it harder for short people to succeed in life ?
or do you think this campaign is a waste of time ?
your comments : it is not hard for short people to succeed in life if he / she is determine .
but here in cameroon it is very difficult for a short person to have a job like joining the police force and the arm force .
recognising the aspc it means things will change for the short people .
let the aspc members go ahead with the struggle .
kum ignatius , buea , cameroon as a tall person i regularly have to go down on my knees to retrieve snacks from vending machines , hotel showers are generally at shoulder height despite there being ample space for the shower head to be fitted higher , i have to squat to read the displays on ticket machines and some cash machines are below my waist height !
it 's lead to a life of backache !
oh to be ' average ' !
daniel , guildford , uk i am a cameroonian and lived in bamenda for about 20 years .
the truth is nothing is built with accessibility access in cameroon .
the idea of an association for short people sounds like a joke .
i must agree short people as disabled people face social discriminations in cameroon which need to be addressed .
however , we cannot have short people in the military .
there are some jobs where height can not be overlooked .
on the positive side , as the cameroonian military is the most inactive in the world , short and disabled people can realistically survive .
muma kaba , newcastle - england in my country short people are sometimes looked upon as being crooked and there are some who are referred to as ' chiluba ' - the former president owing to his plunder cases .
i would n't know if it 's harder but generally zambians are short and it 's not an issue really .
taller people are seen as being rather dull so ... the campaign is worth it i guess .
jethro , lusaka , zambia i am just under five feet tall .
when i lived in the us i was made to feel like a child sometimes , even when i was in my early 30s !
it is hard for a woman to be taken seriously in some professional situations , and you have to augment your presence in other ways .
now that i have moved to south india where many adults are naturally short , height is simply not an issue for me any more .
it depends solely on the culture of where you are living .
j mackenzie murthy , bangalore , india i think forming the " association for short people in cameroon " is trying to duplicate associations , which by the end of the day serve the same purpose .
to be born too short or too tall is a genetic problem , and it is quite difficult for one to run away from it .
in other terms this is a disability , because it disables one to operate the same with other people , as they have narrated .
i believe that they -lrb- cameroonians -rrb- have an association or a ministry that takes care for the disabled , which this group of people should fall within .
why not affiliating themselves to this group .
i am afraid , because people with too small or too large heads , etcetera , may start thinking of forming their associations as well .
harris manyozo , lilongwe , malawi i think they are on the right track since there are a lot of discrimination based on beauty , height and other physical characteristics in daily social life .
i think the next one should be the association of ugly peoples who are highly stigmatised form economic and social life .
nukong , kampala , uganda my height is only 1.43 m .
i think it is harder to succeed in life as most of the time , people will not take me seriously .
they think that i was still in high school where in fact my age is around 30 .
how could i nurture a networking -lrb- which is partly expected within my job -rrb- when people think i am too " young " -lrb- shorter people usually have baby face -rrb- to be seen as an important person ?
tia , loughborough what is important about a human being is his / her decency but not his / her height .
any decent person deserves to be treated with the same respect irrespective of his / her height .
it goes without saying !
my height is 1.74m.
if a person is a decent and clever one then height of a person does not matter to the person .
yuri sevastyanov , kharkov , ukraine i think its true that some facilities were not designed with such short people in mind , i therefore think that its time now for designers to think of this category as they think of disabled .
again , it is also true that they are discriminated from some jobs , but for the army i think there is a reason for doing that and i think its for their benefit and for the nation as well , in other jobs there is no point why they should not be taken .
the campaign should go on !
heri , coventry , uk i disagree , short people are far from being physically disabled , and yet people with disabilities are fighting and managing to succeed in this african life .
they just have to fight and excel in life , that 's the best model for their counterparts .
if a few succeed and excel , others will know it is possible and will do likewise .
philippe masengo , lusaka here in the sudan , people are treated according to their economic success .
a rich short man is respected more than a poor tall man .
and a well educated short man earns more respect and special treatment than uneducated tall man .
so short people in cameroun should learn to fit in the changes of the present world .
idra kimu , juba , sudan the story of my life .
being from venezuela but from bolivian stock .
my mother raised my brother and i in trinidad where people are tall , and it seemed that apart from being way out ethnically our short height , always seemed to matter .
at high school a guy always bullied me just because i was short .
later in life and back in venezuela a sad marriage flopped head over heels because my girl shunned my stature .
hence all my life i became keenly aware of the subject and questioned parents who were short and whose sons were tall , and then set to test a theory with exit on my first child who is now 11 .
inspired on wattusi 's up thrust dance , i had him ever soaring up and everyone says now he is quite tall for his age and had it not been for his face one would have second thoughts that he was my son .
nutrition-wise i also followed some good counsel and it did the trick .
in our values distorted society yes height plays a role but you just have to be from lilliput -lrb- a fictional kingdom where people were small -rrb- to understand .
antonio cardenas , caracas , venezuela i think this campaign is a complete waste of time since there is no discrimination existing ... what matters most to anyone is the sound faculty that one possesses .
there are more things in life that one should worry about than just indulging oneself in self-pettiness .
mahmoud a ali , benghazi , libya success in life does not depend on height , i have seen quite a number of short but successful men and women in east africa .
well they are entitled to their opinions .
juma delu , juba , south sudan congratulations to those people who have come out to share their views and the problems that they face in regards to their height .
well i am a papua new guinean , female student attending one of the finest university in my country and i am 159cm tall aged 20 .
there is nothing wrong with either being tall or short .
everyone is created by god according to his own likeness and image and we should not discriminate anyone according to their physical appearance .
if in the case of applying for a job , our qualifications should be the far most important point to look at then simple measures such as height difference and so forth .
no matter the height difference life has so many things to offer , you can succeed in whatever you want to do in life , and not bow down to any criticism or barriers in life .
we are all controllers of our own life and in order to succeed you have to keep your head up high and go forward to achieve your dreams .
this campaign is a very good way to inform everyone that height does n't matter but it is what 's inside you that counts in the end .
joanne map kilip , papua new guinea i think it is harder for short people to succeed in life .
in general , people always tend to say looks do n't matter , but when someone sees you , the first impression they form of you is on your appearance and the above dilemma in this story applies to fat people as well .
seriously , the first time a person meets a fat person , the first thing that comes to their mind is ' oh , this guy is faaat ! '
the same goes for short people .
it 's hard to have a high self esteem when people tend to form this negative mindset barrier the moment they see you just because of the way you look , without taking into consideration your personality .
and i speak from experience , people always make fun of short people or fat people and i know again from a personal experience that such people indeed tend to suffer socially and have a low self esteem .
i do n't think it 's fair for them .
basira ali ahmed , dubai , uae defining success in short people and tall people , i think only depends on the choice of one person 's career to pursue .
that 's why i would say that the height of a person is not a basis of succeeding in life 's journey it is in his / her will and goals in life .
i ca n't say your successful because your a billionaire and neither unsuccessful of being in the middle class of society .
finally , i will say that a person 's success in life can only be measure by himself alone whether he / she is content in the life he / she stands in society and not because of his height or any physical differences .
jemuel lao digaum , iligan city , philippines it 's true that we usually despise the people who are shorter than the average high .
i myself find that people in taiwan also prefer higher to shorter .
this association reminds us that there still have a lot of different kinds of abuse of human rights , and therefore , we have to instil the concept of human rights in our next generation .
tseng , taipei , taiwan it 's not your height that matters , it 's your heart .
just consider little zacchaeus when and after he met jesus .
peter hussey yeo , southsea , uk it 's a good thing to have such an organization .
even here in kenya it is very hard for a short person to join the military .
i wish we had such an organization in kenya .

jonathan fru -lrb- l -rrb- says billboards are too high for short people they say they are treated like second-class citizens .
to spearhead their fight for equality , they have set up the association of short people in cameroon -lrb- aspc -rrb- , which has been officially registered .
to belong to the association , prospective members have to be no taller than 1.60m -lrb- 5 ' 2 " -rrb- .
this height limitation was increased from the original 1.56m , following protests from those who were taller than the intended limit but still considered themselves to be short people .
height restrictions bamenda-based jurist and founding aspc president , jonathan fru , 61 , says the reasons for creating the association are simple .
joining this association has given me some self-esteem stephen ngang , 1.20m -lrb- 3 ' 9 " -rrb- " we felt that we should protect our interests .
during recruitment , especially into the armed forces , there is always a height limit which disqualifies many short people -lsb- a person must be above 1.65m -lrb- 5 ' 4 " -rrb- to join the armed forces in cameroon -rsb- , " he says .
" carpenters make chairs that are too high for us and so we are not comfortable sitting with others , " he says .
" we have difficulties reaching high counters in shops and in banks , then to add insult to injury , all billboards are high up in the air and we have to strain to read them . "
the associations ' president adds that they have begun a vigorous campaign to right these wrongs and have so far met the provincial governor to table their grievances .
as if to prove that good things can come in small packages , the association has the shortest constitution i have ever come across - just two pages long .
they also have an anthem which is just two sentences long - " if you want to join the short peoples ' association , you just come , for we are peaceful , you just come " .
' abuse ' stephen ngang is the shortest registered member of the association and says he is living proof of the problems short people face daily .
standing only 1.20m -lrb- 3 ' 9 " -rrb- and now 49 years old , he has no job and is still unmarried .
do short people know we also have problems ?
john , 2m -lrb- 6 ' 6 " -rrb- " joining this association has given me some self-esteem and i have now asked my elder sister to look for a wife for me , " he says timidly .
he is unsure how he will feed his wife and children -lrb- if he has any -rrb- , considering that he is jobless .
mr fru says he did not meet his wife , who is taller than him , until he was 30 years old - seen as late in cameroon .
he blames his late social development squarely on the shoulders of his 1.53m -lrb- 5 ' -rrb- frame and the low self-esteem that this caused .
" i do n't want other short people to suffer as i did , which is why i created this association , " he says firmly .
some tall people i met were , however , dismissive of the grouping of short people .
" being short is not a problem - i wish i was shorter , " said john , standing tall at 2m -lrb- 6 ' 6 " -rrb- .
" do short people know we also have problems ? " he asked .
" being too tall sometimes affects my balance and i need to bend down sometimes to listen to my short wife " he said jokingly .
a secondary school teacher blamed administrative officials for giving legal recognition to the association in the first place .
" it is an abuse and ridicules the laws regulating the creation of associations in cameroon , " he said .
respect jaqueline sirri , 25 and 1.56m -lrb- 5 ' 1 " -rrb- , is happily married but is still upset that she was disqualified from sitting for the army exams last year because of her height .
she says she is much happier since she joined the aspc and wants the rights of all short men and women nationwide to be respected .
" we are normal human beings , our height notwithstanding , " she says .
the short people deny discriminating against their taller brethren through their height restriction and insist that they do not see tall people as enemies .
they say they just want to be treated with the same respect as the rest of the population .
is it harder for short people to succeed in life ?
or do you think this campaign is a waste of time ?
your comments : it is not hard for short people to succeed in life if he / she is determine .
but here in cameroon it is very difficult for a short person to have a job like joining the police force and the arm force .
recognising the aspc it means things will change for the short people .
let the aspc members go ahead with the struggle .
kum ignatius , buea , cameroon as a tall person i regularly have to go down on my knees to retrieve snacks from vending machines , hotel showers are generally at shoulder height despite there being ample space for the shower head to be fitted higher , i have to squat to read the displays on ticket machines and some cash machines are below my waist height !
it 's lead to a life of backache !
oh to be ' average ' !
daniel , guildford , uk i am a cameroonian and lived in bamenda for about 20 years .
the truth is nothing is built with accessibility access in cameroon .
the idea of an association for short people sounds like a joke .
i must agree short people as disabled people face social discriminations in cameroon which need to be addressed .
however , we cannot have short people in the military .
there are some jobs where height can not be overlooked .
on the positive side , as the cameroonian military is the most inactive in the world , short and disabled people can realistically survive .
muma kaba , newcastle - england in my country short people are sometimes looked upon as being crooked and there are some who are referred to as ' chiluba ' - the former president owing to his plunder cases .
i would n't know if it 's harder but generally zambians are short and it 's not an issue really .
taller people are seen as being rather dull so ... the campaign is worth it i guess .
jethro , lusaka , zambia i am just under five feet tall .
when i lived in the us i was made to feel like a child sometimes , even when i was in my early 30s !
it is hard for a woman to be taken seriously in some professional situations , and you have to augment your presence in other ways .
now that i have moved to south india where many adults are naturally short , height is simply not an issue for me any more .
it depends solely on the culture of where you are living .
j mackenzie murthy , bangalore , india i think forming the " association for short people in cameroon " is trying to duplicate associations , which by the end of the day serve the same purpose .
to be born too short or too tall is a genetic problem , and it is quite difficult for one to run away from it .
in other terms this is a disability , because it disables one to operate the same with other people , as they have narrated .
i believe that they -lrb- cameroonians -rrb- have an association or a ministry that takes care for the disabled , which this group of people should fall within .
why not affiliating themselves to this group .
i am afraid , because people with too small or too large heads , etcetera , may start thinking of forming their associations as well .
harris manyozo , lilongwe , malawi i think they are on the right track since there are a lot of discrimination based on beauty , height and other physical characteristics in daily social life .
i think the next one should be the association of ugly peoples who are highly stigmatised form economic and social life .
nukong , kampala , uganda my height is only 1.43 m .
i think it is harder to succeed in life as most of the time , people will not take me seriously .
they think that i was still in high school where in fact my age is around 30 .
how could i nurture a networking -lrb- which is partly expected within my job -rrb- when people think i am too " young " -lrb- shorter people usually have baby face -rrb- to be seen as an important person ?
tia , loughborough what is important about a human being is his / her decency but not his / her height .
any decent person deserves to be treated with the same respect irrespective of his / her height .
it goes without saying !
my height is 1.74m.
if a person is a decent and clever one then height of a person does not matter to the person .
yuri sevastyanov , kharkov , ukraine i think its true that some facilities were not designed with such short people in mind , i therefore think that its time now for designers to think of this category as they think of disabled .
again , it is also true that they are discriminated from some jobs , but for the army i think there is a reason for doing that and i think its for their benefit and for the nation as well , in other jobs there is no point why they should not be taken .
the campaign should go on !
heri , coventry , uk i disagree , short people are far from being physically disabled , and yet people with disabilities are fighting and managing to succeed in this african life .
they just have to fight and excel in life , that 's the best model for their counterparts .
if a few succeed and excel , others will know it is possible and will do likewise .
philippe masengo , lusaka here in the sudan , people are treated according to their economic success .
a rich short man is respected more than a poor tall man .
and a well educated short man earns more respect and special treatment than uneducated tall man .
so short people in cameroun should learn to fit in the changes of the present world .
idra kimu , juba , sudan the story of my life .
being from venezuela but from bolivian stock .
my mother raised my brother and i in trinidad where people are tall , and it seemed that apart from being way out ethnically our short height , always seemed to matter .
at high school a guy always bullied me just because i was short .
later in life and back in venezuela a sad marriage flopped head over heels because my girl shunned my stature .
hence all my life i became keenly aware of the subject and questioned parents who were short and whose sons were tall , and then set to test a theory with exit on my first child who is now 11 .
inspired on wattusi 's up thrust dance , i had him ever soaring up and everyone says now he is quite tall for his age and had it not been for his face one would have second thoughts that he was my son .
nutrition-wise i also followed some good counsel and it did the trick .
in our values distorted society yes height plays a role but you just have to be from lilliput -lrb- a fictional kingdom where people were small -rrb- to understand .
antonio cardenas , caracas , venezuela i think this campaign is a complete waste of time since there is no discrimination existing ... what matters most to anyone is the sound faculty that one possesses .
there are more things in life that one should worry about than just indulging oneself in self-pettiness .
mahmoud a ali , benghazi , libya success in life does not depend on height , i have seen quite a number of short but successful men and women in east africa .
well they are entitled to their opinions .
juma delu , juba , south sudan congratulations to those people who have come out to share their views and the problems that they face in regards to their height .
well i am a papua new guinean , female student attending one of the finest university in my country and i am 159cm tall aged 20 .
there is nothing wrong with either being tall or short .
everyone is created by god according to his own likeness and image and we should not discriminate anyone according to their physical appearance .
if in the case of applying for a job , our qualifications should be the far most important point to look at then simple measures such as height difference and so forth .
no matter the height difference life has so many things to offer , you can succeed in whatever you want to do in life , and not bow down to any criticism or barriers in life .
we are all controllers of our own life and in order to succeed you have to keep your head up high and go forward to achieve your dreams .
this campaign is a very good way to inform everyone that height does n't matter but it is what 's inside you that counts in the end .
joanne map kilip , papua new guinea i think it is harder for short people to succeed in life .
in general , people always tend to say looks do n't matter , but when someone sees you , the first impression they form of you is on your appearance and the above dilemma in this story applies to fat people as well .
seriously , the first time a person meets a fat person , the first thing that comes to their mind is ' oh , this guy is faaat ! '
the same goes for short people .
it 's hard to have a high self esteem when people tend to form this negative mindset barrier the moment they see you just because of the way you look , without taking into consideration your personality .
and i speak from experience , people always make fun of short people or fat people and i know again from a personal experience that such people indeed tend to suffer socially and have a low self esteem .
i do n't think it 's fair for them .
basira ali ahmed , dubai , uae defining success in short people and tall people , i think only depends on the choice of one person 's career to pursue .
that 's why i would say that the height of a person is not a basis of succeeding in life 's journey it is in his / her will and goals in life .
i ca n't say your successful because your a billionaire and neither unsuccessful of being in the middle class of society .
finally , i will say that a person 's success in life can only be measure by himself alone whether he / she is content in the life he / she stands in society and not because of his height or any physical differences .
jemuel lao digaum , iligan city , philippines it 's true that we usually despise the people who are shorter than the average high .
i myself find that people in taiwan also prefer higher to shorter .
this association reminds us that there still have a lot of different kinds of abuse of human rights , and therefore , we have to instil the concept of human rights in our next generation .

jonathan fru -lrb- l -rrb- says billboards are too high for short people they say they are treated like second-class citizens .
to spearhead their fight for equality , they have set up the association of short people in cameroon -lrb- aspc -rrb- , which has been officially registered .
to belong to the association , prospective members have to be no taller than 1.60m -lrb- 5 ' 2 " -rrb- .
this height limitation was increased from the original 1.56m , following protests from those who were taller than the intended limit but still considered themselves to be short people .
height restrictions bamenda-based jurist and founding aspc president , jonathan fru , 61 , says the reasons for creating the association are simple .
joining this association has given me some self-esteem stephen ngang , 1.20m -lrb- 3 ' 9 " -rrb- " we felt that we should protect our interests .
during recruitment , especially into the armed forces , there is always a height limit which disqualifies many short people -lsb- a person must be above 1.65m -lrb- 5 ' 4 " -rrb- to join the armed forces in cameroon -rsb- , " he says .
" carpenters make chairs that are too high for us and so we are not comfortable sitting with others , " he says .
" we have difficulties reaching high counters in shops and in banks , then to add insult to injury , all billboards are high up in the air and we have to strain to read them . "
the associations ' president adds that they have begun a vigorous campaign to right these wrongs and have so far met the provincial governor to table their grievances .
as if to prove that good things can come in small packages , the association has the shortest constitution i have ever come across - just two pages long .
they also have an anthem which is just two sentences long - " if you want to join the short peoples ' association , you just come , for we are peaceful , you just come " .
' abuse ' stephen ngang is the shortest registered member of the association and says he is living proof of the problems short people face daily .
standing only 1.20m -lrb- 3 ' 9 " -rrb- and now 49 years old , he has no job and is still unmarried .
do short people know we also have problems ?
john , 2m -lrb- 6 ' 6 " -rrb- " joining this association has given me some self-esteem and i have now asked my elder sister to look for a wife for me , " he says timidly .
he is unsure how he will feed his wife and children -lrb- if he has any -rrb- , considering that he is jobless .
mr fru says he did not meet his wife , who is taller than him , until he was 30 years old - seen as late in cameroon .
he blames his late social development squarely on the shoulders of his 1.53m -lrb- 5 ' -rrb- frame and the low self-esteem that this caused .
" i do n't want other short people to suffer as i did , which is why i created this association , " he says firmly .
some tall people i met were , however , dismissive of the grouping of short people .
" being short is not a problem - i wish i was shorter , " said john , standing tall at 2m -lrb- 6 ' 6 " -rrb- .
" do short people know we also have problems ? " he asked .
" being too tall sometimes affects my balance and i need to bend down sometimes to listen to my short wife " he said jokingly .
a secondary school teacher blamed administrative officials for giving legal recognition to the association in the first place .
" it is an abuse and ridicules the laws regulating the creation of associations in cameroon , " he said .
respect jaqueline sirri , 25 and 1.56m -lrb- 5 ' 1 " -rrb- , is happily married but is still upset that she was disqualified from sitting for the army exams last year because of her height .
she says she is much happier since she joined the aspc and wants the rights of all short men and women nationwide to be respected .
" we are normal human beings , our height notwithstanding , " she says .
the short people deny discriminating against their taller brethren through their height restriction and insist that they do not see tall people as enemies .
they say they just want to be treated with the same respect as the rest of the population .
is it harder for short people to succeed in life ?
or do you think this campaign is a waste of time ?
your comments : it is not hard for short people to succeed in life if he / she is determine .
but here in cameroon it is very difficult for a short person to have a job like joining the police force and the arm force .
recognising the aspc it means things will change for the short people .
let the aspc members go ahead with the struggle .
kum ignatius , buea , cameroon as a tall person i regularly have to go down on my knees to retrieve snacks from vending machines , hotel showers are generally at shoulder height despite there being ample space for the shower head to be fitted higher , i have to squat to read the displays on ticket machines and some cash machines are below my waist height !
it 's lead to a life of backache !
oh to be ' average ' !
daniel , guildford , uk i am a cameroonian and lived in bamenda for about 20 years .
the truth is nothing is built with accessibility access in cameroon .
the idea of an association for short people sounds like a joke .
i must agree short people as disabled people face social discriminations in cameroon which need to be addressed .
however , we cannot have short people in the military .
there are some jobs where height can not be overlooked .
on the positive side , as the cameroonian military is the most inactive in the world , short and disabled people can realistically survive .
muma kaba , newcastle - england in my country short people are sometimes looked upon as being crooked and there are some who are referred to as ' chiluba ' - the former president owing to his plunder cases .
i would n't know if it 's harder but generally zambians are short and it 's not an issue really .
taller people are seen as being rather dull so ... the campaign is worth it i guess .
jethro , lusaka , zambia i am just under five feet tall .
when i lived in the us i was made to feel like a child sometimes , even when i was in my early 30s !
it is hard for a woman to be taken seriously in some professional situations , and you have to augment your presence in other ways .
now that i have moved to south india where many adults are naturally short , height is simply not an issue for me any more .
it depends solely on the culture of where you are living .
j mackenzie murthy , bangalore , india i think forming the " association for short people in cameroon " is trying to duplicate associations , which by the end of the day serve the same purpose .
to be born too short or too tall is a genetic problem , and it is quite difficult for one to run away from it .
in other terms this is a disability , because it disables one to operate the same with other people , as they have narrated .
i believe that they -lrb- cameroonians -rrb- have an association or a ministry that takes care for the disabled , which this group of people should fall within .
why not affiliating themselves to this group .
i am afraid , because people with too small or too large heads , etcetera , may start thinking of forming their associations as well .
harris manyozo , lilongwe , malawi i think they are on the right track since there are a lot of discrimination based on beauty , height and other physical characteristics in daily social life .
i think the next one should be the association of ugly peoples who are highly stigmatised form economic and social life .
nukong , kampala , uganda my height is only 1.43 m .
i think it is harder to succeed in life as most of the time , people will not take me seriously .
they think that i was still in high school where in fact my age is around 30 .
how could i nurture a networking -lrb- which is partly expected within my job -rrb- when people think i am too " young " -lrb- shorter people usually have baby face -rrb- to be seen as an important person ?
tia , loughborough what is important about a human being is his / her decency but not his / her height .
any decent person deserves to be treated with the same respect irrespective of his / her height .
it goes without saying !
my height is 1.74m.
if a person is a decent and clever one then height of a person does not matter to the person .
yuri sevastyanov , kharkov , ukraine i think its true that some facilities were not designed with such short people in mind , i therefore think that its time now for designers to think of this category as they think of disabled .
again , it is also true that they are discriminated from some jobs , but for the army i think there is a reason for doing that and i think its for their benefit and for the nation as well , in other jobs there is no point why they should not be taken .
the campaign should go on !
heri , coventry , uk i disagree , short people are far from being physically disabled , and yet people with disabilities are fighting and managing to succeed in this african life .
they just have to fight and excel in life , that 's the best model for their counterparts .
if a few succeed and excel , others will know it is possible and will do likewise .
philippe masengo , lusaka here in the sudan , people are treated according to their economic success .
a rich short man is respected more than a poor tall man .
and a well educated short man earns more respect and special treatment than uneducated tall man .
so short people in cameroun should learn to fit in the changes of the present world .
idra kimu , juba , sudan the story of my life .
being from venezuela but from bolivian stock .
my mother raised my brother and i in trinidad where people are tall , and it seemed that apart from being way out ethnically our short height , always seemed to matter .
at high school a guy always bullied me just because i was short .
later in life and back in venezuela a sad marriage flopped head over heels because my girl shunned my stature .
hence all my life i became keenly aware of the subject and questioned parents who were short and whose sons were tall , and then set to test a theory with exit on my first child who is now 11 .
inspired on wattusi 's up thrust dance , i had him ever soaring up and everyone says now he is quite tall for his age and had it not been for his face one would have second thoughts that he was my son .
nutrition-wise i also followed some good counsel and it did the trick .
in our values distorted society yes height plays a role but you just have to be from lilliput -lrb- a fictional kingdom where people were small -rrb- to understand .
antonio cardenas , caracas , venezuela i think this campaign is a complete waste of time since there is no discrimination existing ... what matters most to anyone is the sound faculty that one possesses .
there are more things in life that one should worry about than just indulging oneself in self-pettiness .
mahmoud a ali , benghazi , libya success in life does not depend on height , i have seen quite a number of short but successful men and women in east africa .
well they are entitled to their opinions .
juma delu , juba , south sudan congratulations to those people who have come out to share their views and the problems that they face in regards to their height .
well i am a papua new guinean , female student attending one of the finest university in my country and i am 159cm tall aged 20 .
there is nothing wrong with either being tall or short .
everyone is created by god according to his own likeness and image and we should not discriminate anyone according to their physical appearance .
if in the case of applying for a job , our qualifications should be the far most important point to look at then simple measures such as height difference and so forth .
no matter the height difference life has so many things to offer , you can succeed in whatever you want to do in life , and not bow down to any criticism or barriers in life .
we are all controllers of our own life and in order to succeed you have to keep your head up high and go forward to achieve your dreams .
this campaign is a very good way to inform everyone that height does n't matter but it is what 's inside you that counts in the end .
joanne map kilip , papua new guinea i think it is harder for short people to succeed in life .
in general , people always tend to say looks do n't matter , but when someone sees you , the first impression they form of you is on your appearance and the above dilemma in this story applies to fat people as well .
seriously , the first time a person meets a fat person , the first thing that comes to their mind is ' oh , this guy is faaat ! '
the same goes for short people .
it 's hard to have a high self esteem when people tend to form this negative mindset barrier the moment they see you just because of the way you look , without taking into consideration your personality .
and i speak from experience , people always make fun of short people or fat people and i know again from a personal experience that such people indeed tend to suffer socially and have a low self esteem .
i do n't think it 's fair for them .
basira ali ahmed , dubai , uae defining success in short people and tall people , i think only depends on the choice of one person 's career to pursue .
that 's why i would say that the height of a person is not a basis of succeeding in life 's journey it is in his / her will and goals in life .
i ca n't say your successful because your a billionaire and neither unsuccessful of being in the middle class of society .
finally , i will say that a person 's success in life can only be measure by himself alone whether he / she is content in the life he / she stands in society and not because of his height or any physical differences .
jemuel lao digaum , iligan city , philippines it 's true that we usually despise the people who are shorter than the average high .
i myself find that people in taiwan also prefer higher to shorter .
this association reminds us that there still have a lot of different kinds of abuse of human rights , and therefore , we have to instil the concept of human rights in our next generation .
tseng , taipei , taiwan it 's not your height that matters , it 's your heart .
just consider little zacchaeus when and after he met jesus .
peter hussey yeo , southsea , uk it 's a good thing to have such an organization .
even here in kenya it is very hard for a short person to join the military .
i wish we had such an organization in kenya .

figures show two-thirds of heads could retire in the next decade .
the national association of head teachers also warned extra workloads and long hours put new recruits off .
the general teaching council said it was training a new generation , and the assembly government said wales was well served in the pool of future heads .
figures from the general teaching council of wales -lrb- gtcw -rrb- , the body which regulates teachers in wales , show that just over 66 % of heads wereaged 50 or over .
gtcw chief executive gary brace said most head teachers would naturally fall into the older age bracket because of the experience and expertise needed for the role . "

" many of our members are running two schools at the moment , " said iwan guy from naht cymru .

" i enjoy my job but i also think there is a general ignorance as to what teaching in general entails and what headship entails - it is an extremely demanding role , " he said .
qualifications to become a head teacher in the uk , applicants are required to pass the national professional qualification for headship -lrb- npqh -rrb- qualification .

" it 's not the money , it 's because of the job itself , " he said .
heledd hayes from the national union of teachers -lrb- nut -rrb- cymru said the effect on schools of not having a full time head could be destabilising for staff .
however , mr brace of gtcw said its statistics showed there was an increase in the number of npqh-qualified teachers rising through the ranks who could take the place of those retiring over the next 10 years .
applicants he said 250 out of the 1000 teachers who had achieved the headship qualification had gained a headship .
a total of 170 were currently going through the npqh with another 149 accepted on the course in the latest recruitment round , he added .
a recent estyn survey also found for every head teacher post advertised there were between 6 and 15 applicants .
mr brace also highlighted that the number of teachers in their early 40 's who hold the npqh had increased over the last five years from 9 % to 12 % of the total .

the general teaching council said it was training a new generation , and the assembly government said wales was well served in the pool of future heads .
figures from the general teaching council of wales -lrb- gtcw -rrb- , the body which regulates teachers in wales , show that just over 66 % of heads wereaged 50 or over .

heledd hayes from the national union of teachers -lrb- nut -rrb- cymru said the effect on schools of not having a full time head could be destabilising for staff .

their study showed taking multivitamins more than seven times a week was associated with an increased risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancer .
there was no link with early cancer or localised prostate cancer , the researchers wrote in the journal of the national cancer institute .
experts advised men to eat a healthy diet to reduce their risk of cancer .
the findings , based on data on nearly 300,000 men , indicated the risk of advanced prostate cancer is 32 % higher in men who take multivitamins more than once a day than in those who do not take them at all .
risk of fatal prostate cancer was almost double . "
it 's still not entirely clear what factors can affect a man 's risk of developing prostate cancer " liz baker , cancer research uk the correlation was strongest for men with a family history of the disease , and who also took selenium , beta-carotene or zinc supplements .
it is unclear why the multivitamins may increase the risk of certain types of prostate cancer .
study leader dr karla lawson from the us national cancer institute said : " the possibility that men taking high levels of multivitamins along with other supplements have increased risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancers is of concern and merits further evaluation . "
because multivitamins contain so many different components and men taking a lot of them were more likely to be taking other supplements , the researchers were unable to tease out what was causing the association .
in an accompanying editorial , european researchers said a high intake of fruit and vegetables has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer .
but it is not clear which nutrients have a positive effect .
antioxidants there has been a lot of research into antioxidants such as vitamin c and e because it is believed they may protect cells against damage .
however , some analyses have suggested that beta-carotene , vitamin a and vitamin e supplements may shorten life rather than extend it .
the amounts of antioxidants needed to offer any potential protection are not known and may differ between individuals .
liz baker , science information officer at cancer research uk , said : " it 's still not entirely clear what factors can affect a man 's risk of developing prostate cancer .
" and there is conflicting evidence on the pros and cons of vitamin supplements .
" these products do n't seem to give us the same benefits as vitamins that naturally occur in our food .
" we encourage people wanting to reduce their risk of cancer to eat a diet rich in fibre , vegetables and fruit , and low in red and processed meat . "
georgia diebel , a specialist nurse at the prostate cancer charity said : " with all vitamins , we recommend that men do not exceed the daily recommended dose stated on the bottle .
" people often think of them as something ' natural ' and do not understand that they still have to be metabolised and used by the body - a study like this suggests they are not safe in larger quantities . "
prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men .
it kills one man every hour in the uk .

their study showed taking multivitamins more than seven times a week was associated with an increased risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancer .
there was no link with early cancer or localised prostate cancer , the researchers wrote in the journal of the national cancer institute .
experts advised men to eat a healthy diet to reduce their risk of cancer .
the findings , based on data on nearly 300,000 men , indicated the risk of advanced prostate cancer is 32 % higher in men who take multivitamins more than once a day than in those who do not take them at all .
risk of fatal prostate cancer was almost double .
it 's still not entirely clear what factors can affect a man 's risk of developing prostate cancer liz baker , cancer research uk the correlation was strongest for men with a family history of the disease , and who also took selenium , beta-carotene or zinc supplements .
it is unclear why the multivitamins may increase the risk of certain types of prostate cancer .
study leader dr karla lawson from the us national cancer institute said : " the possibility that men taking high levels of multivitamins along with other supplements have increased risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancers is of concern and merits further evaluation . "
because multivitamins contain so many different components and men taking a lot of them were more likely to be taking other supplements , the researchers were unable to tease out what was causing the association .
in an accompanying editorial , european researchers said a high intake of fruit and vegetables has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer .
but it is not clear which nutrients have a positive effect .
antioxidants there has been a lot of research into antioxidants such as vitamin c and e because it is believed they may protect cells against damage .
however , some analyses have suggested that beta-carotene , vitamin a and vitamin e supplements may shorten life rather than extend it .
the amounts of antioxidants needed to offer any potential protection are not known and may differ between individuals .

at least one program is in circulation that can hijack a key component of windows update to introduce malicious software that could be used to hijack a computer .
the method bypasses users ' firewall , allowing files to download undetected .
microsoft said it was aware of reports of the attack .
using bits to download malicious files is a clever trick because it bypasses local firewalls elia florio , symantec security expert frank boldewin said on his website reconstructer.org that he had recently noticed an e-mailed trojan - a type of program or message that looks benign but conceals a malicious payload - which was exploiting a windows program known as the background intelligent transfer service -lrb- bits -rrb- .
bits is used by microsoft to download security patches and updates to windows machines .
because it is part of the operating system , it is able to bypass local firewalls while it downloads .
mr boldewin found the trojan was piggybacking on bits to download malicious files .
he published " proof of concept " code to illustrate how it went about it .
not suspicious after analysing this code elia florio , a researcher at security firm symantec , wrote in her blog : " using bits to download malicious files is a clever trick because it bypasses local firewalls , as the download is performed by windows itself , and does not require suspicious actions for process injection . "
however , microsoft said that for bits to be exploited , machines first had to become infected with the trojan that mr boldewin discovered .
a spokesperson for the software giant said : " microsoft is aware of public reports that background intelligent transfer service -lrb- bits -rrb- is being used by trojandownloader : win32 / jowspry to bypass policy-based firewalls in order to install additional malware .
" the bypass relies on -lsb- jowspry -rsb- already being present on the system ; it is not an attack vector for initial infection .
" the bypass most commonly occurs after a successful social engineering attempt lures the user into inadvertently running -lsb- jowspry -rsb- , which then utilizes bits to download additional malware . "
security consultant robert schifreen told the bbc news website : " in some ways it is immaterial that it is using bits .
" the simple message is not to get infected in the first place .

at least one program is in circulation that can hijack a key component of windows update to introduce malicious software that could be used to hijack a computer .
the method bypasses users ' firewall , allowing files to download undetected .
microsoft said it was aware of reports of the attack .
using bits to download malicious files is a clever trick because it bypasses local firewalls elia florio , symantec security expert frank boldewin said on his website reconstructer.org that he had recently noticed an e-mailed trojan - a type of program or message that looks benign but conceals a malicious payload - which was exploiting a windows program known as the background intelligent transfer service -lrb- bits -rrb- .
bits is used by microsoft to download security patches and updates to windows machines .
because it is part of the operating system , it is able to bypass local firewalls while it downloads .
mr boldewin found the trojan was piggybacking on bits to download malicious files .
he published " proof of concept " code to illustrate how it went about it .
not suspicious after analysing this code elia florio , a researcher at security firm symantec , wrote in her blog : " using bits to download malicious files is a clever trick because it bypasses local firewalls , as the download is performed by windows itself , and does not require suspicious actions for process injection . "
however , microsoft said that for bits to be exploited , machines first had to become infected with the trojan that mr boldewin discovered .
a spokesperson for the software giant said : " microsoft is aware of public reports that background intelligent transfer service -lrb- bits -rrb- is being used by trojandownloader : win32 / jowspry to bypass policy-based firewalls in order to install additional malware .
" the bypass relies on -lsb- jowspry -rsb- already being present on the system ; it is not an attack vector for initial infection .
" the bypass most commonly occurs after a successful social engineering attempt lures the user into inadvertently running -lsb- jowspry -rsb- , which then utilizes bits to download additional malware . "

bits is used by microsoft to download security patches and updates to windows machines .
because it is part of the operating system , it is able to bypass local firewalls while it downloads .
mr boldewin found the trojan was piggybacking on bits to download malicious files .
he published " proof of concept " code to illustrate how it went about it .

now 74 , mr chirac first became a government minister some 40 years ago and has been a part of french public life ever since for better or for worse .
so what state does he leave france in at home and abroad ?
the young jacques chirac managed to charm voters le monde 's cartoonist plantu , whom mr chirac has provided with endless raw material over the years , said that , in an odd and almost inexplicable way , the french will miss him - even if they are looking forward to having a new generation in the elysee palace .
" jacques chirac will leave his mark as a man the french liked .
it 's incredible , " he said .
" everyone was under his spell .
they all say ' he 's lovely - he 's funny - he 's charming ' and that 's one reason i never wanted to meet him .
" people are strange - because at the same time , they grumble that mr chirac is a crook , and that , as mayor of paris , he cooked the books to help fund his centre-right rpr political party .
" but then they shrug and say : ' ah well , in his position i 'd probably have done the same thing ' . "
scandal-ridden charmer mr chirac has long proved a potent force in french politics - as a handsome young man , cigarette dangling from one hand , a glass of beer in the other , he fought his way into parliament in the rural constituency of correze .
he charmed the french people into voting for him with his ability to empathise and press the flesh with conviction , whether with farmers , young women or business leaders .
chirac : like a granddad who nicks your money , says cartoonist plantu his first ministerial job was back in 1967 , under georges pompidou , and there are few government positions he has not held at one time or another .
later , as mayor of paris for almost two decades from 1977 to 1995 , he was dogged by scandal over party financing and personal expenses , with his closest ally alain juppe being convicted a few years ago of using parisian taxpayers ' money to fund rpr party workers disguised as town hall employees .
but that did not stop jacques chirac winning the presidency in 1995 , taking over at the elysee palace from francois mitterrand to cheers and jubilation on the right , after beating the socialist lionel jospin .
he won again in 2002 , against all the odds and the hostile opinion polls , thanks to mr le pen 's shock entry into the second round .
alienation the french sniffed that they had the choice between voting for a crook or voting for a fascist , with some socialist voters pictured going to the polls with pegs on their noses to symbolise their disgust .
mr chirac still won his second and now final term .
mr chirac might face a corruption inquiry after his term ends " there is a certain sense of nostalgia , now the man is nearly out , " said dominique moisi , senior fellow at the ifri foreign affairs institute in paris .
" and a sense of lost opportunity .
he failed to reconcile the french with politics .
there were scandals , there was a sense of alienation between the people and the political centre .
" and , more fundamentally , he failed to reform france or bring france in tune with modernity .
but on the positive side , he will be remembered as the man who said ' no ' to the war in iraq , and the man who reconciled the french with their wwii past .
" but somehow , jacques chirac failed with the present , and succeeded with the past . "
opposing iraq as president , jacques chirac always looked happiest on the world stage , forcibly putting france 's point of view .
he continued president mitterrand 's legacy of seeing africa as france 's backyard , and tried to repair french relations with its former colonies .
on the middle east , he ensured that france remained an influence on its old colonies there - lebanon and syria - while trying to make sure that his nation kept a voice in the middle east peace process .
chirac leaves france in a weaker position in europe , and it 's undeniable that today there is less france in europe and as a result , there is less europe in the world dominique moisi ifri foreign affairs institute profile : jacques chirac and of course , in 2003 , he said " no " to the war in iraq .
that french " no " to the war frayed relations with the us and britain , most of all with president george w bush , leaving bilateral ties in a fragile state for his successor .
mr chirac was long against a world influenced by one global hyper-power , especially a power run by george w bush .
marc epstein , foreign editor of the centrist l 'express magazine , said that at a human level , the two leaders were never destined to be friends .
" you can not imagine two men more different .
mr bush is a reformed alcoholic , who believes in god and preaches at people .
" mr chirac is someone who likes to have a good time , have a few beers , and he is on the record as saying transparency in politics does n't matter .
the two men are polar opposites . "
yet mr chirac also leaves behind tensions over europe .
he liked the idea of the eu - especially a union dominated by france and germany .
but he disliked europe 's enlargement to the east to include nations such as poland and the czech republic , whom he saw as washington and london 's trojan horse , working towards an eu that was more a free market , and less a political counterweight to the might of the us .
2005 also brought its own european humiliation for jacques chirac , when his disgruntled nation said its own firm " non " to the eu constitutional treaty .
" chirac leaves france in a weaker position in europe , and it 's undeniable that today there is less france in europe and as a result , there is less europe in the world , " believes dominique moisi .
but if chirac 's " no " to iraq is still widely admired at home , his domestic triumphs have been few and far between .
loveable rogue after 12 years in power , he leaves behind high unemployment , low economic growth and a generous welfare system that tomorrow 's france can ill-afford , as well as increasing divides between the cities and the suburbs , the " haves " and the " have-nots " of french society .
chirac offered rich material for cartoonists " he had a mandate to reform and did not use it .
one of the reasons is that , in some ways , he is a man of another generation , a ' socialist radical ' , a man of the third or fourth republic - a man suspicious of globalisation and of the market , " says moisi .
yet even those who clearly saw mr chirac 's weaknesses throughout his long career agree that the nation still feels a surprising fondness for the loveable rogue who just kept on being elected - even if today 's france , the house that jacques built , is gradually falling apart .
" i 'll miss chirac in the same way you 'd miss your granddad who used to nick the cash you left in the kitchen , " said le monde 's cartoonist plantu .
" he was a nice bloke .
even if when you open the kitchen drawers , you discover they 're empty .
and as for the rest of the house - well , there 's water leaking down the walls of the living room , cracks everywhere , and a hole in the roof .
but jacques chirac was a nice bloke . "

alienation the french sniffed that they had the choice between voting for a crook or voting for a fascist , with some socialist voters pictured going to the polls with pegs on their noses to symbolise their disgust .
mr chirac still won his second and now final term .
mr chirac might face a corruption inquiry after his term ends " there is a certain sense of nostalgia , now the man is nearly out , " said dominique moisi , senior fellow at the ifri foreign affairs institute in paris .
" and a sense of lost opportunity .
he failed to reconcile the french with politics .
there were scandals , there was a sense of alienation between the people and the political centre .
" and , more fundamentally , he failed to reform france or bring france in tune with modernity .
but on the positive side , he will be remembered as the man who said ' no ' to the war in iraq , and the man who reconciled the french with their wwii past .
" but somehow , jacques chirac failed with the present , and succeeded with the past . "
opposing iraq as president , jacques chirac always looked happiest on the world stage , forcibly putting france 's point of view .
he continued president mitterrand 's legacy of seeing africa as france 's backyard , and tried to repair french relations with its former colonies .
on the middle east , he ensured that france remained an influence on its old colonies there - lebanon and syria - while trying to make sure that his nation kept a voice in the middle east peace process .
chirac leaves france in a weaker position in europe , and it 's undeniable that today there is less france in europe and as a result , there is less europe in the world dominique moisi ifri foreign affairs institute profile : jacques chirac and of course , in 2003 , he said " no " to the war in iraq .
that french " no " to the war frayed relations with the us and britain , most of all with president george w bush , leaving bilateral ties in a fragile state for his successor .
mr chirac was long against a world influenced by one global hyper-power , especially a power run by george w bush .
marc epstein , foreign editor of the centrist l 'express magazine , said that at a human level , the two leaders were never destined to be friends .
" you can not imagine two men more different .
mr bush is a reformed alcoholic , who believes in god and preaches at people .
" mr chirac is someone who likes to have a good time , have a few beers , and he is on the record as saying transparency in politics does n't matter .
the two men are polar opposites . "
yet mr chirac also leaves behind tensions over europe .
he liked the idea of the eu - especially a union dominated by france and germany .
but he disliked europe 's enlargement to the east to include nations such as poland and the czech republic , whom he saw as washington and london 's trojan horse , working towards an eu that was more a free market , and less a political counterweight to the might of the us .
2005 also brought its own european humiliation for jacques chirac , when his disgruntled nation said its own firm " non " to the eu constitutional treaty .
" chirac leaves france in a weaker position in europe , and it 's undeniable that today there is less france in europe and as a result , there is less europe in the world , " believes dominique moisi .
but if chirac 's " no " to iraq is still widely admired at home , his domestic triumphs have been few and far between .
loveable rogue after 12 years in power , he leaves behind high unemployment , low economic growth and a generous welfare system that tomorrow 's france can ill-afford , as well as increasing divides between the cities and the suburbs , the " haves " and the " have-nots " of french society .
chirac offered rich material for cartoonists " he had a mandate to reform and did not use it .
one of the reasons is that , in some ways , he is a man of another generation , a ' socialist radical ' , a man of the third or fourth republic - a man suspicious of globalisation and of the market , " says moisi .
yet even those who clearly saw mr chirac 's weaknesses throughout his long career agree that the nation still feels a surprising fondness for the loveable rogue who just kept on being elected - even if today 's france , the house that jacques built , is gradually falling apart .
" i 'll miss chirac in the same way you 'd miss your granddad who used to nick the cash you left in the kitchen , " said le monde 's cartoonist plantu .
" he was a nice bloke .
even if when you open the kitchen drawers , you discover they 're empty .
and as for the rest of the house - well , there 's water leaking down the walls of the living room , cracks everywhere , and a hole in the roof .
but jacques chirac was a nice bloke . "

now 74 , mr chirac first became a government minister some 40 years ago and has been a part of french public life ever since for better or for worse .
so what state does he leave france in at home and abroad ?
the young jacques chirac managed to charm voters le monde 's cartoonist plantu , whom mr chirac has provided with endless raw material over the years , said that , in an odd and almost inexplicable way , the french will miss him - even if they are looking forward to having a new generation in the elysee palace .
" jacques chirac will leave his mark as a man the french liked .
it 's incredible , " he said .
" everyone was under his spell .
they all say ' he 's lovely - he 's funny - he 's charming ' and that 's one reason i never wanted to meet him .
" people are strange - because at the same time , they grumble that mr chirac is a crook , and that , as mayor of paris , he cooked the books to help fund his centre-right rpr political party .
" but then they shrug and say : ' ah well , in his position i 'd probably have done the same thing ' . "
scandal-ridden charmer mr chirac has long proved a potent force in french politics - as a handsome young man , cigarette dangling from one hand , a glass of beer in the other , he fought his way into parliament in the rural constituency of correze .
he charmed the french people into voting for him with his ability to empathise and press the flesh with conviction , whether with farmers , young women or business leaders .
chirac : like a granddad who nicks your money , says cartoonist plantu his first ministerial job was back in 1967 , under georges pompidou , and there are few government positions he has not held at one time or another .
later , as mayor of paris for almost two decades from 1977 to 1995 , he was dogged by scandal over party financing and personal expenses , with his closest ally alain juppe being convicted a few years ago of using parisian taxpayers ' money to fund rpr party workers disguised as town hall employees .
but that did not stop jacques chirac winning the presidency in 1995 , taking over at the elysee palace from francois mitterrand to cheers and jubilation on the right , after beating the socialist lionel jospin .
he won again in 2002 , against all the odds and the hostile opinion polls , thanks to mr le pen 's shock entry into the second round .

now 74 , mr chirac first became a government minister some 40 years ago and has been a part of french public life ever since for better or for worse .
so what state does he leave france in at home and abroad ?
the young jacques chirac managed to charm voters le monde 's cartoonist plantu , whom mr chirac has provided with endless raw material over the years , said that , in an odd and almost inexplicable way , the french will miss him - even if they are looking forward to having a new generation in the elysee palace .
" jacques chirac will leave his mark as a man the french liked .
it 's incredible , " he said .
" everyone was under his spell .
they all say ' he 's lovely - he 's funny - he 's charming ' and that 's one reason i never wanted to meet him .
" people are strange - because at the same time , they grumble that mr chirac is a crook , and that , as mayor of paris , he cooked the books to help fund his centre-right rpr political party .
" but then they shrug and say : ' ah well , in his position i 'd probably have done the same thing ' . "
scandal-ridden charmer mr chirac has long proved a potent force in french politics - as a handsome young man , cigarette dangling from one hand , a glass of beer in the other , he fought his way into parliament in the rural constituency of correze .
he charmed the french people into voting for him with his ability to empathise and press the flesh with conviction , whether with farmers , young women or business leaders .
chirac : like a granddad who nicks your money , says cartoonist plantu his first ministerial job was back in 1967 , under georges pompidou , and there are few government positions he has not held at one time or another .
later , as mayor of paris for almost two decades from 1977 to 1995 , he was dogged by scandal over party financing and personal expenses , with his closest ally alain juppe being convicted a few years ago of using parisian taxpayers ' money to fund rpr party workers disguised as town hall employees .
but that did not stop jacques chirac winning the presidency in 1995 , taking over at the elysee palace from francois mitterrand to cheers and jubilation on the right , after beating the socialist lionel jospin .
he won again in 2002 , against all the odds and the hostile opinion polls , thanks to mr le pen 's shock entry into the second round .
alienation the french sniffed that they had the choice between voting for a crook or voting for a fascist , with some socialist voters pictured going to the polls with pegs on their noses to symbolise their disgust .
mr chirac still won his second and now final term .
mr chirac might face a corruption inquiry after his term ends " there is a certain sense of nostalgia , now the man is nearly out , " said dominique moisi , senior fellow at the ifri foreign affairs institute in paris .
" and a sense of lost opportunity .
he failed to reconcile the french with politics .
there were scandals , there was a sense of alienation between the people and the political centre .
" and , more fundamentally , he failed to reform france or bring france in tune with modernity .
but on the positive side , he will be remembered as the man who said ' no ' to the war in iraq , and the man who reconciled the french with their wwii past .
" but somehow , jacques chirac failed with the present , and succeeded with the past . "
opposing iraq as president , jacques chirac always looked happiest on the world stage , forcibly putting france 's point of view .
he continued president mitterrand 's legacy of seeing africa as france 's backyard , and tried to repair french relations with its former colonies .
on the middle east , he ensured that france remained an influence on its old colonies there - lebanon and syria - while trying to make sure that his nation kept a voice in the middle east peace process .
chirac leaves france in a weaker position in europe , and it 's undeniable that today there is less france in europe and as a result , there is less europe in the world dominique moisi ifri foreign affairs institute profile : jacques chirac and of course , in 2003 , he said " no " to the war in iraq .
that french " no " to the war frayed relations with the us and britain , most of all with president george w bush , leaving bilateral ties in a fragile state for his successor .
mr chirac was long against a world influenced by one global hyper-power , especially a power run by george w bush .
marc epstein , foreign editor of the centrist l 'express magazine , said that at a human level , the two leaders were never destined to be friends .
" you can not imagine two men more different .
mr bush is a reformed alcoholic , who believes in god and preaches at people .
" mr chirac is someone who likes to have a good time , have a few beers , and he is on the record as saying transparency in politics does n't matter .
the two men are polar opposites . "
yet mr chirac also leaves behind tensions over europe .
he liked the idea of the eu - especially a union dominated by france and germany .
but he disliked europe 's enlargement to the east to include nations such as poland and the czech republic , whom he saw as washington and london 's trojan horse , working towards an eu that was more a free market , and less a political counterweight to the might of the us .
2005 also brought its own european humiliation for jacques chirac , when his disgruntled nation said its own firm " non " to the eu constitutional treaty .
" chirac leaves france in a weaker position in europe , and it 's undeniable that today there is less france in europe and as a result , there is less europe in the world , " believes dominique moisi .
but if chirac 's " no " to iraq is still widely admired at home , his domestic triumphs have been few and far between .
loveable rogue after 12 years in power , he leaves behind high unemployment , low economic growth and a generous welfare system that tomorrow 's france can ill-afford , as well as increasing divides between the cities and the suburbs , the " haves " and the " have-nots " of french society .
chirac offered rich material for cartoonists " he had a mandate to reform and did not use it .
one of the reasons is that , in some ways , he is a man of another generation , a ' socialist radical ' , a man of the third or fourth republic - a man suspicious of globalisation and of the market , " says moisi .
yet even those who clearly saw mr chirac 's weaknesses throughout his long career agree that the nation still feels a surprising fondness for the loveable rogue who just kept on being elected - even if today 's france , the house that jacques built , is gradually falling apart .

experts say it could prove useful for astronauts adapting for long-term missions to mars - where a day lasts an extra 40 minutes .
the team , from universities in the us and france , tested the light treatment successfully on 12 volunteers .
the study features in the proceeding of the national academy of sciences .

body clock the contrast between exposure to daylight and night-time darkness is thought to adjust and maintain this clock , which helps makes sure the body is working as effectively as possible at times of day when maximum alertness is required .
scientists already know that it is possible to interfere with the human circadian " pacemaker " by controlling exposure to light .
the latest research project , shared between lyon university in france , and harvard university and medical school in the us , looked at whether it was possible to " fine-tune " these alterations to achieve a precise result .
humans do not have precise 24-hour cycles to begin with , and all of the 12 volunteers had cycles ranging from 23.5 to 24.5 hours .

the researchers said that there were numerous situations in which the ability to do this might be useful .

however , the volunteers in the study were all closeted in a laboratory for more than 60 days in total to avoid unwanted exposure to daylight interfering with the experiment .
professor derk-jan dijk , from the surrey sleep research centre , uk , said the study suggested that circadian cycles could be controlled more precisely - but only in controlled environments in which people can be exposed to precise light levels at the right times of day .
he added : " if you have , for example , shift workers on oil rigs who never see the light of day , or people travelling through space , it may be possible to use these methods .

body clock the contrast between exposure to daylight and night-time darkness is thought to adjust and maintain this clock , which helps makes sure the body is working as effectively as possible at times of day when maximum alertness is required .
scientists already know that it is possible to interfere with the human circadian " pacemaker " by controlling exposure to light .
the latest research project , shared between lyon university in france , and harvard university and medical school in the us , looked at whether it was possible to " fine-tune " these alterations to achieve a precise result .
humans do not have precise 24-hour cycles to begin with , and all of the 12 volunteers had cycles ranging from 23.5 to 24.5 hours .
sleep and circadian disruptions could have serious consequences on the effectiveness , health and safety of astronaut crews researchers , harvard and lyon universities after allowing them to sleep and wake normally for a few days , a new regime was imposed , with artificial " days " produced by a combination of low light and very bright pulses of light near the end of the intended " wakeful " hours .
after 30 days , scientists found that a combination of light brightness and pulses was able to manipulate the circadian rhythm , over time adding approximately one hour to each subject 's day .
the researchers said that there were numerous situations in which the ability to do this might be useful .
" jet-lag , shift work and circadian disorders such as advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes are all associated , to different extents , with a condition where the circadian system is out of synchrony with the light / dark cycle , " the wrote .

however , the volunteers in the study were all closeted in a laboratory for more than 60 days in total to avoid unwanted exposure to daylight interfering with the experiment .
professor derk-jan dijk , from the surrey sleep research centre , uk , said the study suggested that circadian cycles could be controlled more precisely - but only in controlled environments in which people can be exposed to precise light levels at the right times of day .
he added : " if you have , for example , shift workers on oil rigs who never see the light of day , or people travelling through space , it may be possible to use these methods .

the rise on south west trains -lrb- swt -rrb- from sunday affects services coming into london after the rush-hour " peak " .
the liberal democrats have tabled a commons motion condemning the increase as " excessive " and calling for a review of the regulation of rail fares .
transport secretary douglas alexander has said he is limited in what he can do as only peak fares are regulated .
the swt rise means passengers will not get off-peak discounts until much later in the morning .
no case mr alexander told the commons on tuesday : " the fares at off-peak times are not regulated fares .
" although i understand that there was real concern and public interest in the fares that were announced , it is important to emphasise that that those are not fares set by government .
" there must be a degree of flexibility for train companies to set prices against other modes of available transport , but i would urge all train companies to act responsibly when considering the setting of unregulated fares . "
david laws , the lib dem work and pensions spokesman , who has tabled the motion , said the company had failed to " provide an adequate business case " for the decision .
however , swt has insisted that the new prices will bring the company into line with other operators and allow it to " better match demand and pricing " .
examples of the increases , which were first announced in march , include a cheap day return from alton , in hampshire , to london rising from £ 15.80 to £ 19 - a 20.25 % increase .
a bournemouth-to-london cheap day return will go up from £ 36.40 to £ 43.70 - a 20.05 % rise .

his delight at the five-year cruise is chronicled in a letter , available online for the first time .
the note is one of nearly 5,000 from and to the scientist held in a database at the university of cambridge .
the darwin correspondence project includes summaries of a further 9,000 letters , written from the age of 12 .
in some of his earliest letters , he recounts talking to his sister caroline , who had asked him about his personal hygiene .
" i only wash my fe -lsb- e -rsb- t once a month at school , which i confess is nasty , but i can not help it , for we have nothing to do it with , " he wrote .
dr alison pearn , co-director of the darwin correspondence project , says it is insight like this that makes the letters so special .
" i think the human side is what is arresting about the letters , " she said .
" there is such an interesting and exciting mixture of very cutting-edge science and very personal revelations about his life and family . "
different paths darwin was a prolific letter writer , exchanging correspondence with nearly 2,000 people during his lifetime -lrb- 1809-1882 -rrb- .
nearly 14,500 of his letters are known to exist , with the biggest collection residing in cambridge .
his theory on evolution has influenced many science disciplines " letters were absolutely essential to what darwin was doing , " said dr pearn .
" this is how he gathered data , how he gathered ideas , how he discussed ideas . "
as well as other scientists , darwin courted diplomats , clergymen , gardeners and pigeon fanciers .
" pigeons are one of the organisms that darwin investigated in great detail , in particular to study variation under domestication , " said dr pearn .
" breeding was so wide spread at the time that it was easy for him to tap into a network of people . "
the letters also detail his dealings with other intellectual heavyweights of the time .
these included well known naturalists such as alfred russel wallace , who collected specimens in the amazon and malay archipelago and independently formulated a theory of evolution by natural selection .
in a letter from may 1857 , contained in the new archive , darwin replied to wallace who had reported some of his own conclusions in the annals and magazine of natural history and in a letter sent to darwin on 10 october 1856 .
" i can plainly see that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions , " wrote darwin .
darwin was one of the most important figures in the history of science .
he changed forever our understanding of life on earth .
john van wyhe darwin online " i agree to the truth of almost every word of your paper ; and i daresay that you will agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any theoretical paper ; for it is lamentable how each man draws his own different conclusions from the very same fact . "
darwin and wallace eventually published their theories in a joint paper in 1858 , a year before darwin published on the origin of species .
letters from throughout this period map out the evolution of his ideas and publications .
complete collection the darwin correspondence project has existed offline since 1974 .
it has so far published 15 volumes of the scientist 's letters as books .
the beagle set off for south america in 1831 an agreement with the publisher of the books means the new website will offer digitised versions of the texts freely available to anyone four years behind the hard copies .
nearly 5,000 pieces of correspondence will be fully searchable when the site launches on thursday 17 may .

his delight at the five-year cruise is chronicled in a letter , available online for the first time .
the note is one of nearly 5,000 from and to the scientist held in a database at the university of cambridge .
the darwin correspondence project includes summaries of a further 9,000 letters , written from the age of 12 .
in some of his earliest letters , he recounts talking to his sister caroline , who had asked him about his personal hygiene .
" i only wash my fe -lsb- e -rsb- t once a month at school , which i confess is nasty , but i can not help it , for we have nothing to do it with , " he wrote .
dr alison pearn , co-director of the darwin correspondence project , says it is insight like this that makes the letters so special .
" i think the human side is what is arresting about the letters , " she said .
" there is such an interesting and exciting mixture of very cutting-edge science and very personal revelations about his life and family . "
different paths darwin was a prolific letter writer , exchanging correspondence with nearly 2,000 people during his lifetime -lrb- 1809-1882 -rrb- .
nearly 14,500 of his letters are known to exist , with the biggest collection residing in cambridge .
his theory on evolution has influenced many science disciplines " letters were absolutely essential to what darwin was doing , " said dr pearn .
" this is how he gathered data , how he gathered ideas , how he discussed ideas . "
as well as other scientists , darwin courted diplomats , clergymen , gardeners and pigeon fanciers .
" pigeons are one of the organisms that darwin investigated in great detail , in particular to study variation under domestication , " said dr pearn .
" breeding was so wide spread at the time that it was easy for him to tap into a network of people . "
the letters also detail his dealings with other intellectual heavyweights of the time .
these included well known naturalists such as alfred russel wallace , who collected specimens in the amazon and malay archipelago and independently formulated a theory of evolution by natural selection .
in a letter from may 1857 , contained in the new archive , darwin replied to wallace who had reported some of his own conclusions in the annals and magazine of natural history and in a letter sent to darwin on 10 october 1856 .
" i can plainly see that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions , " wrote darwin .
darwin was one of the most important figures in the history of science .
he changed forever our understanding of life on earth .
john van wyhe darwin online " i agree to the truth of almost every word of your paper ; and i daresay that you will agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any theoretical paper ; for it is lamentable how each man draws his own different conclusions from the very same fact . "
darwin and wallace eventually published their theories in a joint paper in 1858 , a year before darwin published on the origin of species .
letters from throughout this period map out the evolution of his ideas and publications .
complete collection the darwin correspondence project has existed offline since 1974 .
it has so far published 15 volumes of the scientist 's letters as books .
the beagle set off for south america in 1831 an agreement with the publisher of the books means the new website will offer digitised versions of the texts freely available to anyone four years behind the hard copies .
nearly 5,000 pieces of correspondence will be fully searchable when the site launches on thursday 17 may .

according to the office for national statistics , the number of unemployed rose by 13,000 to 1.7 million in the three months between january and march .
however , the report also showed that the number of people claiming jobless benefit dipped by 15,700 to 890,000 .
analysts said that the figures would do little to ease concerns that labour shortages may buoy wages and inflation .
' mixed data ' last week the bank of england raised its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.5 % as it looked to slow price growth .
financial markets had been hoping that wednesday 's unemployment figures would give a clue to the inflationary pressures that would affect the job market in coming months .
in the event , the numbers failed to deliver a conclusive signal one way or the other .
