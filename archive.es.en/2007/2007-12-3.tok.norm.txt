germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .
but some europeans suspect that washington is not overly concerned with the weakness of its currency , as it has helped us exporters . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .
merkel critical of spd 's move left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to distance itself from its political rivals on the left merkel attacked the spd 's decision in october to reverse a key job market reform .
the spd shifted to the left at its party congress in hamburg in an attempt to win back support lost to the left party .
merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .
conservative values remain central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't see turkey entering the eu merkel has said she wants to create a " society of opportunity " and use a big-tent approach to the party 's vision .
analysts also expect the hanover congress to restate core cdu values and policies .
merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
she said she was opposed to the introduction of an " across-the-board " minimum wage . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , where vladimir putin ’ s united russia party won a two-thirds majority .
but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .

" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .
merkel critical of spd 's move left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to distance itself from its political rivals on the left merkel attacked the spd 's decision in october to reverse a key job market reform .
the spd shifted to the left at its party congress in hamburg in an attempt to win back support lost to the left party .
merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .
conservative values remain central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't see turkey entering the eu merkel has said she wants to create a " society of opportunity " and use a big-tent approach to the party 's vision .
analysts also expect the hanover congress to restate core cdu values and policies .
merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
she said she was opposed to the introduction of an " across-the-board " minimum wage . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

2 , where vladimir putin ’ s united russia party won a two-thirds majority .
but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .
merkel critical of spd 's move left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to distance itself from its political rivals on the left merkel attacked the spd 's decision in october to reverse a key job market reform .
the spd shifted to the left at its party congress in hamburg in an attempt to win back support lost to the left party .
merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .
conservative values remain central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't see turkey entering the eu merkel has said she wants to create a " society of opportunity " and use a big-tent approach to the party 's vision .
analysts also expect the hanover congress to restate core cdu values and policies .
merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
she said she was opposed to the introduction of an " across-the-board " minimum wage . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .
she said she hoped russia would move towards allowing more different opinions . dw staff -lrb- ktz / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .

" after intensive efforts made during the past 120 days in finding common points , i think there are no additional options that would lead towards a kosovo status solution based on compromise , " eu mediator wolfgang ischinger told the belgrade daily , blic . ischinger also said that the troika 's report does not include any proposals defining the serbian province 's future status . serbian officials meanwhile continued to express optimism for continuation of the kosovo status talks . " we believe that the negotiation process does not end with the report of the troika , rather , that it is yet another phase , more successful than the last , " said serbian kosovo minister slobodan samardzic . independence a possible scenario ischinger , along with us envoy frank wisner and russian envoy alexander botsan-kharchenko , made a final visit to belgrade and kosovo to brief rival serbs and kosovo albanians on their report following four months of talks . the final report is due to be handed to un secretary general ban ki-moon on december 10 . the leaders of kosovo 's albanian majority have said they will proclaim the region 's independence soon after this date .
serbia is only prepared to grant autonomy styled after the model of hong kong or finland 's aland islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger speaking to blic , ischinger said that a " possible scenario " would be that the leaders of kosovo albanians unilaterally declare independence . " my impression is that this step shall be coordinated with the eu , us and other countries .
one thing is clear : the status quo is unsustainable and a decision is necessary . " ischinger said that as regards the question of how the international community should act towards kosovo after december 10 would be answered differently in the capitals of the eu , russia and the us . only russia supported serbia 's view that kosovo should formally remain its province . washington was in favor of kosovo going independent under international supervision , a plan also endorsed by most eu nations , although the 27-nation bloc failed to reach a consensus . international community fears violence the international community is fearful that a declaration of independence could reignite tensions , resulting in violence .
last week , nato reinforced its 17,000-strong kfor peacekeeping mission in kosovo with us and german troops . however , ischinger told journalists that both serbian and kosovo albanian leaders have pledged to refrain from resorting to violence .
" that is very important for the road ahead , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .

merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .

merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .

but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone .

the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .

the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem .

the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem .

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .
merkel critical of spd 's move left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to distance itself from its political rivals on the left merkel attacked the spd 's decision in october to reverse a key job market reform .
the spd shifted to the left at its party congress in hamburg in an attempt to win back support lost to the left party .
merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .
conservative values remain central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't see turkey entering the eu merkel has said she wants to create a " society of opportunity " and use a big-tent approach to the party 's vision .
analysts also expect the hanover congress to restate core cdu values and policies .
merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
she said she was opposed to the introduction of an " across-the-board " minimum wage . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .

they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair .

" putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .

the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .
she said she hoped russia would move towards allowing more different opinions . dw staff -lrb- ktz / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .
seven other parties failed to reach the 7-percent minimum , which was raised from 5 percent prior to the elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called on the russian public to cast their ballots for united russia shortly after the vote , the united states government called for a probe to investigate claims of vote-rigging , while nikolai konkin , deputy chairman of the elections committee , promised that " all complaints and allegations will be carefully examined . " the head of russia 's election commission , however , said on monday that there were no major violations at the country 's parliamentary polls , interfax reported . opposition criticizes abuse but accusations were rife among all 11 parties participating in the vote .
they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station .

" they 're raping the democratic system . " in the days and weeks ahead of the dec .

kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair . " the state duma election in the russian federation on the 2nd december 2007 was not fair and failed to meet many osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , " the joint observer mission said in a statement . allegations were made that voters were bribed with televisions and refrigerators to vote for the incumbent party and a report came from st. petersburg that groups of people were bussed from one polling station to another to cast multiple votes . " these are not isolated incidents , " said grigory melkonyans , also of golos .
" the complaints are from every corner of russia . " turnout was high among the country 's 109 million registered voters , with more than 60 percent casting their ballots .

it is the first since introducing new rules raising the representational threshold for entering the duma from five to seven percent . t est-run for march presidential election ? the leader of president vladimir putin 's united russia party said a strong showing in sunday 's parliamentary election was a personal victory for putin .
the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .

" the vote means that vladimir putin is our national leader .
his politics will be carried forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabitz cornelia putin ran as the top candidate for united russia , and the kremlin characterized the election as a presidential referendum .
after two terms in office , putin is not eligible to run as president in the elections next year .
but experts said his clear majority in parliament could lead to a change in the law to give additional powers to another position , which putin would then occupy .
in the run up to the elections , putin himself said that a clear election victory would give him a " moral " mandate to continue a leadership role in the future government . the results have been tallied and the russian people have provided the wished-for conclusion .
in putin 's russia , politics has become a pompous staging ground marked by kremlin intrigue and opaque maneuverings .
as much as possible , it 's important to try and look behind the scenes .
yet when the curtain gets pulled back , it becomes clear that political pluralism is only a front in russia .
the so-called " kremlin parties " have a two-thirds majority in russia .
the communists provide the only real opposition , which is a ludicrous idea . democracy is the undisputed loser of this stage-managed election .
in particular , the democratic institutions , above all the parliament , have been converted into a docile instrument in the hands of those in power in the kremlin . the other losers in this election are the russian opposition , which found itself marginalized and divided in an attempt to win against this new social trend .
opposition leaders should not count on help from outside russia . russian voters showed that they want stability and prosperity and fear chaos .
their motives and fears should be taken seriously .
voters knowingly strengthened putin , a person who considers democracy a facade . but the election left an important question unanswered : what will become of vladimir putin ?
vladimir putin proved that electoral manipulations and the injustice as well as lies and personality cult would not change the election outcome . does putin have a master plan for retaining power ?
if left out of the presidential race , what position will he use to influence russia 's future ?
there are no answers , nor even hints .
russia is ruled with smokescreens and camouflage and is dominated by and increasingly authoritarian ghost .
the voters only applaud his power . germany , europe and the world are unfortunately observers of this power play .
they can criticize , but they know that their threats are meaningless .
it 's clear that russia 's political involvement is very important in several areas .
it would be counterproductive for europe to cut off contact , close down business ties and freeze engagement . change and democratic improvement in russia will only come from inside the country .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aerospace -pipe- 03.12.2007 airbus head calls for production move to united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has no choice but to head to the us to remain competitive , a company head said building aircraft in the euro zone is becoming financially impossible , said the head of airbus .
the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .
but some europeans suspect that washington is not overly concerned with the weakness of its currency , as it has helped us exporters . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "

this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem .

2 , which were marred by allegations of manipulation at the polls . with ballots counted monday morning from nearly 98 percent of the precincts , united russia , the incumbent party , had claimed 64.1 percent of the vote . following united russia was the communist party with just under 12 percent .
the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .
seven other parties failed to reach the 7-percent minimum , which was raised from 5 percent prior to the elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called on the russian public to cast their ballots for united russia shortly after the vote , the united states government called for a probe to investigate claims of vote-rigging , while nikolai konkin , deputy chairman of the elections committee , promised that " all complaints and allegations will be carefully examined . " the head of russia 's election commission , however , said on monday that there were no major violations at the country 's parliamentary polls , interfax reported . opposition criticizes abuse but accusations were rife among all 11 parties participating in the vote .
they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station . " the fact is they 're not just rigging the vote , " he said .
" they 're raping the democratic system . " in the days and weeks ahead of the dec .
2 vote , the kremlin clamped down on opposition organizations , breaking up rallies and raiding party headquarters .
kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair . " the state duma election in the russian federation on the 2nd december 2007 was not fair and failed to meet many osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , " the joint observer mission said in a statement . allegations were made that voters were bribed with televisions and refrigerators to vote for the incumbent party and a report came from st. petersburg that groups of people were bussed from one polling station to another to cast multiple votes . " these are not isolated incidents , " said grigory melkonyans , also of golos .
" the complaints are from every corner of russia . " turnout was high among the country 's 109 million registered voters , with more than 60 percent casting their ballots .
the dec .
2 vote was the fifth parliamentary election since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
it is the first since introducing new rules raising the representational threshold for entering the duma from five to seven percent . t est-run for march presidential election ? the leader of president vladimir putin 's united russia party said a strong showing in sunday 's parliamentary election was a personal victory for putin .
the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .
she said she hoped russia would move towards allowing more different opinions . dw staff -lrb- ktz / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , where vladimir putin ’ s united russia party won a two-thirds majority .
but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

2 , which were marred by allegations of manipulation at the polls . with ballots counted monday morning from nearly 98 percent of the precincts , united russia , the incumbent party , had claimed 64.1 percent of the vote . following united russia was the communist party with just under 12 percent .
the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .
seven other parties failed to reach the 7-percent minimum , which was raised from 5 percent prior to the elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called on the russian public to cast their ballots for united russia shortly after the vote , the united states government called for a probe to investigate claims of vote-rigging , while nikolai konkin , deputy chairman of the elections committee , promised that " all complaints and allegations will be carefully examined . " the head of russia 's election commission , however , said on monday that there were no major violations at the country 's parliamentary polls , interfax reported . opposition criticizes abuse but accusations were rife among all 11 parties participating in the vote .
they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station . " the fact is they 're not just rigging the vote , " he said .
" they 're raping the democratic system . " in the days and weeks ahead of the dec .
2 vote , the kremlin clamped down on opposition organizations , breaking up rallies and raiding party headquarters .
kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair . " the state duma election in the russian federation on the 2nd december 2007 was not fair and failed to meet many osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , " the joint observer mission said in a statement . allegations were made that voters were bribed with televisions and refrigerators to vote for the incumbent party and a report came from st. petersburg that groups of people were bussed from one polling station to another to cast multiple votes . " these are not isolated incidents , " said grigory melkonyans , also of golos .
" the complaints are from every corner of russia . " turnout was high among the country 's 109 million registered voters , with more than 60 percent casting their ballots .
the dec .
2 vote was the fifth parliamentary election since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
it is the first since introducing new rules raising the representational threshold for entering the duma from five to seven percent . t est-run for march presidential election ? the leader of president vladimir putin 's united russia party said a strong showing in sunday 's parliamentary election was a personal victory for putin .
the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .

" uefa introduced , over one year ago , an early warning system in order to monitor irregular betting activities , and agreed to work together with the appropriate police authorities , " europe 's international soccer association said in a statement . platini added that the organization was investigating 15 games in cooperation with europol and that the possibility of match-fixing by asian betting syndicates in top-flight european soccer had also come up in a november conference on violence in sports . five uefa officials visited the europol headquarters in the hague in early november to hand over a 96-page dossier outlining suspicions that games were being fixed , according to the magazine . strange betting patterns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa said the scandal did not include euro 2008 qualifiers " we need to find striking evidence before we can initiate disciplinary procedures , " said william gaillard , uefa 's director of communications .

others may have something behind it . " the uefa report covered a total of 26 games , including three in the third preliminary round of the champions league , two in the uefa cup and one in the qualifiers for euro 2008 .
fifteen of the suspect games were played during the current season with the other 11 between july 2005 and november 2006 , der spiegel said . teams involved came mainly from the balkans , as well as eastern and southern europe and betting sums were reported to be in the millions , most of which reportedly flowed to asian betting syndicates . front for money laundering ? peter limacher , head of uefa 's disciplinary commission , said there is also a concern that the gambling is being used to launder money . " when large amounts of money are bet at odds of 1 euro to 1.05 euros " it 's not about profits but about getting " clean " money , he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . platini told welt am sonntag that the uefa has decided to organize a conference with the eu in 2008 about corruption and money-laundering in the sport .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , which were marred by allegations of manipulation at the polls . with ballots counted monday morning from nearly 98 percent of the precincts , united russia , the incumbent party , had claimed 64.1 percent of the vote . following united russia was the communist party with just under 12 percent .
the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .
seven other parties failed to reach the 7-percent minimum , which was raised from 5 percent prior to the elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called on the russian public to cast their ballots for united russia shortly after the vote , the united states government called for a probe to investigate claims of vote-rigging , while nikolai konkin , deputy chairman of the elections committee , promised that " all complaints and allegations will be carefully examined . " the head of russia 's election commission , however , said on monday that there were no major violations at the country 's parliamentary polls , interfax reported . opposition criticizes abuse but accusations were rife among all 11 parties participating in the vote .
they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station . " the fact is they 're not just rigging the vote , " he said .
" they 're raping the democratic system . " in the days and weeks ahead of the dec .
2 vote , the kremlin clamped down on opposition organizations , breaking up rallies and raiding party headquarters .
kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair . " the state duma election in the russian federation on the 2nd december 2007 was not fair and failed to meet many osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , " the joint observer mission said in a statement . allegations were made that voters were bribed with televisions and refrigerators to vote for the incumbent party and a report came from st. petersburg that groups of people were bussed from one polling station to another to cast multiple votes . " these are not isolated incidents , " said grigory melkonyans , also of golos .
" the complaints are from every corner of russia . " turnout was high among the country 's 109 million registered voters , with more than 60 percent casting their ballots .
the dec .
2 vote was the fifth parliamentary election since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
it is the first since introducing new rules raising the representational threshold for entering the duma from five to seven percent . t est-run for march presidential election ? the leader of president vladimir putin 's united russia party said a strong showing in sunday 's parliamentary election was a personal victory for putin .
the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .

the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station . " the fact is they 're not just rigging the vote , " he said .
" they 're raping the democratic system . " in the days and weeks ahead of the dec .
2 vote , the kremlin clamped down on opposition organizations , breaking up rallies and raiding party headquarters .
kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair . " the state duma election in the russian federation on the 2nd december 2007 was not fair and failed to meet many osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , " the joint observer mission said in a statement . allegations were made that voters were bribed with televisions and refrigerators to vote for the incumbent party and a report came from st. petersburg that groups of people were bussed from one polling station to another to cast multiple votes . " these are not isolated incidents , " said grigory melkonyans , also of golos .
" the complaints are from every corner of russia . " turnout was high among the country 's 109 million registered voters , with more than 60 percent casting their ballots .
the dec .
2 vote was the fifth parliamentary election since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
it is the first since introducing new rules raising the representational threshold for entering the duma from five to seven percent . t est-run for march presidential election ? the leader of president vladimir putin 's united russia party said a strong showing in sunday 's parliamentary election was a personal victory for putin .
the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .
she said she hoped russia would move towards allowing more different opinions . dw staff -lrb- ktz / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .

merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .

" the vote means that vladimir putin is our national leader .
his politics will be carried forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabitz cornelia putin ran as the top candidate for united russia , and the kremlin characterized the election as a presidential referendum .
after two terms in office , putin is not eligible to run as president in the elections next year .
but experts said his clear majority in parliament could lead to a change in the law to give additional powers to another position , which putin would then occupy .
in the run up to the elections , putin himself said that a clear election victory would give him a " moral " mandate to continue a leadership role in the future government . the results have been tallied and the russian people have provided the wished-for conclusion .
in putin 's russia , politics has become a pompous staging ground marked by kremlin intrigue and opaque maneuverings .
as much as possible , it 's important to try and look behind the scenes .
yet when the curtain gets pulled back , it becomes clear that political pluralism is only a front in russia .
the so-called " kremlin parties " have a two-thirds majority in russia .
the communists provide the only real opposition , which is a ludicrous idea . democracy is the undisputed loser of this stage-managed election .
in particular , the democratic institutions , above all the parliament , have been converted into a docile instrument in the hands of those in power in the kremlin . the other losers in this election are the russian opposition , which found itself marginalized and divided in an attempt to win against this new social trend .
opposition leaders should not count on help from outside russia . russian voters showed that they want stability and prosperity and fear chaos .
their motives and fears should be taken seriously .
voters knowingly strengthened putin , a person who considers democracy a facade . but the election left an important question unanswered : what will become of vladimir putin ?
vladimir putin proved that electoral manipulations and the injustice as well as lies and personality cult would not change the election outcome . does putin have a master plan for retaining power ?
if left out of the presidential race , what position will he use to influence russia 's future ?
there are no answers , nor even hints .
russia is ruled with smokescreens and camouflage and is dominated by and increasingly authoritarian ghost .
the voters only applaud his power . germany , europe and the world are unfortunately observers of this power play .
they can criticize , but they know that their threats are meaningless .
it 's clear that russia 's political involvement is very important in several areas .
it would be counterproductive for europe to cut off contact , close down business ties and freeze engagement . change and democratic improvement in russia will only come from inside the country .
the parliamentary election has shown that this road remains a very long one . cornelia rabitz is the director of dw-radio 's russia program -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his politics will be carried forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabitz cornelia putin ran as the top candidate for united russia , and the kremlin characterized the election as a presidential referendum .
after two terms in office , putin is not eligible to run as president in the elections next year .
but experts said his clear majority in parliament could lead to a change in the law to give additional powers to another position , which putin would then occupy .
in the run up to the elections , putin himself said that a clear election victory would give him a " moral " mandate to continue a leadership role in the future government . the results have been tallied and the russian people have provided the wished-for conclusion .
in putin 's russia , politics has become a pompous staging ground marked by kremlin intrigue and opaque maneuverings .
as much as possible , it 's important to try and look behind the scenes .
yet when the curtain gets pulled back , it becomes clear that political pluralism is only a front in russia .
the so-called " kremlin parties " have a two-thirds majority in russia .
the communists provide the only real opposition , which is a ludicrous idea . democracy is the undisputed loser of this stage-managed election .
in particular , the democratic institutions , above all the parliament , have been converted into a docile instrument in the hands of those in power in the kremlin . the other losers in this election are the russian opposition , which found itself marginalized and divided in an attempt to win against this new social trend .
opposition leaders should not count on help from outside russia . russian voters showed that they want stability and prosperity and fear chaos .
their motives and fears should be taken seriously .
voters knowingly strengthened putin , a person who considers democracy a facade . but the election left an important question unanswered : what will become of vladimir putin ?
vladimir putin proved that electoral manipulations and the injustice as well as lies and personality cult would not change the election outcome . does putin have a master plan for retaining power ?
if left out of the presidential race , what position will he use to influence russia 's future ?
there are no answers , nor even hints .
russia is ruled with smokescreens and camouflage and is dominated by and increasingly authoritarian ghost .
the voters only applaud his power . germany , europe and the world are unfortunately observers of this power play .
they can criticize , but they know that their threats are meaningless .
it 's clear that russia 's political involvement is very important in several areas .
it would be counterproductive for europe to cut off contact , close down business ties and freeze engagement . change and democratic improvement in russia will only come from inside the country .
the parliamentary election has shown that this road remains a very long one . cornelia rabitz is the director of dw-radio 's russia program -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uefa president michel platini has confirmed that european soccer 's governing body and police are investigating match-fixing in 15 top-level matches . " uefa introduced , over one year ago , an early warning system in order to monitor irregular betting activities , and agreed to work together with the appropriate police authorities , " europe 's international soccer association said in a statement . platini added that the organization was investigating 15 games in cooperation with europol and that the possibility of match-fixing by asian betting syndicates in top-flight european soccer had also come up in a november conference on violence in sports . five uefa officials visited the europol headquarters in the hague in early november to hand over a 96-page dossier outlining suspicions that games were being fixed , according to the magazine . strange betting patterns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa said the scandal did not include euro 2008 qualifiers " we need to find striking evidence before we can initiate disciplinary procedures , " said william gaillard , uefa 's director of communications .
" some of these strange patterns may be strange patterns and that 's it .
others may have something behind it . " the uefa report covered a total of 26 games , including three in the third preliminary round of the champions league , two in the uefa cup and one in the qualifiers for euro 2008 .
fifteen of the suspect games were played during the current season with the other 11 between july 2005 and november 2006 , der spiegel said . teams involved came mainly from the balkans , as well as eastern and southern europe and betting sums were reported to be in the millions , most of which reportedly flowed to asian betting syndicates . front for money laundering ? peter limacher , head of uefa 's disciplinary commission , said there is also a concern that the gambling is being used to launder money . " when large amounts of money are bet at odds of 1 euro to 1.05 euros " it 's not about profits but about getting " clean " money , he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . platini told welt am sonntag that the uefa has decided to organize a conference with the eu in 2008 about corruption and money-laundering in the sport . " i love soccer and we must protect it with everything in our power , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .

merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .

in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .

merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .
merkel critical of spd 's move left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to distance itself from its political rivals on the left merkel attacked the spd 's decision in october to reverse a key job market reform .
the spd shifted to the left at its party congress in hamburg in an attempt to win back support lost to the left party .
merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .
conservative values remain central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't see turkey entering the eu merkel has said she wants to create a " society of opportunity " and use a big-tent approach to the party 's vision .
analysts also expect the hanover congress to restate core cdu values and policies .
merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .

but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

" after intensive efforts made during the past 120 days in finding common points , i think there are no additional options that would lead towards a kosovo status solution based on compromise , " eu mediator wolfgang ischinger told the belgrade daily , blic . ischinger also said that the troika 's report does not include any proposals defining the serbian province 's future status . serbian officials meanwhile continued to express optimism for continuation of the kosovo status talks . " we believe that the negotiation process does not end with the report of the troika , rather , that it is yet another phase , more successful than the last , " said serbian kosovo minister slobodan samardzic . independence a possible scenario ischinger , along with us envoy frank wisner and russian envoy alexander botsan-kharchenko , made a final visit to belgrade and kosovo to brief rival serbs and kosovo albanians on their report following four months of talks . the final report is due to be handed to un secretary general ban ki-moon on december 10 . the leaders of kosovo 's albanian majority have said they will proclaim the region 's independence soon after this date .

" my impression is that this step shall be coordinated with the eu , us and other countries .
one thing is clear : the status quo is unsustainable and a decision is necessary . " ischinger said that as regards the question of how the international community should act towards kosovo after december 10 would be answered differently in the capitals of the eu , russia and the us . only russia supported serbia 's view that kosovo should formally remain its province . washington was in favor of kosovo going independent under international supervision , a plan also endorsed by most eu nations , although the 27-nation bloc failed to reach a consensus . international community fears violence the international community is fearful that a declaration of independence could reignite tensions , resulting in violence .
last week , nato reinforced its 17,000-strong kfor peacekeeping mission in kosovo with us and german troops . however , ischinger told journalists that both serbian and kosovo albanian leaders have pledged to refrain from resorting to violence .

2 , which were marred by allegations of manipulation at the polls . with ballots counted monday morning from nearly 98 percent of the precincts , united russia , the incumbent party , had claimed 64.1 percent of the vote . following united russia was the communist party with just under 12 percent .
the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .
seven other parties failed to reach the 7-percent minimum , which was raised from 5 percent prior to the elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called on the russian public to cast their ballots for united russia shortly after the vote , the united states government called for a probe to investigate claims of vote-rigging , while nikolai konkin , deputy chairman of the elections committee , promised that " all complaints and allegations will be carefully examined . " the head of russia 's election commission , however , said on monday that there were no major violations at the country 's parliamentary polls , interfax reported . opposition criticizes abuse but accusations were rife among all 11 parties participating in the vote .
they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station . " the fact is they 're not just rigging the vote , " he said .
" they 're raping the democratic system . " in the days and weeks ahead of the dec .
2 vote , the kremlin clamped down on opposition organizations , breaking up rallies and raiding party headquarters .
kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair . " the state duma election in the russian federation on the 2nd december 2007 was not fair and failed to meet many osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , " the joint observer mission said in a statement . allegations were made that voters were bribed with televisions and refrigerators to vote for the incumbent party and a report came from st. petersburg that groups of people were bussed from one polling station to another to cast multiple votes . " these are not isolated incidents , " said grigory melkonyans , also of golos .
" the complaints are from every corner of russia . " turnout was high among the country 's 109 million registered voters , with more than 60 percent casting their ballots .
the dec .
2 vote was the fifth parliamentary election since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
it is the first since introducing new rules raising the representational threshold for entering the duma from five to seven percent . t est-run for march presidential election ? the leader of president vladimir putin 's united russia party said a strong showing in sunday 's parliamentary election was a personal victory for putin .
the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .
she said she hoped russia would move towards allowing more different opinions . dw staff -lrb- ktz / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .

" after intensive efforts made during the past 120 days in finding common points , i think there are no additional options that would lead towards a kosovo status solution based on compromise , " eu mediator wolfgang ischinger told the belgrade daily , blic . ischinger also said that the troika 's report does not include any proposals defining the serbian province 's future status . serbian officials meanwhile continued to express optimism for continuation of the kosovo status talks . " we believe that the negotiation process does not end with the report of the troika , rather , that it is yet another phase , more successful than the last , " said serbian kosovo minister slobodan samardzic . independence a possible scenario ischinger , along with us envoy frank wisner and russian envoy alexander botsan-kharchenko , made a final visit to belgrade and kosovo to brief rival serbs and kosovo albanians on their report following four months of talks . the final report is due to be handed to un secretary general ban ki-moon on december 10 . the leaders of kosovo 's albanian majority have said they will proclaim the region 's independence soon after this date .
serbia is only prepared to grant autonomy styled after the model of hong kong or finland 's aland islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger speaking to blic , ischinger said that a " possible scenario " would be that the leaders of kosovo albanians unilaterally declare independence . " my impression is that this step shall be coordinated with the eu , us and other countries .
one thing is clear : the status quo is unsustainable and a decision is necessary . " ischinger said that as regards the question of how the international community should act towards kosovo after december 10 would be answered differently in the capitals of the eu , russia and the us . only russia supported serbia 's view that kosovo should formally remain its province . washington was in favor of kosovo going independent under international supervision , a plan also endorsed by most eu nations , although the 27-nation bloc failed to reach a consensus . international community fears violence the international community is fearful that a declaration of independence could reignite tensions , resulting in violence .
last week , nato reinforced its 17,000-strong kfor peacekeeping mission in kosovo with us and german troops . however , ischinger told journalists that both serbian and kosovo albanian leaders have pledged to refrain from resorting to violence .
" that is very important for the road ahead , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , where vladimir putin ’ s united russia party won a two-thirds majority .
but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .
merkel critical of spd 's move left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to distance itself from its political rivals on the left merkel attacked the spd 's decision in october to reverse a key job market reform .
the spd shifted to the left at its party congress in hamburg in an attempt to win back support lost to the left party .
merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .
conservative values remain central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't see turkey entering the eu merkel has said she wants to create a " society of opportunity " and use a big-tent approach to the party 's vision .
analysts also expect the hanover congress to restate core cdu values and policies .
merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .

merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .

in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "

merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .

uefa president michel platini has confirmed that european soccer 's governing body and police are investigating match-fixing in 15 top-level matches . " uefa introduced , over one year ago , an early warning system in order to monitor irregular betting activities , and agreed to work together with the appropriate police authorities , " europe 's international soccer association said in a statement . platini added that the organization was investigating 15 games in cooperation with europol and that the possibility of match-fixing by asian betting syndicates in top-flight european soccer had also come up in a november conference on violence in sports . five uefa officials visited the europol headquarters in the hague in early november to hand over a 96-page dossier outlining suspicions that games were being fixed , according to the magazine . strange betting patterns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa said the scandal did not include euro 2008 qualifiers " we need to find striking evidence before we can initiate disciplinary procedures , " said william gaillard , uefa 's director of communications .
" some of these strange patterns may be strange patterns and that 's it .
others may have something behind it . " the uefa report covered a total of 26 games , including three in the third preliminary round of the champions league , two in the uefa cup and one in the qualifiers for euro 2008 .
fifteen of the suspect games were played during the current season with the other 11 between july 2005 and november 2006 , der spiegel said . teams involved came mainly from the balkans , as well as eastern and southern europe and betting sums were reported to be in the millions , most of which reportedly flowed to asian betting syndicates . front for money laundering ? peter limacher , head of uefa 's disciplinary commission , said there is also a concern that the gambling is being used to launder money . " when large amounts of money are bet at odds of 1 euro to 1.05 euros " it 's not about profits but about getting " clean " money , he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . platini told welt am sonntag that the uefa has decided to organize a conference with the eu in 2008 about corruption and money-laundering in the sport .

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .

" after intensive efforts made during the past 120 days in finding common points , i think there are no additional options that would lead towards a kosovo status solution based on compromise , " eu mediator wolfgang ischinger told the belgrade daily , blic . ischinger also said that the troika 's report does not include any proposals defining the serbian province 's future status . serbian officials meanwhile continued to express optimism for continuation of the kosovo status talks . " we believe that the negotiation process does not end with the report of the troika , rather , that it is yet another phase , more successful than the last , " said serbian kosovo minister slobodan samardzic . independence a possible scenario ischinger , along with us envoy frank wisner and russian envoy alexander botsan-kharchenko , made a final visit to belgrade and kosovo to brief rival serbs and kosovo albanians on their report following four months of talks . the final report is due to be handed to un secretary general ban ki-moon on december 10 . the leaders of kosovo 's albanian majority have said they will proclaim the region 's independence soon after this date .
serbia is only prepared to grant autonomy styled after the model of hong kong or finland 's aland islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger speaking to blic , ischinger said that a " possible scenario " would be that the leaders of kosovo albanians unilaterally declare independence . " my impression is that this step shall be coordinated with the eu , us and other countries .
one thing is clear : the status quo is unsustainable and a decision is necessary . " ischinger said that as regards the question of how the international community should act towards kosovo after december 10 would be answered differently in the capitals of the eu , russia and the us . only russia supported serbia 's view that kosovo should formally remain its province . washington was in favor of kosovo going independent under international supervision , a plan also endorsed by most eu nations , although the 27-nation bloc failed to reach a consensus . international community fears violence the international community is fearful that a declaration of independence could reignite tensions , resulting in violence .
last week , nato reinforced its 17,000-strong kfor peacekeeping mission in kosovo with us and german troops . however , ischinger told journalists that both serbian and kosovo albanian leaders have pledged to refrain from resorting to violence .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after intensive efforts made during the past 120 days in finding common points , i think there are no additional options that would lead towards a kosovo status solution based on compromise , " eu mediator wolfgang ischinger told the belgrade daily , blic . ischinger also said that the troika 's report does not include any proposals defining the serbian province 's future status . serbian officials meanwhile continued to express optimism for continuation of the kosovo status talks . " we believe that the negotiation process does not end with the report of the troika , rather , that it is yet another phase , more successful than the last , " said serbian kosovo minister slobodan samardzic . independence a possible scenario ischinger , along with us envoy frank wisner and russian envoy alexander botsan-kharchenko , made a final visit to belgrade and kosovo to brief rival serbs and kosovo albanians on their report following four months of talks . the final report is due to be handed to un secretary general ban ki-moon on december 10 . the leaders of kosovo 's albanian majority have said they will proclaim the region 's independence soon after this date .
serbia is only prepared to grant autonomy styled after the model of hong kong or finland 's aland islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger speaking to blic , ischinger said that a " possible scenario " would be that the leaders of kosovo albanians unilaterally declare independence . " my impression is that this step shall be coordinated with the eu , us and other countries .
one thing is clear : the status quo is unsustainable and a decision is necessary . " ischinger said that as regards the question of how the international community should act towards kosovo after december 10 would be answered differently in the capitals of the eu , russia and the us . only russia supported serbia 's view that kosovo should formally remain its province . washington was in favor of kosovo going independent under international supervision , a plan also endorsed by most eu nations , although the 27-nation bloc failed to reach a consensus . international community fears violence the international community is fearful that a declaration of independence could reignite tensions , resulting in violence .
last week , nato reinforced its 17,000-strong kfor peacekeeping mission in kosovo with us and german troops . however , ischinger told journalists that both serbian and kosovo albanian leaders have pledged to refrain from resorting to violence .
" that is very important for the road ahead , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uefa president michel platini has confirmed that european soccer 's governing body and police are investigating match-fixing in 15 top-level matches . " uefa introduced , over one year ago , an early warning system in order to monitor irregular betting activities , and agreed to work together with the appropriate police authorities , " europe 's international soccer association said in a statement . platini added that the organization was investigating 15 games in cooperation with europol and that the possibility of match-fixing by asian betting syndicates in top-flight european soccer had also come up in a november conference on violence in sports . five uefa officials visited the europol headquarters in the hague in early november to hand over a 96-page dossier outlining suspicions that games were being fixed , according to the magazine . strange betting patterns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa said the scandal did not include euro 2008 qualifiers " we need to find striking evidence before we can initiate disciplinary procedures , " said william gaillard , uefa 's director of communications .
" some of these strange patterns may be strange patterns and that 's it .
others may have something behind it . " the uefa report covered a total of 26 games , including three in the third preliminary round of the champions league , two in the uefa cup and one in the qualifiers for euro 2008 .
fifteen of the suspect games were played during the current season with the other 11 between july 2005 and november 2006 , der spiegel said . teams involved came mainly from the balkans , as well as eastern and southern europe and betting sums were reported to be in the millions , most of which reportedly flowed to asian betting syndicates . front for money laundering ? peter limacher , head of uefa 's disciplinary commission , said there is also a concern that the gambling is being used to launder money . " when large amounts of money are bet at odds of 1 euro to 1.05 euros " it 's not about profits but about getting " clean " money , he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . platini told welt am sonntag that the uefa has decided to organize a conference with the eu in 2008 about corruption and money-laundering in the sport . " i love soccer and we must protect it with everything in our power , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .

" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .

the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .

2 , where vladimir putin ’ s united russia party won a two-thirds majority .
but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

" after intensive efforts made during the past 120 days in finding common points , i think there are no additional options that would lead towards a kosovo status solution based on compromise , " eu mediator wolfgang ischinger told the belgrade daily , blic . ischinger also said that the troika 's report does not include any proposals defining the serbian province 's future status . serbian officials meanwhile continued to express optimism for continuation of the kosovo status talks . " we believe that the negotiation process does not end with the report of the troika , rather , that it is yet another phase , more successful than the last , " said serbian kosovo minister slobodan samardzic . independence a possible scenario ischinger , along with us envoy frank wisner and russian envoy alexander botsan-kharchenko , made a final visit to belgrade and kosovo to brief rival serbs and kosovo albanians on their report following four months of talks . the final report is due to be handed to un secretary general ban ki-moon on december 10 . the leaders of kosovo 's albanian majority have said they will proclaim the region 's independence soon after this date .
serbia is only prepared to grant autonomy styled after the model of hong kong or finland 's aland islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger speaking to blic , ischinger said that a " possible scenario " would be that the leaders of kosovo albanians unilaterally declare independence . " my impression is that this step shall be coordinated with the eu , us and other countries .
one thing is clear : the status quo is unsustainable and a decision is necessary . " ischinger said that as regards the question of how the international community should act towards kosovo after december 10 would be answered differently in the capitals of the eu , russia and the us . only russia supported serbia 's view that kosovo should formally remain its province . washington was in favor of kosovo going independent under international supervision , a plan also endorsed by most eu nations , although the 27-nation bloc failed to reach a consensus . international community fears violence the international community is fearful that a declaration of independence could reignite tensions , resulting in violence .
last week , nato reinforced its 17,000-strong kfor peacekeeping mission in kosovo with us and german troops . however , ischinger told journalists that both serbian and kosovo albanian leaders have pledged to refrain from resorting to violence .

the cdu 's annual party congress began monday , dec .
3 . the cdu has traditionally been seen as a conservative party that promotes traditional family values and strong business ties .
but the party decided to reaffirm its commitment to swing voters at its meeting in the northern german city of hanover this week .
under the slogan " party of the center " the cdu will try to distinguish itself from coalition partner and rival , the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
two years into her term as chancellor , merkel made it clear that her party needs to go beyond their traditional base if they want to be able to choose their own coalition partners in the next elections .
" we are in the center , and only us , " merkel told delegates at the party conference .
merkel critical of spd 's move left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to distance itself from its political rivals on the left merkel attacked the spd 's decision in october to reverse a key job market reform .
the spd shifted to the left at its party congress in hamburg in an attempt to win back support lost to the left party .
merkel , 53 , said the social democrats " renounced the center a few weeks ago . "
" with all the strength that comes from the centre we say : socialism has done enough damage in germany .
we do n't ever want socialism again , " merkel said .
yet the chancellor faces a balancing act .
while she needs to stake out a clear position for the cdu , she will also need to keep the " grand coalition " together until the 2009 elections .
cdu 's popularity on the upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed towards " the middle " merkel 's party has benefitted from her personal popularity and from germany 's economic boom .
a recent poll put the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at 40 percent .
in contrast , the spd has fallen to 26 percent as the junior partner in merkel 's " grand coalition . "
another survey published saturday showed 57 percent of people polled said they did not want the coalition to return to power after the elections scheduled for 2009 .
conservative values remain central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't see turkey entering the eu merkel has said she wants to create a " society of opportunity " and use a big-tent approach to the party 's vision .
analysts also expect the hanover congress to restate core cdu values and policies .
merkel said her party would do " everything to create jobs and nothing to destroy them . "
the cdu is also expected to voice its support for advocating more money for families who choose to keep their small children at home .
the cdu also rejected full european union membership for turkey .
merkel has repeatedly declared her preference that turkey be given a " privileged partnership " instead of eu membership .
" we are committed to a privileged partnership for turkey , but we are opposed to full membership for turkey in the european union , " merkel said at the party conference monday .
the cdu will also focus on integrating immigrants into " predominent german culture " instead of embracing multiculturalism .
while the government agreed on a deal to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , merkel said other deals would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
she said she was opposed to the introduction of an " across-the-board " minimum wage . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .

after two terms in office , putin is not eligible to run as president in the elections next year .
but experts said his clear majority in parliament could lead to a change in the law to give additional powers to another position , which putin would then occupy .
in the run up to the elections , putin himself said that a clear election victory would give him a " moral " mandate to continue a leadership role in the future government . the results have been tallied and the russian people have provided the wished-for conclusion .
in putin 's russia , politics has become a pompous staging ground marked by kremlin intrigue and opaque maneuverings .
as much as possible , it 's important to try and look behind the scenes .
yet when the curtain gets pulled back , it becomes clear that political pluralism is only a front in russia .

germany is often referred to as a global leader on climate protection , but on the opening of a major un conference on climate change , german environmentalists say it 's a reputation that is n't always deserved . in germany , green is good .
the renewable energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds , and the country 's pioneering laws to promote renewables serve as a role model for other nations . germans themselves are conscientious recyclers who separate their trash and take their own carrier bags to the supermarket while chancellor angela merkel has made climate a key issue of her administration and of germany 's g8 presidency , leading to her being dubbed the " klimakanzlerin , " or climate chancellor . but when it comes to pursuing climate protection goals , the country has run out of steam , say environmental activists . as the united nations ' climate change conference opened in bali on monday , dozens of activist groups banded together to call on the german government to do justice to its reputation as a global leader on climate protection . in particular , environmentalists take issue with the government 's plans to build as many as 25 coal-fired power stations , and the german car industry 's opposition to speed limits which would cut carbon dioxide emissions . coal to fill void left by nuclear phase-out greenpeace germany , for example , has criticized merkel for making big pledges to cut the country 's co2 levels at international events , and then quietly approving plans to expand the coal industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says climate issues are a top priority in june , the european union agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel , the driving force behind the target , pledged to make more radical cuts of up to 40 percent should other industrialized countries make similar commitments . but in germany , coal-fired power stations currently account for 44 percent of germany 's energy supply - a share that is only set to increase with the addition of more such power stations which the government says are needed to fill the void left by the phase-out of atomic energy . " there is a clear contradiction between merkel 's public stance at international forums and the german reality , " said greenpeace germany spokesman karsten smid .
" the goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent can not be achieved in any case , and the figures do not even take into account the 25 new power stations being planned , " he told the german news agency dpa . merkel was opposed to the nuclear phase-out which was agreed under the previous government .
" it does n't make sense to say you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then have the first thing you do be to switch off that -lrb- energy source -rrb- which does n't create any co2 emissions , " she said at the party conference of her christian democratic union in hanover on monday .
but , referring to efforts to halt construction of the country 's new coal-burning plants , she said that this , too " defies common sense " if germany 's future energy supply is to be secure . clean energy from renewables currently makes up 12 percent of germany 's energy supply , and while she stresses her commitment to the expansion of this sector , merkel has repeatedly said that coal will remain an irreplaceable part of germany 's " energy mix . " activists campaigning for speed limits just as driving fast , gas-guzzling cars on a highway with no speed limits looks set to remain an irreplaceable part of german culture , much to the dismay of environmental groups who say this passion for polluting cars is part of the dirty flipside of the country 's clean , green image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's highway system is still without speed limits they note that the government refuses to consider introducing speed limits on the 6,000 km -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- of highway where there is no top limit .
environmentalists argue that speed limits could cut germany 's co2 emissions instantly , and also do away with german carmakers need to produce the heavy , powerful cars that are designed to do the speed on the autobahn . but according to a new survey by german legal insurer arag , that would be one more factor to add to the growing weariness among the german population for the issue of climate protection .
of the over 1000 germans polled for the company 's latest " deutschland trend " survey , two-thirds rejected the idea of introducing national climate protection measures . among the respondents classified as executives and civil servants , only 53.4 percent said they were in favor of something concrete being done in 2008 in germany to protect the climate .
and more than 76 percent of the respondents meant to represent germany 's middle class said they saw no reason to drive their cars less , or improve energy efficiency in their own homes . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .
seven other parties failed to reach the 7-percent minimum , which was raised from 5 percent prior to the elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called on the russian public to cast their ballots for united russia shortly after the vote , the united states government called for a probe to investigate claims of vote-rigging , while nikolai konkin , deputy chairman of the elections committee , promised that " all complaints and allegations will be carefully examined . " the head of russia 's election commission , however , said on monday that there were no major violations at the country 's parliamentary polls , interfax reported . opposition criticizes abuse but accusations were rife among all 11 parties participating in the vote .
they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station .

" they 're raping the democratic system . " in the days and weeks ahead of the dec .
2 vote , the kremlin clamped down on opposition organizations , breaking up rallies and raiding party headquarters .
kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair . " the state duma election in the russian federation on the 2nd december 2007 was not fair and failed to meet many osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , " the joint observer mission said in a statement . allegations were made that voters were bribed with televisions and refrigerators to vote for the incumbent party and a report came from st. petersburg that groups of people were bussed from one polling station to another to cast multiple votes . " these are not isolated incidents , " said grigory melkonyans , also of golos .
" the complaints are from every corner of russia . " turnout was high among the country 's 109 million registered voters , with more than 60 percent casting their ballots .
the dec .
2 vote was the fifth parliamentary election since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
it is the first since introducing new rules raising the representational threshold for entering the duma from five to seven percent . t est-run for march presidential election ? the leader of president vladimir putin 's united russia party said a strong showing in sunday 's parliamentary election was a personal victory for putin .
the president has enjoyed widespread popularity due to huge revenues from energy exports , steadily rising living standards and a restored sense of national pride following the post-soviet trauma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin supporters took to the streets ahead of the election " this election was a referendum on president putin so i think we can say he has won a victory , " united russia chief boris gryzlov told reporters .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .
lugovei , who is wanted by the british government in connection with the radiation poisoning of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko , would receive legal immunity as a member of parliament . relations with west turn tense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel said she hoped russia would move toward allowing free parties on the eve of the elections , there was also concern in the west , where relations with russia have become increasingly tense under putin , who controls the world 's largest energy reserves . last week , the russian president had accused the west of " poking their snotty noses " in his country ’ s affairs . the main european election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , called off its observer mission in russia , complaining of a lack of cooperation from moscow .
as a result , fewer than 80 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones . in a radio interview on sunday , german chancellor angela merkel criticized the lack of foreign observers permitted to monitor the elections . " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .
she said she hoped russia would move towards allowing more different opinions . dw staff -lrb- ktz / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the vote means that vladimir putin is our national leader .
his politics will be carried forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabitz cornelia putin ran as the top candidate for united russia , and the kremlin characterized the election as a presidential referendum .
after two terms in office , putin is not eligible to run as president in the elections next year .
but experts said his clear majority in parliament could lead to a change in the law to give additional powers to another position , which putin would then occupy .
in the run up to the elections , putin himself said that a clear election victory would give him a " moral " mandate to continue a leadership role in the future government . the results have been tallied and the russian people have provided the wished-for conclusion .
in putin 's russia , politics has become a pompous staging ground marked by kremlin intrigue and opaque maneuverings .
as much as possible , it 's important to try and look behind the scenes .
yet when the curtain gets pulled back , it becomes clear that political pluralism is only a front in russia .
the so-called " kremlin parties " have a two-thirds majority in russia .
the communists provide the only real opposition , which is a ludicrous idea . democracy is the undisputed loser of this stage-managed election .
in particular , the democratic institutions , above all the parliament , have been converted into a docile instrument in the hands of those in power in the kremlin . the other losers in this election are the russian opposition , which found itself marginalized and divided in an attempt to win against this new social trend .
opposition leaders should not count on help from outside russia . russian voters showed that they want stability and prosperity and fear chaos .
their motives and fears should be taken seriously .
voters knowingly strengthened putin , a person who considers democracy a facade . but the election left an important question unanswered : what will become of vladimir putin ?
vladimir putin proved that electoral manipulations and the injustice as well as lies and personality cult would not change the election outcome . does putin have a master plan for retaining power ?
if left out of the presidential race , what position will he use to influence russia 's future ?
there are no answers , nor even hints .
russia is ruled with smokescreens and camouflage and is dominated by and increasingly authoritarian ghost .
the voters only applaud his power . germany , europe and the world are unfortunately observers of this power play .
they can criticize , but they know that their threats are meaningless .
it 's clear that russia 's political involvement is very important in several areas .
it would be counterproductive for europe to cut off contact , close down business ties and freeze engagement . change and democratic improvement in russia will only come from inside the country .
the parliamentary election has shown that this road remains a very long one . cornelia rabitz is the director of dw-radio 's russia program -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .
but some europeans suspect that washington is not overly concerned with the weakness of its currency , as it has helped us exporters . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .
seven other parties failed to reach the 7-percent minimum , which was raised from 5 percent prior to the elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called on the russian public to cast their ballots for united russia shortly after the vote , the united states government called for a probe to investigate claims of vote-rigging , while nikolai konkin , deputy chairman of the elections committee , promised that " all complaints and allegations will be carefully examined . " the head of russia 's election commission , however , said on monday that there were no major violations at the country 's parliamentary polls , interfax reported . opposition criticizes abuse but accusations were rife among all 11 parties participating in the vote .
they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .
communist legal chief vadim solovyev told ria novosti news agency that there were " violations exceeding all acceptable norms . "
the party said it would meet on monday to discuss whether to boycott the new parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasparov said democracy in russia has died former chess grandmaster and kremlin critic garry kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station .

kasparov recently spent five days behind bars for participating in an unauthorized protest . the opposition , ranging from liberals to the communists , charges the kremlin with suppressing debate , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . communist party leader gennady zyuganov said the election had been the " least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia and there had been " numerous violations , " itar-tass news agency reported . observers suspect vote-rigging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say voters were bribed to increase turnout " we have seen a campaign of unprecedented pressure on the voters , " said alexander kynev at golos , an independent voter watchdog body which receives eu and us government funds . international observers from the osce and the council of europe said monday that the election was unfair .

kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov added that russian voters had spoken in favor of president putin ’ s course " being continued after the current president ’ s term ends . " putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .

" the vote means that vladimir putin is our national leader .
his politics will be carried forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabitz cornelia putin ran as the top candidate for united russia , and the kremlin characterized the election as a presidential referendum .
after two terms in office , putin is not eligible to run as president in the elections next year .
but experts said his clear majority in parliament could lead to a change in the law to give additional powers to another position , which putin would then occupy .
in the run up to the elections , putin himself said that a clear election victory would give him a " moral " mandate to continue a leadership role in the future government . the results have been tallied and the russian people have provided the wished-for conclusion .
in putin 's russia , politics has become a pompous staging ground marked by kremlin intrigue and opaque maneuverings .
as much as possible , it 's important to try and look behind the scenes .
yet when the curtain gets pulled back , it becomes clear that political pluralism is only a front in russia .
the so-called " kremlin parties " have a two-thirds majority in russia .
the communists provide the only real opposition , which is a ludicrous idea . democracy is the undisputed loser of this stage-managed election .
in particular , the democratic institutions , above all the parliament , have been converted into a docile instrument in the hands of those in power in the kremlin . the other losers in this election are the russian opposition , which found itself marginalized and divided in an attempt to win against this new social trend .
opposition leaders should not count on help from outside russia . russian voters showed that they want stability and prosperity and fear chaos .
their motives and fears should be taken seriously .
voters knowingly strengthened putin , a person who considers democracy a facade . but the election left an important question unanswered : what will become of vladimir putin ?
vladimir putin proved that electoral manipulations and the injustice as well as lies and personality cult would not change the election outcome . does putin have a master plan for retaining power ?
if left out of the presidential race , what position will he use to influence russia 's future ?
there are no answers , nor even hints .
russia is ruled with smokescreens and camouflage and is dominated by and increasingly authoritarian ghost .
the voters only applaud his power . germany , europe and the world are unfortunately observers of this power play .
they can criticize , but they know that their threats are meaningless .
it 's clear that russia 's political involvement is very important in several areas .
it would be counterproductive for europe to cut off contact , close down business ties and freeze engagement . change and democratic improvement in russia will only come from inside the country .
the parliamentary election has shown that this road remains a very long one . cornelia rabitz is the director of dw-radio 's russia program -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uefa president michel platini has confirmed that european soccer 's governing body and police are investigating match-fixing in 15 top-level matches . " uefa introduced , over one year ago , an early warning system in order to monitor irregular betting activities , and agreed to work together with the appropriate police authorities , " europe 's international soccer association said in a statement . platini added that the organization was investigating 15 games in cooperation with europol and that the possibility of match-fixing by asian betting syndicates in top-flight european soccer had also come up in a november conference on violence in sports . five uefa officials visited the europol headquarters in the hague in early november to hand over a 96-page dossier outlining suspicions that games were being fixed , according to the magazine . strange betting patterns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa said the scandal did not include euro 2008 qualifiers " we need to find striking evidence before we can initiate disciplinary procedures , " said william gaillard , uefa 's director of communications .
" some of these strange patterns may be strange patterns and that 's it .
others may have something behind it . " the uefa report covered a total of 26 games , including three in the third preliminary round of the champions league , two in the uefa cup and one in the qualifiers for euro 2008 .
fifteen of the suspect games were played during the current season with the other 11 between july 2005 and november 2006 , der spiegel said . teams involved came mainly from the balkans , as well as eastern and southern europe and betting sums were reported to be in the millions , most of which reportedly flowed to asian betting syndicates . front for money laundering ? peter limacher , head of uefa 's disciplinary commission , said there is also a concern that the gambling is being used to launder money . " when large amounts of money are bet at odds of 1 euro to 1.05 euros " it 's not about profits but about getting " clean " money , he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . platini told welt am sonntag that the uefa has decided to organize a conference with the eu in 2008 about corruption and money-laundering in the sport .

after two terms in office , putin is not eligible to run as president in the elections next year .
but experts said his clear majority in parliament could lead to a change in the law to give additional powers to another position , which putin would then occupy .
in the run up to the elections , putin himself said that a clear election victory would give him a " moral " mandate to continue a leadership role in the future government . the results have been tallied and the russian people have provided the wished-for conclusion .
in putin 's russia , politics has become a pompous staging ground marked by kremlin intrigue and opaque maneuverings .
as much as possible , it 's important to try and look behind the scenes .
yet when the curtain gets pulled back , it becomes clear that political pluralism is only a front in russia .
the so-called " kremlin parties " have a two-thirds majority in russia .
the communists provide the only real opposition , which is a ludicrous idea . democracy is the undisputed loser of this stage-managed election .
in particular , the democratic institutions , above all the parliament , have been converted into a docile instrument in the hands of those in power in the kremlin . the other losers in this election are the russian opposition , which found itself marginalized and divided in an attempt to win against this new social trend .
opposition leaders should not count on help from outside russia . russian voters showed that they want stability and prosperity and fear chaos .
their motives and fears should be taken seriously .
voters knowingly strengthened putin , a person who considers democracy a facade . but the election left an important question unanswered : what will become of vladimir putin ?
vladimir putin proved that electoral manipulations and the injustice as well as lies and personality cult would not change the election outcome . does putin have a master plan for retaining power ?
if left out of the presidential race , what position will he use to influence russia 's future ?
there are no answers , nor even hints .
russia is ruled with smokescreens and camouflage and is dominated by and increasingly authoritarian ghost .
the voters only applaud his power . germany , europe and the world are unfortunately observers of this power play .
they can criticize , but they know that their threats are meaningless .
it 's clear that russia 's political involvement is very important in several areas .
it would be counterproductive for europe to cut off contact , close down business ties and freeze engagement . change and democratic improvement in russia will only come from inside the country .
the parliamentary election has shown that this road remains a very long one . cornelia rabitz is the director of dw-radio 's russia program -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party and pro-kremlin party a just russia barely passed the new 7-percent threshold needed to enter the lower house of parliament , the duma .

they claim that putin 's party enjoyed an unfair advantage under new election laws and blanket media coverage resulting from putin 's abuse of the presidents ' office for campaign purposes . former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , who plans to run in the next presidential election in march 2008 , called the elections " dishonest and unfair . "
the liberal union of right forces said they would respond to the election result with a campaign of " civil disobedience . " in addition , the opposition communist party said it would challenge the results at the supreme court .

" putin , 55 , said before the election that a big victory would give him a " moral " mandate to retain a major role when he steps down next year after two consecutive kremlin terms , the maximum allowed by the constitution . speculation is focusing on whether the ex-kgb agent will seek to keep power through a new post or behind the scenes while a loyalist takes over the presidency in elections next march .
some suspect he may circumvent the constitutional two-term limit by handing over power temporarily to a trusted ally before returning to the presidency . gryzlov told reporters on sunday that united russia would nominate its candidate for the march presidential elections at its congress later this month , but declined to say who it would be . the success of the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party in meeting the seven-percent minimum for parliamentary representation has made it possible for andrei lugovei to become a deputy .

the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar . producing planes in the euro zone and selling them in dollars has become an expensive proposition for airbus .
as part of a cost-cutting plan , eads , the parent company to airbus , has already announced it will shift some production to china .
now , it looks like some production will also shift to the us to take advantage of the weak dollar . " we do n't have a choice , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads , told europe 1 radio monday . gallois said the only way to " prepare the company for a dollar that no one can control is - unfortunately - to set up shop in a dollar zone . " gallois has warned several times recently that the euro 's strength against the dollar threatens the company 's long-term survival .
the dollar has lost 30 percent against the euro in the past two years , a fall that has caused airbus earnings to nosedive . europe will see cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic considerations might switch some airbus production to the us gallois said only some of the production would transfer out of europe , such as aircraft doors , fuselage and wing components .
the shift will happen gradually and will be seen " over the next decade " gallois said .
currently , most airbus production is done in germany and france . airbus has launched a cost-cutting plan dubbed power8 .
the plan will cut 10,000 jobs in an attempt to save 5 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 .
the restructuring plan will likely include the sale of six european factories .
the move was prompted due to problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo jet program . the company is also building an assembly plant near beijing , which is scheduled to be completed in 2011 . aircraft makers fleeing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois said some production will likely move stateside airbus is not alone in deciding to move production out of the euro zone .
france 's dassault aviation will also shift some of its production away from europe , the company 's chairman said in an interview published saturday in the paris newspaper le monde . charles edelstenne said that apart from the assembly of the dasault aircraft and technology work , " everything can be relocated . "
most of the company 's competitors are in the us and that the slide of the dollar makes it increasingly difficult to compete . " we must reduce our costs further to remain competitive , " edelstenne said . doing business in dollars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of airbus ' income is in dollars , while its expenses are in euros airbus customers are also largely in the us and insist on planes being priced in dollars .
this is difficult since the company 's costs , including the wages it pays employees , remain in euros . the german business weekly wirtschaftswoche recently reported that the company was likely to set up an assembly plant in mobile , alabama .
the company believes that it could secure a contract to build tanker aircraft for the us military , according to the news report . gallois said the euro-dollar discrepancy is causing europe to lose its industrial might and said " a political " approach is needed to fix the exchange rate problem . " a part of the european aeronautic and space industry is threatened by the evolution of the dollar and i think it is a problem that has a political dimension , " he said , adding : " europe needs to wake up . " calls for a political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has always been a european product gallois called for a meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations , which includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states . " there is a deep crisis afflicting a certain number of industries that is due solely to the fact that the americans are following a policy that will mean a never-ending decline in the dollar , " he said . us officials have said they want to maintain a strong dollar .

2 , where vladimir putin ’ s united russia party won a two-thirds majority .
but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

uefa president michel platini has confirmed that european soccer 's governing body and police are investigating match-fixing in 15 top-level matches . " uefa introduced , over one year ago , an early warning system in order to monitor irregular betting activities , and agreed to work together with the appropriate police authorities , " europe 's international soccer association said in a statement . platini added that the organization was investigating 15 games in cooperation with europol and that the possibility of match-fixing by asian betting syndicates in top-flight european soccer had also come up in a november conference on violence in sports . five uefa officials visited the europol headquarters in the hague in early november to hand over a 96-page dossier outlining suspicions that games were being fixed , according to the magazine . strange betting patterns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa said the scandal did not include euro 2008 qualifiers " we need to find striking evidence before we can initiate disciplinary procedures , " said william gaillard , uefa 's director of communications .
" some of these strange patterns may be strange patterns and that 's it .
others may have something behind it . " the uefa report covered a total of 26 games , including three in the third preliminary round of the champions league , two in the uefa cup and one in the qualifiers for euro 2008 .
fifteen of the suspect games were played during the current season with the other 11 between july 2005 and november 2006 , der spiegel said . teams involved came mainly from the balkans , as well as eastern and southern europe and betting sums were reported to be in the millions , most of which reportedly flowed to asian betting syndicates . front for money laundering ? peter limacher , head of uefa 's disciplinary commission , said there is also a concern that the gambling is being used to launder money . " when large amounts of money are bet at odds of 1 euro to 1.05 euros " it 's not about profits but about getting " clean " money , he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . platini told welt am sonntag that the uefa has decided to organize a conference with the eu in 2008 about corruption and money-laundering in the sport . " i love soccer and we must protect it with everything in our power , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , where vladimir putin ’ s united russia party won a two-thirds majority .
but some say russia is ready for discourse with the west . “ this election was conducted russian style , ” said kimmo kiljunen , president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said of the parliamentary vote on sunday in russia .
“ i mean , there was the strange situation that the executive nearly elected the legislature .
it should actually be the other way around . ” the osce had been planning to monitor the election but called off its participation , claiming difficulties in obtaining visas .
russian president vladimir putin blamed the organization ’ s withdrawal on american intervention , which he said was meant to discredit the election process . the german government joined in the critic , saying clearly that “ there was no free , equal , democratic election . “ russia wasn ’ t a democracy and russia isn ’ t a democracy , ” government spokesman thomas steg said unambiguously on monday , reiterating chancellor angela merkel ’ s comment on sunday that germany ’ s path of political development could not be repeated in russia . appeal to uphold rule of law in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections served to boost putin 's power , said critics in addition to claims of vote-rigging , speculations have arisen that , with his party ’ s two-thirds after sunday ’ s election , putin would either try to maneuver his way back into the presidency following his second term or maintain political influence from outside the presidency .
the russian constitution limits heads of state to two consecutive terms . “ the elections were deliberately used to enable putin to position himself , ” elmar brock , a member of germany ’ s christian democratic union and a foreign policy expert in the european parliament , told deutsche welle . the situation should be kept under observation , added brock . according to a spokeswoman from the german ministry of foreign affairs on monday , the german government called on russia ’ s political leaders not to change the constitution in a way that would lead the country away from rule of law or a multi-party system . discourse in russia is opening , say experts however , the western leaders watching the events in russia didn ’ t only point out negative trends . andreas schockenhoff , coordinator for german-russian cooperation in the german ministry of foreign affairs , said in an interview with deutsche welle that duma politicians as well as members of non-governmental organizations in russia have become more willing to speak openly and engage in private discussion . “ that ’ s something that didn ’ t happen before , ” said schockenhoff .
“ i believe that it ’ s our job now to get involved in discussion in russia and to have an influence so that russia opens up and develops toward democracy .
but we need patience and a long wind . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petersburg dialogue , founded in 2001 , is a venue of communication between german and russian civil societies brock agreed that there are “ new signs that moscow is willing to talk . ”
he added that russia and europe had “ many common interests “ and said he hoped that “ russia adopts a policy that takes these common interests into account . ” like schockenhoff , the president of the european parliament , hans-gerd pöttering , also said that europe needed to act .
he recommended a “ double strategy : talking and negotiating on the one hand but taking a critical view and giving our opinion on the other , ” he said on the northern german broadcaster ndr . russia has assets to protect according to norbert walter , chief political economist at deutsche bank , who also spoke with deutsche welle , russia will not only hurt its western partners but also itself if it doesn ’ t focus on democratic development . “ if russia doesn ’ t make decisive progress , its current riches , which are a result of its oil and gas , will just go to the dogs , ” said walter . the strength that russia has developed over the past five years “ through this political stabilization will become even stronger , ” he added .

both regulator ofcom and bt have expressed doubts about whether the time is ripe for rolling out what would be expensive fibre optic networks .
" we need significant evidence that such a network is required and i do n't think it exists yet , " said peter philips , ofcom 's head of strategy .
network firms have also questioned if a faster net would make economic sense .
" the question is how to make money and i 'm not sure the answer is good , " said justin paul , a development manager at telecoms equipment firm alcatel-lucent .
broadband speeds around the world there is also uncertainty over whether people would be willing to pay more for faster broadband .
super-fast broadband capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- has worked its way up the political agenda in recent months .
competitiveness minister stephen timms recently hosted a summit on the issue , while mps recently held an eforum to debate the need for next-generation networks and regulator ofcom has launched its own consultation .
fibre networks capable of speeds of up to 100mbps are already commonplace in japan and south korea and are starting to be rolled out in countries such as the us , france and germany .
we are not facing large numbers of people today who are constrained by their bandwidth , peter mccarthy-ward , bt the broadband stakeholder group -lrb- bsg -rrb- kick-started the debate in the spring of this year with a major report looking at how and why britain would need next-generation broadband network .
bsg chief executive antony walker said it was not yet time to panic .
" there is lots of competition and innovation in the broadband market and -lsb- it is not clear that -rsb- current bandwidth is a problem .
we do n't need to make any rash moves but the time is ripe for some collective thinking , " he said .
you can shoot someone so much quicker at 50 megabits howard watson , virgin regulator ofcom is also heavily involved in the debate and is aware that for any company to commit to a multi-billion pound investment in a new network it would require some assurances from the government that it would be able to recoup its money .
while acknowledging that a fibre network " could be one of the most fundamental changes to our communications infrastructure in decades , " peter philips , head of strategy and market development at ofcom , is not entirely convinced that it is ready to come out of the starting blocks just yet .
" we need significant evidence that such a network is required and i do n't think it exists yet , " he said .
" we have to ask ourselves what would be the disadvantage if your investment comes later than others .
we would be able to learn from the experiences in other countries , " he added .
commercial incentive most industry watchers are aware that the obvious candidate for any network upgrade is the custodian of the current adsl broadband network , bt .
what will deliver next-generation broadband ?
bt is planning to up the speeds of adsl , with a new technology offering speeds of up to 24mbps and the roll-out of so-called adsl2 + will begin early next year and by 2011 all of bt telephone exchanges will have been upgraded .
it is also considering the business case of rolling out vdsl - a technology that offer fibre as far as the street cabinets .
this would offer speeds of up to 50mbps .
as far as fibre to the home goes - the real gold standard in the network world - bt has only committed to offering this technology -lrb- which offers speeds of up to 100mbps -rrb- on new housing estates , such as ebsfleet in kent which will eventually serve thousands of homes .
" no-one would be more delighted if a commercial incentive emerged that enabled us to fibre the nation , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
but he is not yet sure the demand is there .
" we are not facing large numbers of people today who are constrained by their bandwidth , " he said .
will gaming be one of key drivers for increased bandwidth ?
any commitment to a fibre network would need to be backed by reassurances from ofcom that it would be able to recoup its investment , he said .
it may sometimes seem like britain 's best kept secret , but there is already a next-generation network serving just over half the population .
virgin has pledged to upgrade its cable network - which reaches 52 % of the population - to 50mbps speeds by the end of 2008 .
speaking at a recent broadband conference , virgin media 's chief technology officer howard watson admitted that an upgrade of cable would not " be on the same scale as what bt would have to do , but neither is it a trivial amount of money " , but , he said , the investment was crucial to virgin 's strategy going forward .
" we are shifting our position to one driven by broadband and increasing speed , " he said .
triallists at the pilot sites in ashford , dover and folkestone are very happy with the service especially the ability it gives them to do fast downloads and access high-definition tv content , said mr watson .
" and gamers love it .
you can shoot someone so much quicker at 50 megabits , " he said .

" we have to ask ourselves what would be the disadvantage if your investment comes later than others .
we would be able to learn from the experiences in other countries , " he added .
commercial incentive most industry watchers are aware that the obvious candidate for any network upgrade is the custodian of the current adsl broadband network , bt .
what will deliver next-generation broadband ?
bt is planning to up the speeds of adsl , with a new technology offering speeds of up to 24mbps and the roll-out of so-called adsl2 + will begin early next year and by 2011 all of bt telephone exchanges will have been upgraded .
it is also considering the business case of rolling out vdsl - a technology that offer fibre as far as the street cabinets .
this would offer speeds of up to 50mbps .
as far as fibre to the home goes - the real gold standard in the network world - bt has only committed to offering this technology -lrb- which offers speeds of up to 100mbps -rrb- on new housing estates , such as ebsfleet in kent which will eventually serve thousands of homes .
" no-one would be more delighted if a commercial incentive emerged that enabled us to fibre the nation , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
but he is not yet sure the demand is there .
" we are not facing large numbers of people today who are constrained by their bandwidth , " he said .
will gaming be one of key drivers for increased bandwidth ?
any commitment to a fibre network would need to be backed by reassurances from ofcom that it would be able to recoup its investment , he said .
it may sometimes seem like britain 's best kept secret , but there is already a next-generation network serving just over half the population .
virgin has pledged to upgrade its cable network - which reaches 52 % of the population - to 50mbps speeds by the end of 2008 .
speaking at a recent broadband conference , virgin media 's chief technology officer howard watson admitted that an upgrade of cable would not " be on the same scale as what bt would have to do , but neither is it a trivial amount of money " , but , he said , the investment was crucial to virgin 's strategy going forward .
" we are shifting our position to one driven by broadband and increasing speed , " he said .
triallists at the pilot sites in ashford , dover and folkestone are very happy with the service especially the ability it gives them to do fast downloads and access high-definition tv content , said mr watson .
" and gamers love it .
you can shoot someone so much quicker at 50 megabits , " he said .

both regulator ofcom and bt have expressed doubts about whether the time is ripe for rolling out what would be expensive fibre optic networks .
" we need significant evidence that such a network is required and i do n't think it exists yet , " said peter philips , ofcom 's head of strategy .
network firms have also questioned if a faster net would make economic sense .
" the question is how to make money and i 'm not sure the answer is good , " said justin paul , a development manager at telecoms equipment firm alcatel-lucent .
broadband speeds around the world there is also uncertainty over whether people would be willing to pay more for faster broadband .
super-fast broadband capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- has worked its way up the political agenda in recent months .
competitiveness minister stephen timms recently hosted a summit on the issue , while mps recently held an eforum to debate the need for next-generation networks and regulator ofcom has launched its own consultation .
fibre networks capable of speeds of up to 100mbps are already commonplace in japan and south korea and are starting to be rolled out in countries such as the us , france and germany .
we are not facing large numbers of people today who are constrained by their bandwidth , peter mccarthy-ward , bt the broadband stakeholder group -lrb- bsg -rrb- kick-started the debate in the spring of this year with a major report looking at how and why britain would need next-generation broadband network .
bsg chief executive antony walker said it was not yet time to panic .
" there is lots of competition and innovation in the broadband market and -lsb- it is not clear that -rsb- current bandwidth is a problem .
we do n't need to make any rash moves but the time is ripe for some collective thinking , " he said .
you can shoot someone so much quicker at 50 megabits howard watson , virgin regulator ofcom is also heavily involved in the debate and is aware that for any company to commit to a multi-billion pound investment in a new network it would require some assurances from the government that it would be able to recoup its money .
while acknowledging that a fibre network " could be one of the most fundamental changes to our communications infrastructure in decades , " peter philips , head of strategy and market development at ofcom , is not entirely convinced that it is ready to come out of the starting blocks just yet .
" we need significant evidence that such a network is required and i do n't think it exists yet , " he said .
" we have to ask ourselves what would be the disadvantage if your investment comes later than others .
we would be able to learn from the experiences in other countries , " he added .
commercial incentive most industry watchers are aware that the obvious candidate for any network upgrade is the custodian of the current adsl broadband network , bt .
what will deliver next-generation broadband ?
bt is planning to up the speeds of adsl , with a new technology offering speeds of up to 24mbps and the roll-out of so-called adsl2 + will begin early next year and by 2011 all of bt telephone exchanges will have been upgraded .
it is also considering the business case of rolling out vdsl - a technology that offer fibre as far as the street cabinets .
this would offer speeds of up to 50mbps .
as far as fibre to the home goes - the real gold standard in the network world - bt has only committed to offering this technology -lrb- which offers speeds of up to 100mbps -rrb- on new housing estates , such as ebsfleet in kent which will eventually serve thousands of homes .
" no-one would be more delighted if a commercial incentive emerged that enabled us to fibre the nation , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
but he is not yet sure the demand is there .
" we are not facing large numbers of people today who are constrained by their bandwidth , " he said .
will gaming be one of key drivers for increased bandwidth ?
any commitment to a fibre network would need to be backed by reassurances from ofcom that it would be able to recoup its investment , he said .
it may sometimes seem like britain 's best kept secret , but there is already a next-generation network serving just over half the population .
virgin has pledged to upgrade its cable network - which reaches 52 % of the population - to 50mbps speeds by the end of 2008 .
speaking at a recent broadband conference , virgin media 's chief technology officer howard watson admitted that an upgrade of cable would not " be on the same scale as what bt would have to do , but neither is it a trivial amount of money " , but , he said , the investment was crucial to virgin 's strategy going forward .
" we are shifting our position to one driven by broadband and increasing speed , " he said .
triallists at the pilot sites in ashford , dover and folkestone are very happy with the service especially the ability it gives them to do fast downloads and access high-definition tv content , said mr watson .
" and gamers love it .
you can shoot someone so much quicker at 50 megabits , " he said .

while acknowledging that a fibre network " could be one of the most fundamental changes to our communications infrastructure in decades , " peter philips , head of strategy and market development at ofcom , is not entirely convinced that it is ready to come out of the starting blocks just yet .
" we need significant evidence that such a network is required and i do n't think it exists yet , " he said .
" we have to ask ourselves what would be the disadvantage if your investment comes later than others .
we would be able to learn from the experiences in other countries , " he added .
commercial incentive most industry watchers are aware that the obvious candidate for any network upgrade is the custodian of the current adsl broadband network , bt .
what will deliver next-generation broadband ?
bt is planning to up the speeds of adsl , with a new technology offering speeds of up to 24mbps and the roll-out of so-called adsl2 + will begin early next year and by 2011 all of bt telephone exchanges will have been upgraded .
it is also considering the business case of rolling out vdsl - a technology that offer fibre as far as the street cabinets .
this would offer speeds of up to 50mbps .
as far as fibre to the home goes - the real gold standard in the network world - bt has only committed to offering this technology -lrb- which offers speeds of up to 100mbps -rrb- on new housing estates , such as ebsfleet in kent which will eventually serve thousands of homes .
" no-one would be more delighted if a commercial incentive emerged that enabled us to fibre the nation , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
but he is not yet sure the demand is there .
" we are not facing large numbers of people today who are constrained by their bandwidth , " he said .
any commitment to a fibre network would need to be backed by reassurances from ofcom that it would be able to recoup its investment , he said .
it may sometimes seem like britain 's best kept secret , but there is already a next-generation network serving just over half the population .
virgin has pledged to upgrade its cable network - which reaches 52 % of the population - to 50mbps speeds by the end of 2008 .
speaking at a recent broadband conference , virgin media 's chief technology officer howard watson admitted that an upgrade of cable would not " be on the same scale as what bt would have to do , but neither is it a trivial amount of money " , but , he said , the investment was crucial to virgin 's strategy going forward .
" we are shifting our position to one driven by broadband and increasing speed , " he said .
triallists at the pilot sites in ashford , dover and folkestone are very happy with the service especially the ability it gives them to do fast downloads and access high-definition tv content , said mr watson .
" and gamers love it .
you can shoot someone so much quicker at 50 megabits , " he said .

what would barnard say about transplantation today ?
admittedly , his patient lasted little longer than two weeks , but a huge medical advance had been made .
yet 40 years on , are we still advancing ?
well , here in the uk , not exactly .
heart transplantation in this country was at its peak about a decade ago .
then , over 350 such operations were carried out each year .
last year , less than half that number were performed .
dying differently it is not all bad news .
new techniques mean people with imperfect hearts can go longer without , potentially , ever needing a transplant .
waiting list 2006-2007 307 people on it at some point 28 died waiting for a heart 32 removed from list as too ill but without a doubt the figures also reflect a fall in the number of viable organ donors , even though the number of people registering themselves as organ donors continues to climb .
one of the problems - from the heart patient 's perspective - is that we are simply are not dying like we used to .
road accidents used to provide a rich seam of organs .
victims are usually healthy , often young , and the injuries sustained tend to be the head , not to other parts of the body .
but safety campaigns have had an impact , and the number of traffic deaths has fallen dramatically , seriously impinging on the number of organs available .
survival rates one year : 80 % five years : 70 % ten years : 53 % while the typical donor used to be a 20-year-old man who had fallen off his motorbike , now he is much more likely to be a 55-year-old who smoked .
less than perfect organs can be " repaired " , but the situation is not ideal .
papworth hospital , where the first ever nhs transplant was carried out in 1979 , was recently given the all-clear following an inquiry into why seven out of 20 patients treated this year who died within 30 days of surgery .
many random factors may have been involved , but the deaths did raise questions about the quality of organs currently being donated .
ill and waiting the commission which investigated the deaths also stressed that those being operated on were " extremely ill " to begin with .
i used to be operating on people who might still have years to live , but shortages now mean that only people in an absolutely critical condition are offered organs professor john dark but this in itself is a shift from the past .
" i used to be operating on people who might still have years to live , but shortages now mean that only people in an absolutely critical condition are offered organs , " says professor john dark , a heart surgeon who works at the freeman hospital in newcastle .
" the waiting list has fallen , but out of practical necessity .
people who would once have gone on the list just do n't get put on it anymore .
we deal only with the very , very sick . "
last year there were 307 people who at some point were on the waiting list .
of these , 28 died while waiting for a heart , and a further 32 were removed from the list because they were too ill to undergo treatment .
" you can add these last numbers to the people who died waiting , because that 's essentially what happened to them , " a spokesman for uk transplant said .
what now ?
back in the 1990s , even when human hearts were being donated at a relatively healthy rate , there was much faith in the pig as the organ donor of the future .
we heard talk of " organ farms " where genetically-engineered pigs would be reared and provide a virtually limitless supply of hearts , livers and kidneys .
yet the project became fraught with the old problems of rejection and viral transmission .
we were not quite as like pigs as we thought .
other non-human alternatives have been slow to develop , but many experts believe the mechanical pump , which is moderately successful at the moment , still holds out the most hope .
technical issues need to be overcome , but with the will and enough money , a fully effective version could be with us in the foreseeable future .
at the same time stem cells , which have yet to deliver on great promises , could one day grow us hearts in laboratories .
but at the moment there is nothing that beats the human heart .
the uk government is currently looking into turning our current system of " opting in " to being a donor , to " opting out " , where everybody is considered a donor unless they explicitly state otherwise .
but this is a thorny issue , and there are some who believe that no matter how many people are dying on waiting list , the suggestion that the state presume control of our bodies is one step too far .

survival rates one year : 80 % five years : 70 % ten years : 53 % while the typical donor used to be a 20-year-old man who had fallen off his motorbike , now he is much more likely to be a 55-year-old who smoked .

papworth hospital , where the first ever nhs transplant was carried out in 1979 , was recently given the all-clear following an inquiry into why seven out of 20 patients treated this year who died within 30 days of surgery .

what now ?
back in the 1990s , even when human hearts were being donated at a relatively healthy rate , there was much faith in the pig as the organ donor of the future .
we heard talk of " organ farms " where genetically-engineered pigs would be reared and provide a virtually limitless supply of hearts , livers and kidneys .
yet the project became fraught with the old problems of rejection and viral transmission .
we were not quite as like pigs as we thought .
other non-human alternatives have been slow to develop , but many experts believe the mechanical pump , which is moderately successful at the moment , still holds out the most hope .
technical issues need to be overcome , but with the will and enough money , a fully effective version could be with us in the foreseeable future .
at the same time stem cells , which have yet to deliver on great promises , could one day grow us hearts in laboratories .
but at the moment there is nothing that beats the human heart .
the uk government is currently looking into turning our current system of " opting in " to being a donor , to " opting out " , where everybody is considered a donor unless they explicitly state otherwise .
but this is a thorny issue , and there are some who believe that no matter how many people are dying on waiting list , the suggestion that the state presume control of our bodies is one step too far .

what would barnard say about transplantation today ?
admittedly , his patient lasted little longer than two weeks , but a huge medical advance had been made .
yet 40 years on , are we still advancing ?
well , here in the uk , not exactly .
heart transplantation in this country was at its peak about a decade ago .
then , over 350 such operations were carried out each year .
last year , less than half that number were performed .
dying differently it is not all bad news .
new techniques mean people with imperfect hearts can go longer without , potentially , ever needing a transplant .
waiting list 2006-2007 307 people on it at some point 28 died waiting for a heart 32 removed from list as too ill but without a doubt the figures also reflect a fall in the number of viable organ donors , even though the number of people registering themselves as organ donors continues to climb .
one of the problems - from the heart patient 's perspective - is that we are simply are not dying like we used to .
road accidents used to provide a rich seam of organs .
victims are usually healthy , often young , and the injuries sustained tend to be the head , not to other parts of the body .
but safety campaigns have had an impact , and the number of traffic deaths has fallen dramatically , seriously impinging on the number of organs available .
survival rates one year : 80 % five years : 70 % ten years : 53 % while the typical donor used to be a 20-year-old man who had fallen off his motorbike , now he is much more likely to be a 55-year-old who smoked .
less than perfect organs can be " repaired " , but the situation is not ideal .
papworth hospital , where the first ever nhs transplant was carried out in 1979 , was recently given the all-clear following an inquiry into why seven out of 20 patients treated this year who died within 30 days of surgery .
many random factors may have been involved , but the deaths did raise questions about the quality of organs currently being donated .
ill and waiting the commission which investigated the deaths also stressed that those being operated on were " extremely ill " to begin with .
i used to be operating on people who might still have years to live , but shortages now mean that only people in an absolutely critical condition are offered organs professor john dark but this in itself is a shift from the past .
" i used to be operating on people who might still have years to live , but shortages now mean that only people in an absolutely critical condition are offered organs , " says professor john dark , a heart surgeon who works at the freeman hospital in newcastle .
" the waiting list has fallen , but out of practical necessity .
people who would once have gone on the list just do n't get put on it anymore .
we deal only with the very , very sick . "
last year there were 307 people who at some point were on the waiting list .
of these , 28 died while waiting for a heart , and a further 32 were removed from the list because they were too ill to undergo treatment .
" you can add these last numbers to the people who died waiting , because that 's essentially what happened to them , " a spokesman for uk transplant said .
what now ?
back in the 1990s , even when human hearts were being donated at a relatively healthy rate , there was much faith in the pig as the organ donor of the future .
we heard talk of " organ farms " where genetically-engineered pigs would be reared and provide a virtually limitless supply of hearts , livers and kidneys .
yet the project became fraught with the old problems of rejection and viral transmission .
we were not quite as like pigs as we thought .
other non-human alternatives have been slow to develop , but many experts believe the mechanical pump , which is moderately successful at the moment , still holds out the most hope .
technical issues need to be overcome , but with the will and enough money , a fully effective version could be with us in the foreseeable future .
at the same time stem cells , which have yet to deliver on great promises , could one day grow us hearts in laboratories .
but at the moment there is nothing that beats the human heart .
the uk government is currently looking into turning our current system of " opting in " to being a donor , to " opting out " , where everybody is considered a donor unless they explicitly state otherwise .
but this is a thorny issue , and there are some who believe that no matter how many people are dying on waiting list , the suggestion that the state presume control of our bodies is one step too far .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- the obstacles to next-gen networks bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 3 december 2007 , 09:01 gmt the obstacles to next-gen networks by jane wakefield technology reporter , bbc news broadband speeds around the world broadband has been a huge success in the uk with more than half of all uk homes with a connection , at an average speed of four megabits a second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
but there are fears that the country is being left behind in the push towards next-generation networks .
the uk 's current broadband network is predominantly based on copper wires designed for telephone calls , and in the coming years the hardware will reach its technological limits , putting a cap of 24mbps download speeds on connections .
the technology , called adsl , also suffers from issues such as falling speeds with greater distance from the exchange , noise on the line , limited upload speeds and slowdown when more people are on the network .
a future download speed of 24mbps might sound fast , but other countries around the world are offering 40mbps and even 100mbps connections right now .
an extensive network of fibre optic cables has been touted as one solution but a uk-wide fibre to the home plan would cost £ 15bn to roll-out and some in the industry question the financial wisdom of such a network and whether it is needed at all .
commercial incentives bt , which operates the adsl network in the uk , has said it would need government assistance or commercial incentives before it could commit to building a next-generation network .
the uk 's sole cable provider , virgin media , is in the process of boosting its network in order to offer speeds of up to 50mbps to 52 % of the uk by the end of 2008 .
what will deliver next-generation broadband ?
without proper investment in next-generation broadband , users in the uk could miss out on the internet 's next major innovation , said ian fogg , an analyst at jupiter research .
" the next big thing on the internet - 2010 's youtube - may not work in the uk , " he warned .
one of the biggest issues is that no-one is really sure what " the next big thing " will be .
even if the uk did have a next-generation network ready to be switched on , how would it be used ?
in the us , fibre to the home networks are being used to deliver high definition tv services but in the uk sky and cable firms already offer hd programming , with freeview earmarked for hi-def content in the next five years .
others think that even if people did want high definition content delivered via broadband , they would not want to pay for it .
" the question is how to make money and i 'm not sure the answer is good .
take hd , people have already paid out £ 2,000 for a plasma tv and they see that as paying for hd .
they are not going to want to pay for the service as well , " said justin paul , a development manager at telecoms equipment firm alcatel-lucent .
faster upload the faster upload speeds offered by fibre could spur community networks that create and share video content and more bandwidth is always appreciated by online gamers .
but gaming is not going to be enough in itself to recoup the costs of either upgrading cable or investing the estimated £ 15bn needed .
one of the biggest issues facing the industry is how to make sure that any future fibre network was open to all internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to use .
it has taken a long time for this to become a reality on the copper network .
bt has offered wholesale products to isps for a long time , and ofcom would require this to continue on any new network , but many think real competition only began with the introduction of local loop unbundling .
local loop unbundling allowed other operators to put their equipment in telephone exchanges but it has been an extremely long and arduous process .
" the process started in 2000 but did n't really start to work until 2006 , " pointed out andrew heaney , director of strategy and regulation at carphone warehouse .
rival operators even now rival operators feel they are not getting their hands on enough of the network and are campaigning for greater access to bt 's core network .
" in france , italy and holland i can buy fibre to the exchange .
i ca n't buy that in the uk , " said simon gunter , head of strategy at uk isp tiscali .
in a fibre world it would be essential to have the same number of players as the current broadband market .
but the new way of unbundling - known as sub-loop unbundling - is even more fraught with problems .
it would require operators to share space in tiny street cabinets which some think is unfeasible .
some believe there is now a case for virgin media - the uk 's only cable operator - to offer its products on a wholesale basis .
ofcom does not require it to do so because it is not regarded as having sufficient market dominance .
there are also concerns that a fibre network would create another , wider digital divide with cities and towns well-served by fast networks while inhabitants outside large conurbations languish on much slower speeds .
fill-in solutions , such as long-distance wireless system wimax , would play a part as would community-generated schemes but even ofcom admits that some level of government funding would be necessary to reach the uk 's most remote areas .
some think the government should go further and fund the whole project .
" you have to put the spend in context .
the government is prepared to pay £ 16bn for crossrail , a project that will benefit just london .
a fibre network will cost £ 15bn and benefit the entire nation , " said carphone warehouse 's heaney .
mr gunter pointed out there was another option .
" do nothing is still an option .
virgin has been gifted a next generation network and they seem to be finding it hard to find the services for it .
imagine that with a £ 15bn debt against it , " he said .
and he added , there are still plenty of problems to be sorted out with existing broadband services .

but there are fears that the country is being left behind in the push towards next-generation networks .
the uk 's current broadband network is predominantly based on copper wires designed for telephone calls , and in the coming years the hardware will reach its technological limits , putting a cap of 24mbps download speeds on connections .
the technology , called adsl , also suffers from issues such as falling speeds with greater distance from the exchange , noise on the line , limited upload speeds and slowdown when more people are on the network .
a future download speed of 24mbps might sound fast , but other countries around the world are offering 40mbps and even 100mbps connections right now .
an extensive network of fibre optic cables has been touted as one solution but a uk-wide fibre to the home plan would cost £ 15bn to roll-out and some in the industry question the financial wisdom of such a network and whether it is needed at all .
commercial incentives bt , which operates the adsl network in the uk , has said it would need government assistance or commercial incentives before it could commit to building a next-generation network .
the uk 's sole cable provider , virgin media , is in the process of boosting its network in order to offer speeds of up to 50mbps to 52 % of the uk by the end of 2008 .
what will deliver next-generation broadband ?
without proper investment in next-generation broadband , users in the uk could miss out on the internet 's next major innovation , said ian fogg , an analyst at jupiter research .
" the next big thing on the internet - 2010 's youtube - may not work in the uk , " he warned .
one of the biggest issues is that no-one is really sure what " the next big thing " will be .
even if the uk did have a next-generation network ready to be switched on , how would it be used ?
in the us , fibre to the home networks are being used to deliver high definition tv services but in the uk sky and cable firms already offer hd programming , with freeview earmarked for hi-def content in the next five years .
others think that even if people did want high definition content delivered via broadband , they would not want to pay for it .
" the question is how to make money and i 'm not sure the answer is good .
take hd , people have already paid out £ 2,000 for a plasma tv and they see that as paying for hd .
they are not going to want to pay for the service as well , " said justin paul , a development manager at telecoms equipment firm alcatel-lucent .
faster upload the faster upload speeds offered by fibre could spur community networks that create and share video content and more bandwidth is always appreciated by online gamers .
but gaming is not going to be enough in itself to recoup the costs of either upgrading cable or investing the estimated £ 15bn needed .
a nationwide fibre roll-out would cost less than crossrail one of the biggest issues facing the industry is how to make sure that any future fibre network was open to all internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to use .
it has taken a long time for this to become a reality on the copper network .
bt has offered wholesale products to isps for a long time , and ofcom would require this to continue on any new network , but many think real competition only began with the introduction of local loop unbundling .
local loop unbundling allowed other operators to put their equipment in telephone exchanges but it has been an extremely long and arduous process .
" the process started in 2000 but did n't really start to work until 2006 , " pointed out andrew heaney , director of strategy and regulation at carphone warehouse .
rival operators even now rival operators feel they are not getting their hands on enough of the network and are campaigning for greater access to bt 's core network .
" in france , italy and holland i can buy fibre to the exchange .
i ca n't buy that in the uk , " said simon gunter , head of strategy at uk isp tiscali .
in a fibre world it would be essential to have the same number of players as the current broadband market .
but the new way of unbundling - known as sub-loop unbundling - is even more fraught with problems .
it would require operators to share space in tiny street cabinets which some think is unfeasible .
there are worries that laying fibre would re-open digital divide some believe there is now a case for virgin media - the uk 's only cable operator - to offer its products on a wholesale basis .
ofcom does not require it to do so because it is not regarded as having sufficient market dominance .
there are also concerns that a fibre network would create another , wider digital divide with cities and towns well-served by fast networks while inhabitants outside large conurbations languish on much slower speeds .
fill-in solutions , such as long-distance wireless system wimax , would play a part as would community-generated schemes but even ofcom admits that some level of government funding would be necessary to reach the uk 's most remote areas .
some think the government should go further and fund the whole project .
" you have to put the spend in context .
the government is prepared to pay £ 16bn for crossrail , a project that will benefit just london .
a fibre network will cost £ 15bn and benefit the entire nation , " said carphone warehouse 's heaney .
mr gunter pointed out there was another option .
" do nothing is still an option .
virgin has been gifted a next generation network and they seem to be finding it hard to find the services for it .
imagine that with a £ 15bn debt against it , " he said .
and he added , there are still plenty of problems to be sorted out with existing broadband services .
issues such as how easy it is for people to migrate to other providers , and the huge gap between advertised speeds and speeds people are actually getting , remain a sticking point for consumers .
" perhaps it is n't the wisest idea to move on to the next bright shiny new project without fixing this-generation issues , " he said .
