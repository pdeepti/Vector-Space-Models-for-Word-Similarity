"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .

there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .

he published pseudo-scientific claims that it was impossible that zyklon-b poison was used in the gas chambers at the nazis ' auschwitz death camp . he also said that he had found no evidence that the gas chambers used to kill hundreds of thousands of jews ever existed . deportation after escape to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf 's defense team sylvia stolz and npd lawyer horst mahler rudolf fled from germany to the united states in 1995 after a court handed him a suspended sentence of 14 months for whipping up anti-semitic sentiment . he applied for political asylum in the us in 2000 , but was rejected .
he was deported in 2005 to serve the 1995 sentence .
rudolf was arrested when he appeared at an immigration office in chicago to apply for a green card based on his marriage to a us citizen . he was charged again in april 2006 with " systematically " denying or playing down the nazi genocide of europe 's jews in documents and on the internet and of stirring anti-semitic hatred .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.03.2007 the " zen " of berlin : concentration and culture-shock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell discovered a bit of zen in berlin arden pennell has discovered that buddhist teachings are catching on in berlin .
missing the bus gave her a chance to practice zen-like mindfulness . the january opening of a church of scientology center in berlin has caused a stir of local concern about the “ brainwashing ” sect ’ s street-corner proselytizing .
meanwhile , the construction of a new mosque in pankow has riled up residents and right-wing politicians . yet alarmist fears and prejudiced indignation don ’ t interest me as much as another aspect of berlin ’ s religion-related happenings : the large buddhist community i have discovered here . the zen trend buddhism has become part of western leitkultur , from labeling a laid-back attitude as “ zen , ” as in , “ i wish i could be a little more zen about my work , ” to the smiling , seated buddha statuettes sold as trendy centerpieces , to richard gere ’ s “ free tibet ” campaigns with the dalai lama .
from slang to home furnishings to hollywood , buddhism pops up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin cathedral represents a different kind of religious tradition i didn ’ t come to germany to discover what lies beneath this superficial web of associations ; rather , the interest arose when i got here , causing me to wonder whether berlin was the right place to learn more .
the enormous , friendly , group of individuals i have since met has definitively proven that , although germans are allegedly less religious than ever , many have discovered a sort of non-dogma they can live by . in contrast to christianity and judaism , the two religions with the historically largest followings in germany , buddhism isn ’ t necessarily a faith-based system . it has a tradition of teachers who exhort their listeners to “ try it out ” before agreeing , and many major principles sound more like common sense than mysticism , which may be part of its appeal in europe ’ s “ god is dead ” era .
for example , the ideal of mindfulness , for which many adherents strive , simply describes the state of being fully present in the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagogue in berlin a recent magazine article about fun diversions for berliners suggested dabbling in mindfulness , only to conclude that being aware of your surroundings and the nice altbau architecture on the bike ride home was less efficient than mentally planning dinner . yet mindfulness isn ’ t about inefficiency - it ’ s about the power of non-fragmented attention to wake up to the surroundings . respond " mindfully " can be rewarding one morning , having forgotten as i usually do to turn off the heat in my apartment - not something i ’ m used to from growing up with building-wide controlled heating in new york - i ran back in to turn the knob and missed the impeccably punctual bus by about ten seconds . i began fuming , but instead of going with it , i tried to be mindful , taking a deep breath and thinking , “ hello , fuming .
what else is there in this minute alongside you ? ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell did n't have to worry about turning off the heating in new york city to al gore ’ s probable horror , i noticed it was an unseasonably warm and beautiful day . missing the bus was a great chance to walk to the next stop and enjoy the weather .

missing the bus gave her a chance to practice zen-like mindfulness . the january opening of a church of scientology center in berlin has caused a stir of local concern about the “ brainwashing ” sect ’ s street-corner proselytizing .
meanwhile , the construction of a new mosque in pankow has riled up residents and right-wing politicians . yet alarmist fears and prejudiced indignation don ’ t interest me as much as another aspect of berlin ’ s religion-related happenings : the large buddhist community i have discovered here . the zen trend buddhism has become part of western leitkultur , from labeling a laid-back attitude as “ zen , ” as in , “ i wish i could be a little more zen about my work , ” to the smiling , seated buddha statuettes sold as trendy centerpieces , to richard gere ’ s “ free tibet ” campaigns with the dalai lama .
from slang to home furnishings to hollywood , buddhism pops up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin cathedral represents a different kind of religious tradition i didn ’ t come to germany to discover what lies beneath this superficial web of associations ; rather , the interest arose when i got here , causing me to wonder whether berlin was the right place to learn more .
the enormous , friendly , group of individuals i have since met has definitively proven that , although germans are allegedly less religious than ever , many have discovered a sort of non-dogma they can live by . in contrast to christianity and judaism , the two religions with the historically largest followings in germany , buddhism isn ’ t necessarily a faith-based system . it has a tradition of teachers who exhort their listeners to “ try it out ” before agreeing , and many major principles sound more like common sense than mysticism , which may be part of its appeal in europe ’ s “ god is dead ” era .
for example , the ideal of mindfulness , for which many adherents strive , simply describes the state of being fully present in the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagogue in berlin a recent magazine article about fun diversions for berliners suggested dabbling in mindfulness , only to conclude that being aware of your surroundings and the nice altbau architecture on the bike ride home was less efficient than mentally planning dinner . yet mindfulness isn ’ t about inefficiency - it ’ s about the power of non-fragmented attention to wake up to the surroundings . respond " mindfully " can be rewarding one morning , having forgotten as i usually do to turn off the heat in my apartment - not something i ’ m used to from growing up with building-wide controlled heating in new york - i ran back in to turn the knob and missed the impeccably punctual bus by about ten seconds . i began fuming , but instead of going with it , i tried to be mindful , taking a deep breath and thinking , “ hello , fuming .
what else is there in this minute alongside you ? ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell did n't have to worry about turning off the heating in new york city to al gore ’ s probable horror , i noticed it was an unseasonably warm and beautiful day . missing the bus was a great chance to walk to the next stop and enjoy the weather .
in other words , i paid a little attention to what was going on parallel to my own bundle of nerves and felt rewarded . mindfulness isn ’ t going to turn me into a completely “ zen ” individual any time soon , especially since living abroad seems to be a continual adaptation process , not one that eventually slows .
but by increasing self-awareness , it is a useful tool for better responding to the occasional frustration of living as a foreigner , such as not remembering how to express certain ideas in german or suffering through the lines at the ausländerbehörde -lrb- public office for foreigners -rrb- . now if i could just figure out how to respond mindfully to those scientology solicitors accosting passers-by outside of kadewe … arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns memory , one piece at a time after literally stumbling over a holocaust memorial in berlin , arden pennell investigated the history of berlin 's " stumbling stones .

" the results of the reconnaissance flights will be used directly to support the combat led by ground troops and fighter aircraft , " they said . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe on friday rejected their argument as " false . " opponents ' argument the same claim was made by political opponents of the tornado mission , which was approved by parliament last week with 405 votes to 157 . the german military has 2,750 soldiers in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , but has resisted pressure from nato allies to extend its mandate to the south where they would likely face combat against the taliban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some soliders in afghanistan are worried about " mission creep " raabe confirmed reports that an officer who organizes logistical support for german forces in afghanistan has filed an application asking to be relieved of these duties because he had misgivings about the tornado deployment . the soldier argues that the mission might contravene both the german constitution and international law . controversial the mission has sparked considerable controversy in germany . the nation remains wary of sending troops into combat six decades after the end of world war ii and a recent poll showed that 77 percent of germans did not want the tornados sent to afghanistan . two conservative mps launched a court application to stop the deployment but it was rejected . a group linked to al qaeda last sunday warned germany and austria that their presence in afghanistan has made the countries targets for militant attacks . another militant group said it would kill a german woman and her son being held hostage in iraq unless berlin began withdrawing its soldiers from afghanistan within 10 days . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects bid to block tornado mission in afghanistan germany 's constitutional court rejected a bid by two conservative representatives to block berlin 's deployment of tornado jets in afghanistan in support of nato 's offensive against the taliban .

meanwhile , the construction of a new mosque in pankow has riled up residents and right-wing politicians . yet alarmist fears and prejudiced indignation don ’ t interest me as much as another aspect of berlin ’ s religion-related happenings : the large buddhist community i have discovered here . the zen trend buddhism has become part of western leitkultur , from labeling a laid-back attitude as “ zen , ” as in , “ i wish i could be a little more zen about my work , ” to the smiling , seated buddha statuettes sold as trendy centerpieces , to richard gere ’ s “ free tibet ” campaigns with the dalai lama .
from slang to home furnishings to hollywood , buddhism pops up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin cathedral represents a different kind of religious tradition i didn ’ t come to germany to discover what lies beneath this superficial web of associations ; rather , the interest arose when i got here , causing me to wonder whether berlin was the right place to learn more .
the enormous , friendly , group of individuals i have since met has definitively proven that , although germans are allegedly less religious than ever , many have discovered a sort of non-dogma they can live by . in contrast to christianity and judaism , the two religions with the historically largest followings in germany , buddhism isn ’ t necessarily a faith-based system . it has a tradition of teachers who exhort their listeners to “ try it out ” before agreeing , and many major principles sound more like common sense than mysticism , which may be part of its appeal in europe ’ s “ god is dead ” era .
for example , the ideal of mindfulness , for which many adherents strive , simply describes the state of being fully present in the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagogue in berlin a recent magazine article about fun diversions for berliners suggested dabbling in mindfulness , only to conclude that being aware of your surroundings and the nice altbau architecture on the bike ride home was less efficient than mentally planning dinner . yet mindfulness isn ’ t about inefficiency - it ’ s about the power of non-fragmented attention to wake up to the surroundings . respond " mindfully " can be rewarding one morning , having forgotten as i usually do to turn off the heat in my apartment - not something i ’ m used to from growing up with building-wide controlled heating in new york - i ran back in to turn the knob and missed the impeccably punctual bus by about ten seconds . i began fuming , but instead of going with it , i tried to be mindful , taking a deep breath and thinking , “ hello , fuming .
what else is there in this minute alongside you ? ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell did n't have to worry about turning off the heating in new york city to al gore ’ s probable horror , i noticed it was an unseasonably warm and beautiful day . missing the bus was a great chance to walk to the next stop and enjoy the weather .
in other words , i paid a little attention to what was going on parallel to my own bundle of nerves and felt rewarded . mindfulness isn ’ t going to turn me into a completely “ zen ” individual any time soon , especially since living abroad seems to be a continual adaptation process , not one that eventually slows .
but by increasing self-awareness , it is a useful tool for better responding to the occasional frustration of living as a foreigner , such as not remembering how to express certain ideas in german or suffering through the lines at the ausländerbehörde -lrb- public office for foreigners -rrb- . now if i could just figure out how to respond mindfully to those scientology solicitors accosting passers-by outside of kadewe … arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns memory , one piece at a time after literally stumbling over a holocaust memorial in berlin , arden pennell investigated the history of berlin 's " stumbling stones .

" the results of the reconnaissance flights will be used directly to support the combat led by ground troops and fighter aircraft , " they said . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe on friday rejected their argument as " false . " opponents ' argument the same claim was made by political opponents of the tornado mission , which was approved by parliament last week with 405 votes to 157 . the german military has 2,750 soldiers in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , but has resisted pressure from nato allies to extend its mandate to the south where they would likely face combat against the taliban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some soliders in afghanistan are worried about " mission creep " raabe confirmed reports that an officer who organizes logistical support for german forces in afghanistan has filed an application asking to be relieved of these duties because he had misgivings about the tornado deployment . the soldier argues that the mission might contravene both the german constitution and international law . controversial the mission has sparked considerable controversy in germany . the nation remains wary of sending troops into combat six decades after the end of world war ii and a recent poll showed that 77 percent of germans did not want the tornados sent to afghanistan . two conservative mps launched a court application to stop the deployment but it was rejected . a group linked to al qaeda last sunday warned germany and austria that their presence in afghanistan has made the countries targets for militant attacks . another militant group said it would kill a german woman and her son being held hostage in iraq unless berlin began withdrawing its soldiers from afghanistan within 10 days . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects bid to block tornado mission in afghanistan germany 's constitutional court rejected a bid by two conservative representatives to block berlin 's deployment of tornado jets in afghanistan in support of nato 's offensive against the taliban .

german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

" we have shown today that workers at the european level are speaking with a single voice , " declared peter scherrer , head of the european metalworking federation , speaking in paris outside the headquarters of airbus parent company eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday demonstration in blagnac near toulouse , southwestern france in hamburg in germany , 42-year-old johannes budde , who has worked for airbus for 18 years , said worker solidarity was the key to forcing management to scrap the overhaul , dubbed power8 .

" despite our success , they 're cutting jobs .
but this demonstration sends a good signal to management - they have to understand that without us they ca n't work . " organizers said 25,000 people turned out for demonstrations in hamburg and elsewhere in germany , 7,000 in toulouse , where airbus is headquartered , 4,000 at three other sites in france and 9,000 at seven spanish locations . police estimated the gathering at 10,000 in hamburg and 5,500 in toulouse . airbus : cuts are needed airbus insists that its financial and production difficulties are " extremely serious " and that it can no longer delay making cost savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human chain surrounds the airbus site at laupheim the cuts , together with the total or partial disposal of six sites , are intended to save 5.0 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and pull the company out of a crisis caused by delays to its a380 superjumbo program , seen as critical to airbus ' bid to catch up with us rival boeing . the job losses will target airbus production sites in france , germany , spain and britain .

" daniel friedrich , a spokesman for the powerful german union ig metall , said support from the german federal government would be necessary to force airbus bosses to rescind power8 . he added that it was now up to airbus management to unveil the finer points in the plan , after which " we will be able to propose better solutions , which will takes weeks or months .

" led by poland 's euro-sceptic identical twins , president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , warsaw last month urged the eu to ditch attempts to revive the constitution which was put on ice two years ago when french and dutch voters rejected it . " the time for reflection is past .
it 's time for decisions .
i pledge that there will be a roadmap to move forward -lrb- with the constitution -rrb- by the end of the german presidency , " in june , merkel said . " it is not only in europe 's interest but also in the interest of member states and citizens of europe that this process is taken to a positive end by the next european elections in 2009 . " failure to do this would be a historic missed opportunity , " merkel said . do n't dwell on , or forget , the past she urged poland to leave behind - but not forget - past tensions with germany and move forward with its central european neighbor for a stronger europe . " as pope john paul ii said , it is god 's will that germany and poland are neighbours .
as neighbors , we have a duty and responsibility to live well together , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been high between poland and germany lately " for germany and poland to live well together , today and in future , we must draw lessons from the darkest period in our history , " she said , referring to world war ii , during which " more than six million poles lost their lives because of the germans . " germans must not only accept their nation 's dark past but also be allowed to mourn it , merkel said . " as german chancellor , i understand and support the germans who at the end of world war ii were painfully forced from their homeland , and their right to look back on their fate with dignity , " she said in her speech in the polish capital , a city almost entirely destroyed by the nazis at the end of the war . expellees addressed gnawing at relations between poland and germany is the issue of germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history . " dignity would , to my mind , come from not just the germans who were expelled or fled , but also all others , including poles , being allowed to remember their pain and , above all , for it to be made clear that history can not and will not be rewritten , " merkel said . christian question europeans are united by common values , she said , but failed to go as far as the leaders of catholic poland who want references to christianity to be included in a statement set to be issued to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding treaty of rome next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is still very strong in poland " europe is not a ' christian club ' , as some would like to say .
but europe is founded on values that are clearly grounded in the christian vision of humanity , " said merkel . poles and germans must " keep working to make old fears , worries and even prejudices disappear , " but assured that " a lot of hard work has already been done , " the german chancellor said . " there is only one way forward : do n't act alone but as part of a united europe , which is also a strong europe . " merkel left warsaw after the speech for the polish presidential retreat in the baltic seaside resort of hel , where she is due to hold closed-door talks on saturday with the polish president . dw staff -lrb- afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .

but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .

ahmadinejad : " security council has no legitimacy " a defiant ahmadinejad , who insists tehran 's nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , earlier thursday dismissed the new sanctions package and slammed the security council . " today the enemies of the iranian people are seeking to use the security council to prevent the progress and development of iran .
but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions . " no military action the new un draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by the security council in december after tehran spurned repeated un demands to freeze uranium enrichment , a possible pathway to nuclear weapons .

i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .

"
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .

i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .
or being completely in awe of kylie , in her days of frizzy perms and high-waist , drainpipe jeans . bildunterschrift : faith dennis now owns robin hood boots to us , 80s clothes are like the " blankies " of our twenties , familiar and comforting . faith gives in to " the blankie " that ’ s not to say there hasn ’ t been a resistance , just like the advent of mobile phones which had us divided into two camps in the 90 ’ s ; those who thought they were just for show-offs , and those who liked showing off with them . i was in the former camp for a long time , until one day i buckled and joined the " other side . "
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .

" we have shown today that workers at the european level are speaking with a single voice , " declared peter scherrer , head of the european metalworking federation , speaking in paris outside the headquarters of airbus parent company eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday demonstration in blagnac near toulouse , southwestern france in hamburg in germany , 42-year-old johannes budde , who has worked for airbus for 18 years , said worker solidarity was the key to forcing management to scrap the overhaul , dubbed power8 . " it 's only in standing shoulder to shoulder that we will be able to demonstrate our strength to management , " he said , noting in anger that airbus wanted to slash jobs at a time when its books were healthy . " despite our success , they 're cutting jobs .

" the results of the reconnaissance flights will be used directly to support the combat led by ground troops and fighter aircraft , " they said . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe on friday rejected their argument as " false . " opponents ' argument the same claim was made by political opponents of the tornado mission , which was approved by parliament last week with 405 votes to 157 . the german military has 2,750 soldiers in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , but has resisted pressure from nato allies to extend its mandate to the south where they would likely face combat against the taliban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some soliders in afghanistan are worried about " mission creep " raabe confirmed reports that an officer who organizes logistical support for german forces in afghanistan has filed an application asking to be relieved of these duties because he had misgivings about the tornado deployment . the soldier argues that the mission might contravene both the german constitution and international law . controversial the mission has sparked considerable controversy in germany . the nation remains wary of sending troops into combat six decades after the end of world war ii and a recent poll showed that 77 percent of germans did not want the tornados sent to afghanistan . two conservative mps launched a court application to stop the deployment but it was rejected . a group linked to al qaeda last sunday warned germany and austria that their presence in afghanistan has made the countries targets for militant attacks . another militant group said it would kill a german woman and her son being held hostage in iraq unless berlin began withdrawing its soldiers from afghanistan within 10 days . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects bid to block tornado mission in afghanistan germany 's constitutional court rejected a bid by two conservative representatives to block berlin 's deployment of tornado jets in afghanistan in support of nato 's offensive against the taliban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.03.2007 chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " whose turn is it to cause outrage ? "
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.03.2007 chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " whose turn is it to cause outrage ? "
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach .

by providing faster services , coupled with rising concern over the environmental impact of no-frills air travel , railway operators hope that customers will return to train travel . deutsche bahn 's european hub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new central station is seen as europe 's new hub deutsche bahn , the german railways operator , hope that its state-of-the-art new main station in berlin will act as a european hub for rail travel , and change the minds of those travelers who consider budget flights as their best option for reaching european cities .
in brussels , a modernization of the midi station into a true international hub serving the eurostar , tgv , thalys and ice services hope to have the same effect in the capital of the eu . the eu itself has come up with initiatives to open the rail market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems across the continent in line with each other on all major tracks in an attempt to increase efficiency and choice . european countries have been waking up to the need for bigger and better train systems for a number of years .
work began five years ago on the state-of-the-art paris-strasbourg tgv line , which opens to the public on june 10 .
one of the biggest rail projects in europe , it mobilized some 10,000 workers and required 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers . last month , it was on the paris-strasbourg line that the tgv broke its own world record by hitting a peak speed of 553 kilometers per hour during a test run .
it is to attempt a new high-velocity breakthrough in the coming weeks . new fast trains countering airline popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tgvs will cut journey times dramatically the new train will cut the paris-strasbourg trip to two hours and 20 minutes from the current four hours .
it will also slash travel time to points further east , making the trip from paris to luxembourg in about two hours , to frankfurt in less than four and to munich in six hours and fifteen minutes . " some 37 million europeans can be reached , " said tgv-est director alain le guellec .
" a network of high-speed links is being put into place with the rest of europe . " president jacques chirac thursday hailed the new rail service as a " major industry success , " saying it would generate economic growth and jobs . " this admirably demonstrates france 's capabilities in research , development and innovation , " chirac said , lauding trains as faster , cheaper and greener than planes . perben announced on monday that the second phase of construction - which will knock another half-hour off the journey time from paris to strasbourg , to one hour 50 minutes - would be brought forward from 2010 to 2008 . but there are doubts over whether the rail service will be commercially viable . the project cost of four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- is being shared among 22 financial partners at various levels of the french government , as well as luxembourg , the european union and the french state-owned railway sncf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees to partly privatize railway system germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to partly privatize the country 's federal rail system by 2009 , government officials announced on wednesday in berlin after months of wrangling .

by providing faster services , coupled with rising concern over the environmental impact of no-frills air travel , railway operators hope that customers will return to train travel . deutsche bahn 's european hub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new central station is seen as europe 's new hub deutsche bahn , the german railways operator , hope that its state-of-the-art new main station in berlin will act as a european hub for rail travel , and change the minds of those travelers who consider budget flights as their best option for reaching european cities .
in brussels , a modernization of the midi station into a true international hub serving the eurostar , tgv , thalys and ice services hope to have the same effect in the capital of the eu . the eu itself has come up with initiatives to open the rail market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems across the continent in line with each other on all major tracks in an attempt to increase efficiency and choice . european countries have been waking up to the need for bigger and better train systems for a number of years .
work began five years ago on the state-of-the-art paris-strasbourg tgv line , which opens to the public on june 10 .
one of the biggest rail projects in europe , it mobilized some 10,000 workers and required 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers . last month , it was on the paris-strasbourg line that the tgv broke its own world record by hitting a peak speed of 553 kilometers per hour during a test run .
it is to attempt a new high-velocity breakthrough in the coming weeks . new fast trains countering airline popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tgvs will cut journey times dramatically the new train will cut the paris-strasbourg trip to two hours and 20 minutes from the current four hours .
it will also slash travel time to points further east , making the trip from paris to luxembourg in about two hours , to frankfurt in less than four and to munich in six hours and fifteen minutes . " some 37 million europeans can be reached , " said tgv-est director alain le guellec .
" a network of high-speed links is being put into place with the rest of europe . " president jacques chirac thursday hailed the new rail service as a " major industry success , " saying it would generate economic growth and jobs . " this admirably demonstrates france 's capabilities in research , development and innovation , " chirac said , lauding trains as faster , cheaper and greener than planes . perben announced on monday that the second phase of construction - which will knock another half-hour off the journey time from paris to strasbourg , to one hour 50 minutes - would be brought forward from 2010 to 2008 . but there are doubts over whether the rail service will be commercially viable . the project cost of four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- is being shared among 22 financial partners at various levels of the french government , as well as luxembourg , the european union and the french state-owned railway sncf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees to partly privatize railway system germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to partly privatize the country 's federal rail system by 2009 , government officials announced on wednesday in berlin after months of wrangling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.03.2007 chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " whose turn is it to cause outrage ? "
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .

" the results of the reconnaissance flights will be used directly to support the combat led by ground troops and fighter aircraft , " they said . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe on friday rejected their argument as " false . " opponents ' argument the same claim was made by political opponents of the tornado mission , which was approved by parliament last week with 405 votes to 157 . the german military has 2,750 soldiers in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , but has resisted pressure from nato allies to extend its mandate to the south where they would likely face combat against the taliban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some soliders in afghanistan are worried about " mission creep " raabe confirmed reports that an officer who organizes logistical support for german forces in afghanistan has filed an application asking to be relieved of these duties because he had misgivings about the tornado deployment . the soldier argues that the mission might contravene both the german constitution and international law . controversial the mission has sparked considerable controversy in germany . the nation remains wary of sending troops into combat six decades after the end of world war ii and a recent poll showed that 77 percent of germans did not want the tornados sent to afghanistan . two conservative mps launched a court application to stop the deployment but it was rejected . a group linked to al qaeda last sunday warned germany and austria that their presence in afghanistan has made the countries targets for militant attacks . another militant group said it would kill a german woman and her son being held hostage in iraq unless berlin began withdrawing its soldiers from afghanistan within 10 days . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects bid to block tornado mission in afghanistan germany 's constitutional court rejected a bid by two conservative representatives to block berlin 's deployment of tornado jets in afghanistan in support of nato 's offensive against the taliban .

" in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .
operators ignore issue earlier german economics minister michael glos , whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , said " the will to reach an accord on roaming was demonstrated " at the meeting .
" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .
" but in the process of dealing with the matter , competition among the operators and the incentives for innovation must not be endangered . " the ministers voiced their support for structuring the rules as simply as possible and keeping potential bureaucratic hurdles to a minimum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has been deaf to calls to give consumers a break thursday 's gathering was the last before a formal ministers ' meeting in brussels june 6 and 7 . the european parliament will vote in may on the issue , amid serious strain between telecommunications firms and the european commission . the commission , stating a goal of driving down roaming charges by 70 percent , put forward proposals in july for reducing the rates .
frustrated that operators had paid little heed to calls for lower roaming fees - a surcharge that the eu estimates brings in 8.5 billion euros each year - the commission suggested fixing the wholesale roaming rates that mobile phone companies charge each other . it also proposed to cap the retail rates that companies can impose , as well as the cost of calls received abroad .
merkel could win points with public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel could claim victory if vacationers can enjoy cheaper rates a final area that still requires a compromise is the cost of calls made locally with a foreign cell phone , for example if a german tourist calls a taxi in france .
the commission has proposed a maximum charge on such calls of 33 euro cents per minute . germany has set the target of getting a roaming deal under its eu presidency , running until the end of june , so holidaymakers can enjoy cheaper rates while abroad next summer . " that would be a great victory for the -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency of -lrb- chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , " reding said . dw staff 7 afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european mobile phone companies vow to ensure safe content european mobile phone operators and content providers have signed a new european union voluntary code of conduct to help protect children from harmful content .

he had on the " so now " 80s get up , mixed with a touch of heroin chic : scruffy converse all-stars , skintight navy blue jeans , a white shirt and black tie , nicely complimented by his greasy hair , which hung sweatily in his eyes , and of course the obligatory cigarette dangling from his mouth . people weren ’ t dancing initially , which was either because they were too cool , or perhaps because the music was a bit clunky and not easy to dance to unless you had robotic limbs .
however , when the second band did an electro cover of sinead o ’ connor ’ s 80s classic “ nothing compares 2 u , ” the crowd went wild , singing along and swaying happily .
total 80 ’ s overload . saved from the dumpster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does 80s fashion belong here ?
i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .
or being completely in awe of kylie , in her days of frizzy perms and high-waist , drainpipe jeans . bildunterschrift : faith dennis now owns robin hood boots to us , 80s clothes are like the " blankies " of our twenties , familiar and comforting . faith gives in to " the blankie " that ’ s not to say there hasn ’ t been a resistance , just like the advent of mobile phones which had us divided into two camps in the 90 ’ s ; those who thought they were just for show-offs , and those who liked showing off with them . i was in the former camp for a long time , until one day i buckled and joined the " other side . "
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .

the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week .

ahmadinejad : " security council has no legitimacy " a defiant ahmadinejad , who insists tehran 's nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , earlier thursday dismissed the new sanctions package and slammed the security council . " today the enemies of the iranian people are seeking to use the security council to prevent the progress and development of iran .
but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions . " no military action the new un draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by the security council in december after tehran spurned repeated un demands to freeze uranium enrichment , a possible pathway to nuclear weapons .
those measures included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to the islamic republic and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work .

it also urges voluntary restrictions on " new commitments for grants , financial assistance and loans to iran " as well as extending an assets freeze to additional entities and individuals linked to iran 's nuclear and missile programs . the text would give iran 60 days to comply with repeated un demands or face " further appropriate measures " -lrb- economic sanctions but no military action -rrb- under article 41 of the un charter . visiting french prime minister dominique de villepin told reporters here that tehran had a choice between accepting its " international obligations concerning enrichment " or sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shrugs off threat of more united nations sanctions iran has shrugged off the threat of additional un security council sanctions over its nuclear program .

he had on the " so now " 80s get up , mixed with a touch of heroin chic : scruffy converse all-stars , skintight navy blue jeans , a white shirt and black tie , nicely complimented by his greasy hair , which hung sweatily in his eyes , and of course the obligatory cigarette dangling from his mouth . people weren ’ t dancing initially , which was either because they were too cool , or perhaps because the music was a bit clunky and not easy to dance to unless you had robotic limbs .
however , when the second band did an electro cover of sinead o ’ connor ’ s 80s classic “ nothing compares 2 u , ” the crowd went wild , singing along and swaying happily .
total 80 ’ s overload . saved from the dumpster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does 80s fashion belong here ?
i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .
or being completely in awe of kylie , in her days of frizzy perms and high-waist , drainpipe jeans . bildunterschrift : faith dennis now owns robin hood boots to us , 80s clothes are like the " blankies " of our twenties , familiar and comforting . faith gives in to " the blankie " that ’ s not to say there hasn ’ t been a resistance , just like the advent of mobile phones which had us divided into two camps in the 90 ’ s ; those who thought they were just for show-offs , and those who liked showing off with them . i was in the former camp for a long time , until one day i buckled and joined the " other side . "
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .

" we have shown today that workers at the european level are speaking with a single voice , " declared peter scherrer , head of the european metalworking federation , speaking in paris outside the headquarters of airbus parent company eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday demonstration in blagnac near toulouse , southwestern france in hamburg in germany , 42-year-old johannes budde , who has worked for airbus for 18 years , said worker solidarity was the key to forcing management to scrap the overhaul , dubbed power8 . " it 's only in standing shoulder to shoulder that we will be able to demonstrate our strength to management , " he said , noting in anger that airbus wanted to slash jobs at a time when its books were healthy . " despite our success , they 're cutting jobs .
but this demonstration sends a good signal to management - they have to understand that without us they ca n't work . " organizers said 25,000 people turned out for demonstrations in hamburg and elsewhere in germany , 7,000 in toulouse , where airbus is headquartered , 4,000 at three other sites in france and 9,000 at seven spanish locations . police estimated the gathering at 10,000 in hamburg and 5,500 in toulouse . airbus : cuts are needed airbus insists that its financial and production difficulties are " extremely serious " and that it can no longer delay making cost savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human chain surrounds the airbus site at laupheim the cuts , together with the total or partial disposal of six sites , are intended to save 5.0 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and pull the company out of a crisis caused by delays to its a380 superjumbo program , seen as critical to airbus ' bid to catch up with us rival boeing . the job losses will target airbus production sites in france , germany , spain and britain .
management has also blamed the strong euro , which makes its products less competitive on world markets and reduces the value of its dollar-based sales , on the manufacturer 's financial woes . eads , the european aeronautic defence and space company , last week published results revealing a first-ever operating loss at its airbus unit of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2005 . franco-german tensions announcement of the restructuring on february 28 came amid tension between french and german interests , which dominate eads , over where cuts should fall . in the german state of lower saxony where airbus has two sites , regional premier christian wulff voiced support friday for the workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 superjumbo taxies on the tarmac in france but in remarks pointing to underlying tensions between german and french interests over the plan , hamburg senator gunnar uldall complained that as french politicians and unions had " turned airbus into a national project , we have to do the same . " daniel friedrich , a spokesman for the powerful german union ig metall , said support from the german federal government would be necessary to force airbus bosses to rescind power8 . he added that it was now up to airbus management to unveil the finer points in the plan , after which " we will be able to propose better solutions , which will takes weeks or months . " good news airbus on thursday received a much needed boost to its business and credibility when two customers pledged new orders worth 23 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- . qatar airways said it planned to buy 80 a350 jets for $ 17.2 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices , one of the biggest orders in the history of airbus , and russian airline aeroflot said it would sign a deal for 22 more of the same aircraft . the contracts would be a huge win for the mid-sized , long-haul a350 plane , which was withdrawn and relaunched by airbus as the a350xwb last year because of poor feedback on the original version from potential customers . eads shares closed higher friday , gaining 1.38 percent to reach 22.05 euros on the paris exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus workers across europe to down tools friday tens of thousands of airbus workers are expected to walk off the job on friday in an unusual europe-wide labor action against plans by the struggling aircraft manufacturer to slash 10,000 posts in four countries .

" in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .
operators ignore issue earlier german economics minister michael glos , whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , said " the will to reach an accord on roaming was demonstrated " at the meeting .
" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .

he had on the " so now " 80s get up , mixed with a touch of heroin chic : scruffy converse all-stars , skintight navy blue jeans , a white shirt and black tie , nicely complimented by his greasy hair , which hung sweatily in his eyes , and of course the obligatory cigarette dangling from his mouth . people weren ’ t dancing initially , which was either because they were too cool , or perhaps because the music was a bit clunky and not easy to dance to unless you had robotic limbs .
however , when the second band did an electro cover of sinead o ’ connor ’ s 80s classic “ nothing compares 2 u , ” the crowd went wild , singing along and swaying happily .
total 80 ’ s overload . saved from the dumpster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does 80s fashion belong here ?
i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .
or being completely in awe of kylie , in her days of frizzy perms and high-waist , drainpipe jeans . bildunterschrift : faith dennis now owns robin hood boots to us , 80s clothes are like the " blankies " of our twenties , familiar and comforting . faith gives in to " the blankie " that ’ s not to say there hasn ’ t been a resistance , just like the advent of mobile phones which had us divided into two camps in the 90 ’ s ; those who thought they were just for show-offs , and those who liked showing off with them . i was in the former camp for a long time , until one day i buckled and joined the " other side . "
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .

" led by poland 's euro-sceptic identical twins , president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , warsaw last month urged the eu to ditch attempts to revive the constitution which was put on ice two years ago when french and dutch voters rejected it . " the time for reflection is past .
it 's time for decisions .
i pledge that there will be a roadmap to move forward -lrb- with the constitution -rrb- by the end of the german presidency , " in june , merkel said . " it is not only in europe 's interest but also in the interest of member states and citizens of europe that this process is taken to a positive end by the next european elections in 2009 . " failure to do this would be a historic missed opportunity , " merkel said . do n't dwell on , or forget , the past she urged poland to leave behind - but not forget - past tensions with germany and move forward with its central european neighbor for a stronger europe . " as pope john paul ii said , it is god 's will that germany and poland are neighbours .
as neighbors , we have a duty and responsibility to live well together , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been high between poland and germany lately " for germany and poland to live well together , today and in future , we must draw lessons from the darkest period in our history , " she said , referring to world war ii , during which " more than six million poles lost their lives because of the germans . " germans must not only accept their nation 's dark past but also be allowed to mourn it , merkel said . " as german chancellor , i understand and support the germans who at the end of world war ii were painfully forced from their homeland , and their right to look back on their fate with dignity , " she said in her speech in the polish capital , a city almost entirely destroyed by the nazis at the end of the war . expellees addressed gnawing at relations between poland and germany is the issue of germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history . " dignity would , to my mind , come from not just the germans who were expelled or fled , but also all others , including poles , being allowed to remember their pain and , above all , for it to be made clear that history can not and will not be rewritten , " merkel said . christian question europeans are united by common values , she said , but failed to go as far as the leaders of catholic poland who want references to christianity to be included in a statement set to be issued to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding treaty of rome next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is still very strong in poland " europe is not a ' christian club ' , as some would like to say .
but europe is founded on values that are clearly grounded in the christian vision of humanity , " said merkel . poles and germans must " keep working to make old fears , worries and even prejudices disappear , " but assured that " a lot of hard work has already been done , " the german chancellor said . " there is only one way forward : do n't act alone but as part of a united europe , which is also a strong europe .

by providing faster services , coupled with rising concern over the environmental impact of no-frills air travel , railway operators hope that customers will return to train travel . deutsche bahn 's european hub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new central station is seen as europe 's new hub deutsche bahn , the german railways operator , hope that its state-of-the-art new main station in berlin will act as a european hub for rail travel , and change the minds of those travelers who consider budget flights as their best option for reaching european cities .
in brussels , a modernization of the midi station into a true international hub serving the eurostar , tgv , thalys and ice services hope to have the same effect in the capital of the eu . the eu itself has come up with initiatives to open the rail market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems across the continent in line with each other on all major tracks in an attempt to increase efficiency and choice . european countries have been waking up to the need for bigger and better train systems for a number of years .
work began five years ago on the state-of-the-art paris-strasbourg tgv line , which opens to the public on june 10 .
one of the biggest rail projects in europe , it mobilized some 10,000 workers and required 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers . last month , it was on the paris-strasbourg line that the tgv broke its own world record by hitting a peak speed of 553 kilometers per hour during a test run .

it will also slash travel time to points further east , making the trip from paris to luxembourg in about two hours , to frankfurt in less than four and to munich in six hours and fifteen minutes . " some 37 million europeans can be reached , " said tgv-est director alain le guellec .
" a network of high-speed links is being put into place with the rest of europe . " president jacques chirac thursday hailed the new rail service as a " major industry success , " saying it would generate economic growth and jobs . " this admirably demonstrates france 's capabilities in research , development and innovation , " chirac said , lauding trains as faster , cheaper and greener than planes . perben announced on monday that the second phase of construction - which will knock another half-hour off the journey time from paris to strasbourg , to one hour 50 minutes - would be brought forward from 2010 to 2008 . but there are doubts over whether the rail service will be commercially viable . the project cost of four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- is being shared among 22 financial partners at various levels of the french government , as well as luxembourg , the european union and the french state-owned railway sncf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees to partly privatize railway system germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to partly privatize the country 's federal rail system by 2009 , government officials announced on wednesday in berlin after months of wrangling .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .
in washington , the white house said us president george w. bush hoped for a vote " soon . "
confrontation programmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad news of the agreement set the stage for a dramatic confrontation with president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who formally asked to attend the council meeting when the sanctions come up for a vote . " he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- wants to come when the resolution is being adopted , " said south african ambassador dumisani kumalo , who chairs the council this month .
kumalo earlier said a vote could come next week .
ahmadinejad : " security council has no legitimacy " a defiant ahmadinejad , who insists tehran 's nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , earlier thursday dismissed the new sanctions package and slammed the security council . " today the enemies of the iranian people are seeking to use the security council to prevent the progress and development of iran .
but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions . " no military action the new un draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by the security council in december after tehran spurned repeated un demands to freeze uranium enrichment , a possible pathway to nuclear weapons .
those measures included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to the islamic republic and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been unimpressed by the pressure for it to halt its nuclear work the new draft , a copy of which was obtained by afp , would bar iran from exporting arms and would urge all states to restrict the sale or transfer " of any battle tanks , armored combat vehicles , large-caliber artillery systems , combat aircraft , attack helicopters , warships , missiles " and other arms . it calls for a voluntary travel ban on additional officials and companies involved in iran 's " proliferation sensitive " nuclear and ballistic missile programs .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .
in washington , the white house said us president george w. bush hoped for a vote " soon . "
confrontation programmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad news of the agreement set the stage for a dramatic confrontation with president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who formally asked to attend the council meeting when the sanctions come up for a vote . " he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- wants to come when the resolution is being adopted , " said south african ambassador dumisani kumalo , who chairs the council this month .
kumalo earlier said a vote could come next week .
ahmadinejad : " security council has no legitimacy " a defiant ahmadinejad , who insists tehran 's nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , earlier thursday dismissed the new sanctions package and slammed the security council . " today the enemies of the iranian people are seeking to use the security council to prevent the progress and development of iran .
but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions . " no military action the new un draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by the security council in december after tehran spurned repeated un demands to freeze uranium enrichment , a possible pathway to nuclear weapons .
those measures included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to the islamic republic and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been unimpressed by the pressure for it to halt its nuclear work the new draft , a copy of which was obtained by afp , would bar iran from exporting arms and would urge all states to restrict the sale or transfer " of any battle tanks , armored combat vehicles , large-caliber artillery systems , combat aircraft , attack helicopters , warships , missiles " and other arms . it calls for a voluntary travel ban on additional officials and companies involved in iran 's " proliferation sensitive " nuclear and ballistic missile programs .
it also urges voluntary restrictions on " new commitments for grants , financial assistance and loans to iran " as well as extending an assets freeze to additional entities and individuals linked to iran 's nuclear and missile programs . the text would give iran 60 days to comply with repeated un demands or face " further appropriate measures " -lrb- economic sanctions but no military action -rrb- under article 41 of the un charter . visiting french prime minister dominique de villepin told reporters here that tehran had a choice between accepting its " international obligations concerning enrichment " or sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shrugs off threat of more united nations sanctions iran has shrugged off the threat of additional un security council sanctions over its nuclear program .

" in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .
operators ignore issue earlier german economics minister michael glos , whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , said " the will to reach an accord on roaming was demonstrated " at the meeting .
" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .
" but in the process of dealing with the matter , competition among the operators and the incentives for innovation must not be endangered . " the ministers voiced their support for structuring the rules as simply as possible and keeping potential bureaucratic hurdles to a minimum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has been deaf to calls to give consumers a break thursday 's gathering was the last before a formal ministers ' meeting in brussels june 6 and 7 . the european parliament will vote in may on the issue , amid serious strain between telecommunications firms and the european commission . the commission , stating a goal of driving down roaming charges by 70 percent , put forward proposals in july for reducing the rates .
frustrated that operators had paid little heed to calls for lower roaming fees - a surcharge that the eu estimates brings in 8.5 billion euros each year - the commission suggested fixing the wholesale roaming rates that mobile phone companies charge each other . it also proposed to cap the retail rates that companies can impose , as well as the cost of calls received abroad .
merkel could win points with public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel could claim victory if vacationers can enjoy cheaper rates a final area that still requires a compromise is the cost of calls made locally with a foreign cell phone , for example if a german tourist calls a taxi in france .
the commission has proposed a maximum charge on such calls of 33 euro cents per minute . germany has set the target of getting a roaming deal under its eu presidency , running until the end of june , so holidaymakers can enjoy cheaper rates while abroad next summer . " that would be a great victory for the -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency of -lrb- chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , " reding said . dw staff 7 afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european mobile phone companies vow to ensure safe content european mobile phone operators and content providers have signed a new european union voluntary code of conduct to help protect children from harmful content .

" led by poland 's euro-sceptic identical twins , president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , warsaw last month urged the eu to ditch attempts to revive the constitution which was put on ice two years ago when french and dutch voters rejected it . " the time for reflection is past .
it 's time for decisions .
i pledge that there will be a roadmap to move forward -lrb- with the constitution -rrb- by the end of the german presidency , " in june , merkel said . " it is not only in europe 's interest but also in the interest of member states and citizens of europe that this process is taken to a positive end by the next european elections in 2009 . " failure to do this would be a historic missed opportunity , " merkel said . do n't dwell on , or forget , the past she urged poland to leave behind - but not forget - past tensions with germany and move forward with its central european neighbor for a stronger europe . " as pope john paul ii said , it is god 's will that germany and poland are neighbours .
as neighbors , we have a duty and responsibility to live well together , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been high between poland and germany lately " for germany and poland to live well together , today and in future , we must draw lessons from the darkest period in our history , " she said , referring to world war ii , during which " more than six million poles lost their lives because of the germans . " germans must not only accept their nation 's dark past but also be allowed to mourn it , merkel said . " as german chancellor , i understand and support the germans who at the end of world war ii were painfully forced from their homeland , and their right to look back on their fate with dignity , " she said in her speech in the polish capital , a city almost entirely destroyed by the nazis at the end of the war . expellees addressed gnawing at relations between poland and germany is the issue of germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history . " dignity would , to my mind , come from not just the germans who were expelled or fled , but also all others , including poles , being allowed to remember their pain and , above all , for it to be made clear that history can not and will not be rewritten , " merkel said . christian question europeans are united by common values , she said , but failed to go as far as the leaders of catholic poland who want references to christianity to be included in a statement set to be issued to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding treaty of rome next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is still very strong in poland " europe is not a ' christian club ' , as some would like to say .
but europe is founded on values that are clearly grounded in the christian vision of humanity , " said merkel . poles and germans must " keep working to make old fears , worries and even prejudices disappear , " but assured that " a lot of hard work has already been done , " the german chancellor said . " there is only one way forward : do n't act alone but as part of a united europe , which is also a strong europe . " merkel left warsaw after the speech for the polish presidential retreat in the baltic seaside resort of hel , where she is due to hold closed-door talks on saturday with the polish president . dw staff -lrb- afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.03.2007 eu hopes for summer deal on mobile phone roaming rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european vacationers could save money if the deal goes through eu telecoms ministers have reached broad agreement on trimming the high cost of using mobile phones abroad , raising hopes for a " roaming fees " deal to be sealed by the end of june . after an informal meeting on thursday on the sidelines of the world 's biggest high-tech fair , the cebit , european information and media commissioner viviane reding said the bloc would likely sign off on regulations in the first half of the year capping roaming charges at 50 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- per minute . " in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .
operators ignore issue earlier german economics minister michael glos , whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , said " the will to reach an accord on roaming was demonstrated " at the meeting .
" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .
" but in the process of dealing with the matter , competition among the operators and the incentives for innovation must not be endangered . " the ministers voiced their support for structuring the rules as simply as possible and keeping potential bureaucratic hurdles to a minimum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has been deaf to calls to give consumers a break thursday 's gathering was the last before a formal ministers ' meeting in brussels june 6 and 7 . the european parliament will vote in may on the issue , amid serious strain between telecommunications firms and the european commission . the commission , stating a goal of driving down roaming charges by 70 percent , put forward proposals in july for reducing the rates .
frustrated that operators had paid little heed to calls for lower roaming fees - a surcharge that the eu estimates brings in 8.5 billion euros each year - the commission suggested fixing the wholesale roaming rates that mobile phone companies charge each other . it also proposed to cap the retail rates that companies can impose , as well as the cost of calls received abroad .
merkel could win points with public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel could claim victory if vacationers can enjoy cheaper rates a final area that still requires a compromise is the cost of calls made locally with a foreign cell phone , for example if a german tourist calls a taxi in france .
the commission has proposed a maximum charge on such calls of 33 euro cents per minute . germany has set the target of getting a roaming deal under its eu presidency , running until the end of june , so holidaymakers can enjoy cheaper rates while abroad next summer . " that would be a great victory for the -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency of -lrb- chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , " reding said . dw staff 7 afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european mobile phone companies vow to ensure safe content european mobile phone operators and content providers have signed a new european union voluntary code of conduct to help protect children from harmful content .

" the results of the reconnaissance flights will be used directly to support the combat led by ground troops and fighter aircraft , " they said . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe on friday rejected their argument as " false . " opponents ' argument the same claim was made by political opponents of the tornado mission , which was approved by parliament last week with 405 votes to 157 . the german military has 2,750 soldiers in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , but has resisted pressure from nato allies to extend its mandate to the south where they would likely face combat against the taliban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some soliders in afghanistan are worried about " mission creep " raabe confirmed reports that an officer who organizes logistical support for german forces in afghanistan has filed an application asking to be relieved of these duties because he had misgivings about the tornado deployment . the soldier argues that the mission might contravene both the german constitution and international law . controversial the mission has sparked considerable controversy in germany . the nation remains wary of sending troops into combat six decades after the end of world war ii and a recent poll showed that 77 percent of germans did not want the tornados sent to afghanistan . two conservative mps launched a court application to stop the deployment but it was rejected . a group linked to al qaeda last sunday warned germany and austria that their presence in afghanistan has made the countries targets for militant attacks . another militant group said it would kill a german woman and her son being held hostage in iraq unless berlin began withdrawing its soldiers from afghanistan within 10 days . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects bid to block tornado mission in afghanistan germany 's constitutional court rejected a bid by two conservative representatives to block berlin 's deployment of tornado jets in afghanistan in support of nato 's offensive against the taliban .

missing the bus gave her a chance to practice zen-like mindfulness . the january opening of a church of scientology center in berlin has caused a stir of local concern about the “ brainwashing ” sect ’ s street-corner proselytizing .
meanwhile , the construction of a new mosque in pankow has riled up residents and right-wing politicians . yet alarmist fears and prejudiced indignation don ’ t interest me as much as another aspect of berlin ’ s religion-related happenings : the large buddhist community i have discovered here . the zen trend buddhism has become part of western leitkultur , from labeling a laid-back attitude as “ zen , ” as in , “ i wish i could be a little more zen about my work , ” to the smiling , seated buddha statuettes sold as trendy centerpieces , to richard gere ’ s “ free tibet ” campaigns with the dalai lama .
from slang to home furnishings to hollywood , buddhism pops up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin cathedral represents a different kind of religious tradition i didn ’ t come to germany to discover what lies beneath this superficial web of associations ; rather , the interest arose when i got here , causing me to wonder whether berlin was the right place to learn more .
the enormous , friendly , group of individuals i have since met has definitively proven that , although germans are allegedly less religious than ever , many have discovered a sort of non-dogma they can live by . in contrast to christianity and judaism , the two religions with the historically largest followings in germany , buddhism isn ’ t necessarily a faith-based system . it has a tradition of teachers who exhort their listeners to “ try it out ” before agreeing , and many major principles sound more like common sense than mysticism , which may be part of its appeal in europe ’ s “ god is dead ” era .
for example , the ideal of mindfulness , for which many adherents strive , simply describes the state of being fully present in the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagogue in berlin a recent magazine article about fun diversions for berliners suggested dabbling in mindfulness , only to conclude that being aware of your surroundings and the nice altbau architecture on the bike ride home was less efficient than mentally planning dinner . yet mindfulness isn ’ t about inefficiency - it ’ s about the power of non-fragmented attention to wake up to the surroundings . respond " mindfully " can be rewarding one morning , having forgotten as i usually do to turn off the heat in my apartment - not something i ’ m used to from growing up with building-wide controlled heating in new york - i ran back in to turn the knob and missed the impeccably punctual bus by about ten seconds . i began fuming , but instead of going with it , i tried to be mindful , taking a deep breath and thinking , “ hello , fuming .
what else is there in this minute alongside you ? ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell did n't have to worry about turning off the heating in new york city to al gore ’ s probable horror , i noticed it was an unseasonably warm and beautiful day . missing the bus was a great chance to walk to the next stop and enjoy the weather .
in other words , i paid a little attention to what was going on parallel to my own bundle of nerves and felt rewarded . mindfulness isn ’ t going to turn me into a completely “ zen ” individual any time soon , especially since living abroad seems to be a continual adaptation process , not one that eventually slows .
but by increasing self-awareness , it is a useful tool for better responding to the occasional frustration of living as a foreigner , such as not remembering how to express certain ideas in german or suffering through the lines at the ausländerbehörde -lrb- public office for foreigners -rrb- . now if i could just figure out how to respond mindfully to those scientology solicitors accosting passers-by outside of kadewe … arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns memory , one piece at a time after literally stumbling over a holocaust memorial in berlin , arden pennell investigated the history of berlin 's " stumbling stones .

for example , the ideal of mindfulness , for which many adherents strive , simply describes the state of being fully present in the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagogue in berlin a recent magazine article about fun diversions for berliners suggested dabbling in mindfulness , only to conclude that being aware of your surroundings and the nice altbau architecture on the bike ride home was less efficient than mentally planning dinner . yet mindfulness isn ’ t about inefficiency - it ’ s about the power of non-fragmented attention to wake up to the surroundings . respond " mindfully " can be rewarding one morning , having forgotten as i usually do to turn off the heat in my apartment - not something i ’ m used to from growing up with building-wide controlled heating in new york - i ran back in to turn the knob and missed the impeccably punctual bus by about ten seconds . i began fuming , but instead of going with it , i tried to be mindful , taking a deep breath and thinking , “ hello , fuming .
what else is there in this minute alongside you ? ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell did n't have to worry about turning off the heating in new york city to al gore ’ s probable horror , i noticed it was an unseasonably warm and beautiful day . missing the bus was a great chance to walk to the next stop and enjoy the weather .
in other words , i paid a little attention to what was going on parallel to my own bundle of nerves and felt rewarded . mindfulness isn ’ t going to turn me into a completely “ zen ” individual any time soon , especially since living abroad seems to be a continual adaptation process , not one that eventually slows .
but by increasing self-awareness , it is a useful tool for better responding to the occasional frustration of living as a foreigner , such as not remembering how to express certain ideas in german or suffering through the lines at the ausländerbehörde -lrb- public office for foreigners -rrb- . now if i could just figure out how to respond mindfully to those scientology solicitors accosting passers-by outside of kadewe … arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns memory , one piece at a time after literally stumbling over a holocaust memorial in berlin , arden pennell investigated the history of berlin 's " stumbling stones .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .
in washington , the white house said us president george w. bush hoped for a vote " soon . "
confrontation programmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad news of the agreement set the stage for a dramatic confrontation with president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who formally asked to attend the council meeting when the sanctions come up for a vote . " he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- wants to come when the resolution is being adopted , " said south african ambassador dumisani kumalo , who chairs the council this month .
kumalo earlier said a vote could come next week .
ahmadinejad : " security council has no legitimacy " a defiant ahmadinejad , who insists tehran 's nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , earlier thursday dismissed the new sanctions package and slammed the security council . " today the enemies of the iranian people are seeking to use the security council to prevent the progress and development of iran .
but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions . " no military action the new un draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by the security council in december after tehran spurned repeated un demands to freeze uranium enrichment , a possible pathway to nuclear weapons .
those measures included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to the islamic republic and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been unimpressed by the pressure for it to halt its nuclear work the new draft , a copy of which was obtained by afp , would bar iran from exporting arms and would urge all states to restrict the sale or transfer " of any battle tanks , armored combat vehicles , large-caliber artillery systems , combat aircraft , attack helicopters , warships , missiles " and other arms . it calls for a voluntary travel ban on additional officials and companies involved in iran 's " proliferation sensitive " nuclear and ballistic missile programs .
it also urges voluntary restrictions on " new commitments for grants , financial assistance and loans to iran " as well as extending an assets freeze to additional entities and individuals linked to iran 's nuclear and missile programs . the text would give iran 60 days to comply with repeated un demands or face " further appropriate measures " -lrb- economic sanctions but no military action -rrb- under article 41 of the un charter . visiting french prime minister dominique de villepin told reporters here that tehran had a choice between accepting its " international obligations concerning enrichment " or sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shrugs off threat of more united nations sanctions iran has shrugged off the threat of additional un security council sanctions over its nuclear program .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .
in washington , the white house said us president george w. bush hoped for a vote " soon . "
confrontation programmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad news of the agreement set the stage for a dramatic confrontation with president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who formally asked to attend the council meeting when the sanctions come up for a vote . " he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- wants to come when the resolution is being adopted , " said south african ambassador dumisani kumalo , who chairs the council this month .
kumalo earlier said a vote could come next week .
ahmadinejad : " security council has no legitimacy " a defiant ahmadinejad , who insists tehran 's nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , earlier thursday dismissed the new sanctions package and slammed the security council . " today the enemies of the iranian people are seeking to use the security council to prevent the progress and development of iran .
but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions . " no military action the new un draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by the security council in december after tehran spurned repeated un demands to freeze uranium enrichment , a possible pathway to nuclear weapons .
those measures included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to the islamic republic and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been unimpressed by the pressure for it to halt its nuclear work the new draft , a copy of which was obtained by afp , would bar iran from exporting arms and would urge all states to restrict the sale or transfer " of any battle tanks , armored combat vehicles , large-caliber artillery systems , combat aircraft , attack helicopters , warships , missiles " and other arms . it calls for a voluntary travel ban on additional officials and companies involved in iran 's " proliferation sensitive " nuclear and ballistic missile programs .
it also urges voluntary restrictions on " new commitments for grants , financial assistance and loans to iran " as well as extending an assets freeze to additional entities and individuals linked to iran 's nuclear and missile programs . the text would give iran 60 days to comply with repeated un demands or face " further appropriate measures " -lrb- economic sanctions but no military action -rrb- under article 41 of the un charter . visiting french prime minister dominique de villepin told reporters here that tehran had a choice between accepting its " international obligations concerning enrichment " or sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shrugs off threat of more united nations sanctions iran has shrugged off the threat of additional un security council sanctions over its nuclear program .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .

he had on the " so now " 80s get up , mixed with a touch of heroin chic : scruffy converse all-stars , skintight navy blue jeans , a white shirt and black tie , nicely complimented by his greasy hair , which hung sweatily in his eyes , and of course the obligatory cigarette dangling from his mouth . people weren ’ t dancing initially , which was either because they were too cool , or perhaps because the music was a bit clunky and not easy to dance to unless you had robotic limbs .
however , when the second band did an electro cover of sinead o ’ connor ’ s 80s classic “ nothing compares 2 u , ” the crowd went wild , singing along and swaying happily .
total 80 ’ s overload . saved from the dumpster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does 80s fashion belong here ?
i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .
or being completely in awe of kylie , in her days of frizzy perms and high-waist , drainpipe jeans . bildunterschrift : faith dennis now owns robin hood boots to us , 80s clothes are like the " blankies " of our twenties , familiar and comforting . faith gives in to " the blankie " that ’ s not to say there hasn ’ t been a resistance , just like the advent of mobile phones which had us divided into two camps in the 90 ’ s ; those who thought they were just for show-offs , and those who liked showing off with them . i was in the former camp for a long time , until one day i buckled and joined the " other side . "
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .
oh dear . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith dennis ' earlier columns manpower - the only way to the top ?
women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.03.2007 french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's new tgv 's will lead the new push to modernize europe 's railways france cut the ribbon thursday on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour . transport minister dominique perben , traveling with dozens of french business leaders and guests , made the inaugural eastbound journey from paris thursday on board the new tgv-est , ahead of a lavish evening ceremony . some 3,000 torches were due to light up in a wave along the entire 300 kilometers of the rail line in a spectacular pyrotechnic show broadcast on national television . pride of french engineering , the train à grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- - which turned 25 last year - is one of the world 's fastest rail services , along with japan 's shinkansen bullet train connecting tokyo , nagoya , kyoto and osaka and germany 's ice -lrb- inter-city express -rrb- . the new tgv service is the latest attempt by european railway companies to counter the popularity of budget airlines which charge a fraction of the cost of rail tickets to the same destinations .
by providing faster services , coupled with rising concern over the environmental impact of no-frills air travel , railway operators hope that customers will return to train travel . deutsche bahn 's european hub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new central station is seen as europe 's new hub deutsche bahn , the german railways operator , hope that its state-of-the-art new main station in berlin will act as a european hub for rail travel , and change the minds of those travelers who consider budget flights as their best option for reaching european cities .
in brussels , a modernization of the midi station into a true international hub serving the eurostar , tgv , thalys and ice services hope to have the same effect in the capital of the eu . the eu itself has come up with initiatives to open the rail market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems across the continent in line with each other on all major tracks in an attempt to increase efficiency and choice . european countries have been waking up to the need for bigger and better train systems for a number of years .
work began five years ago on the state-of-the-art paris-strasbourg tgv line , which opens to the public on june 10 .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

he had on the " so now " 80s get up , mixed with a touch of heroin chic : scruffy converse all-stars , skintight navy blue jeans , a white shirt and black tie , nicely complimented by his greasy hair , which hung sweatily in his eyes , and of course the obligatory cigarette dangling from his mouth . people weren ’ t dancing initially , which was either because they were too cool , or perhaps because the music was a bit clunky and not easy to dance to unless you had robotic limbs .
however , when the second band did an electro cover of sinead o ’ connor ’ s 80s classic “ nothing compares 2 u , ” the crowd went wild , singing along and swaying happily .
total 80 ’ s overload . saved from the dumpster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does 80s fashion belong here ?
i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .
or being completely in awe of kylie , in her days of frizzy perms and high-waist , drainpipe jeans . bildunterschrift : faith dennis now owns robin hood boots to us , 80s clothes are like the " blankies " of our twenties , familiar and comforting . faith gives in to " the blankie " that ’ s not to say there hasn ’ t been a resistance , just like the advent of mobile phones which had us divided into two camps in the 90 ’ s ; those who thought they were just for show-offs , and those who liked showing off with them . i was in the former camp for a long time , until one day i buckled and joined the " other side . "
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .

" led by poland 's euro-sceptic identical twins , president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , warsaw last month urged the eu to ditch attempts to revive the constitution which was put on ice two years ago when french and dutch voters rejected it . " the time for reflection is past .
it 's time for decisions .
i pledge that there will be a roadmap to move forward -lrb- with the constitution -rrb- by the end of the german presidency , " in june , merkel said . " it is not only in europe 's interest but also in the interest of member states and citizens of europe that this process is taken to a positive end by the next european elections in 2009 . " failure to do this would be a historic missed opportunity , " merkel said . do n't dwell on , or forget , the past she urged poland to leave behind - but not forget - past tensions with germany and move forward with its central european neighbor for a stronger europe . " as pope john paul ii said , it is god 's will that germany and poland are neighbours .
as neighbors , we have a duty and responsibility to live well together , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been high between poland and germany lately " for germany and poland to live well together , today and in future , we must draw lessons from the darkest period in our history , " she said , referring to world war ii , during which " more than six million poles lost their lives because of the germans . " germans must not only accept their nation 's dark past but also be allowed to mourn it , merkel said . " as german chancellor , i understand and support the germans who at the end of world war ii were painfully forced from their homeland , and their right to look back on their fate with dignity , " she said in her speech in the polish capital , a city almost entirely destroyed by the nazis at the end of the war . expellees addressed gnawing at relations between poland and germany is the issue of germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history . " dignity would , to my mind , come from not just the germans who were expelled or fled , but also all others , including poles , being allowed to remember their pain and , above all , for it to be made clear that history can not and will not be rewritten , " merkel said . christian question europeans are united by common values , she said , but failed to go as far as the leaders of catholic poland who want references to christianity to be included in a statement set to be issued to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding treaty of rome next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is still very strong in poland " europe is not a ' christian club ' , as some would like to say .
but europe is founded on values that are clearly grounded in the christian vision of humanity , " said merkel . poles and germans must " keep working to make old fears , worries and even prejudices disappear , " but assured that " a lot of hard work has already been done , " the german chancellor said . " there is only one way forward : do n't act alone but as part of a united europe , which is also a strong europe .

" in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .
operators ignore issue earlier german economics minister michael glos , whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , said " the will to reach an accord on roaming was demonstrated " at the meeting .
" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .
" but in the process of dealing with the matter , competition among the operators and the incentives for innovation must not be endangered . " the ministers voiced their support for structuring the rules as simply as possible and keeping potential bureaucratic hurdles to a minimum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has been deaf to calls to give consumers a break thursday 's gathering was the last before a formal ministers ' meeting in brussels june 6 and 7 . the european parliament will vote in may on the issue , amid serious strain between telecommunications firms and the european commission . the commission , stating a goal of driving down roaming charges by 70 percent , put forward proposals in july for reducing the rates .
frustrated that operators had paid little heed to calls for lower roaming fees - a surcharge that the eu estimates brings in 8.5 billion euros each year - the commission suggested fixing the wholesale roaming rates that mobile phone companies charge each other . it also proposed to cap the retail rates that companies can impose , as well as the cost of calls received abroad .
merkel could win points with public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel could claim victory if vacationers can enjoy cheaper rates a final area that still requires a compromise is the cost of calls made locally with a foreign cell phone , for example if a german tourist calls a taxi in france .
the commission has proposed a maximum charge on such calls of 33 euro cents per minute . germany has set the target of getting a roaming deal under its eu presidency , running until the end of june , so holidaymakers can enjoy cheaper rates while abroad next summer .

"
kaczynski and merkel brace for the next row german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst . the smiles will be diplomatic and the handshakes firm , but there is likely to be no love lost between angela merkel and the kaczynski twins when the german chancellor arrives in poland for a two-day visit on friday . while it is widely assumed that relations between germany and poland are at an all time low , experts in german-polish affairs say that the atmosphere between the two nations has in fact rarely been better since 1989 .
however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

however , continuing diplomatic spats have added to the impression of two countries with a simmering animosity for each other . the latest incident , arising from comments made on wednesday by the polish official employed to improve bilateral ties , is likely to make merkel 's meeting with president lech kaczynski and his brother jaroslaw , the prime minister , in warsaw even more strained . as merkel was preparing to leave for poland , mariusz muszynski , the new representative for polish-german relations , accused germany of egotism , selfishness and of having any knowledge of his country which he described as " a victim of war and aggression . " in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper , muszynski criticized germany of looking after its own national interests instead of working to resolve areas of conflict with poland .
he added that poland could not be blamed for its own unfriendly posture towards germany when the germans were so unwilling to cooperate . so why do the germans and poles continue to snipe at each other ?
there are , of course , still many important issues to resolve from their long and painful shared history , but in a contemporary context , many of the arguments seem petty . germany and poland suffering a crisis of trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of mutual trust and understanding causes problems " the two countries are suffering a mutual trust crisis , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs told dw-world.de.
" germany was poland 's most important ally during the 90s , when poland achieved its main goals of eu-nato membership .
now there is the question of what happens next , what are the common challenges and projects .
there is also the problem of lack of mutual knowledge between the countries which has led to misunderstandings . " " the germans are just fed up of being the paymasters of europe , " ann kennard , an expert in german-polish relations at the university of west england , said .
" they have been the most single-minded of the large european states in trying to achieve meaningful european integration , and now that poland is a member , they probably feel they do n't have to have quite such a ' kid-gloves ' approach . " from an outside perspective , it must look as if germany and poland are intent on fuelling the fires of animosity between them whenever possible and taking every opportunity to scupper potential breakthroughs when an opportunity for negotiation arises .
but kennard believes neither side has anything to gain by prolonging this current period of antagonism . few benefits from continued animosity " i do not see any benefits from keeping these animosities going , in fact , it 's quite the opposite , " she said .
" as the largest of the most recent members to join the eu , poland feels it can be open and outspoken , but there is no future in antagonizing its closest neighbor and biggest trade partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was poland 's biggest eu supporter " equally , germany has nothing to gain from allowing expellee groups to make the headlines on property issues so many years after treaties were signed accepting the postwar borders between them " while there may not be anything either country can gain from prolonging the disputes that separate them , new problems continually arise .
while the poles have become adept at making inflammatory statements when the germans appear at their most conciliatory , germany has timed policy changes and gestures to create maximum embarrassment and outrage in poland . responsibility , not blame , the issue " when it comes to the issue of a strained relationship , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , " there is seldom just one side to blame .
therefore it is a wrong impression in germany right now that it is all about the crazy twins in warsaw .
-lrb- former chancellor -rrb- schröder 's flirtation with the traditional paris-berlin-moscow power axis left poland in the cold and his dealings in the baltic oil pipeline did n't help .
and the project to commemorate the fate of about 12 million expelled germans after world war ii certainly irritated poland . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 60 years of expulsion " did n't go down well in poland " this , however , does n't change the fact that the polish government holds the largest part of the responsibility for the actual mess we are facing at the moment , " bastos added .
" the twins based their election campaigns on anti-german resentments and insecurities towards germany and they keep on using bilateral issues in general and historical questions in particular for domestic goals .
in fact , they do n't have a european or foreign policy agenda .
foreign policy is just one tool for domestic power games .
but there are small signs of some learning processes in warsaw . " so is there hope that one day germany and poland can resolve their differences and stop the pendulum of animosity swinging between them ? european cooperation can help heal wounds " in my view , relations between the two countries since 1989 have been exemplary and , until recently , they have both looked forward and have taken a practical and pragmatic view of their future together in the new europe , " ann kennard said .
" it is actually quite surprising that relations have been as good as they have , one would have expected a much more problematic and difficult relationship considering their shared history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pain for domestic gain ?
the brothers kaczynski " it also needs to be emphasized that relations in the population at large , business and cultural contacts , etc. are generally fine , and should not be obscured by high profile squabbles between the two governments .
i believe something has to give sooner rather than later and i hope it will . " kai-olaf lang believes that cooperation on european agendas can help heal the wounds .
" mistrust can be diminished by closer collaboration , " he said .
" by utilizing both countries ' expertise in the european challenges we currently face , both nations can display their worth both separately and together , for their own benefit and europe 's .
there just needs more understanding in germany about polish motivations and fears and more openness and pragmatism from poland .

he had on the " so now " 80s get up , mixed with a touch of heroin chic : scruffy converse all-stars , skintight navy blue jeans , a white shirt and black tie , nicely complimented by his greasy hair , which hung sweatily in his eyes , and of course the obligatory cigarette dangling from his mouth . people weren ’ t dancing initially , which was either because they were too cool , or perhaps because the music was a bit clunky and not easy to dance to unless you had robotic limbs .
however , when the second band did an electro cover of sinead o ’ connor ’ s 80s classic “ nothing compares 2 u , ” the crowd went wild , singing along and swaying happily .
total 80 ’ s overload . saved from the dumpster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does 80s fashion belong here ?
i couldn ’ t help thinking “ what is wrong with us all ? ” there we were , a crowd full of skinny jeans tucked into pointy boots , t-shirts with bat wings and leggings wearing 20-somethings reliving a decade of fashion which should have been packed into bin liners along with our " blankies " and baby clothes and bid farewell outside a charity shop -lrb- or flea market -rrb- on january 1 , 1990 . for years we all laughed heartily at the pictures of our parents sporting the very clothes that have slowly but surely been creeping back into our wardrobes , one by one , over the last few seasons .
and quite rightly so - the 80s were a dire decade for fashion and just because a few supermodels have strutted down the catwalk wearing pointy ankle boots and shoulder pads doesn ’ t mean we all have to take on the fad . or does it ? fashion nostalgia i have a theory that , for the generation of 80s children , the decade ’ s fashion revival reminds us of our childhood and that ’ s why we have embraced every last legwarmer and stripy top . looking back down memory lane with our rose-tinted glasses , we remember dancing to depeche mode or cindy lauper with bfg ’ s , -lrb- big friendly grown-ups -rrb- , at our parents ’ parties .
or being completely in awe of kylie , in her days of frizzy perms and high-waist , drainpipe jeans . bildunterschrift : faith dennis now owns robin hood boots to us , 80s clothes are like the " blankies " of our twenties , familiar and comforting . faith gives in to " the blankie " that ’ s not to say there hasn ’ t been a resistance , just like the advent of mobile phones which had us divided into two camps in the 90 ’ s ; those who thought they were just for show-offs , and those who liked showing off with them . i was in the former camp for a long time , until one day i buckled and joined the " other side . "
the 80s revival has presented a similar dilemma for me , since having arrived in berlin . although i haven ’ t yet acquired a short fringe and a pair of leggings , i have to admit that despite my protesting , i have finally given in and can now be seen wandering the streets of kreuzberg sporting robin hood boots and almost skinny jeans .

" in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .

" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .

frustrated that operators had paid little heed to calls for lower roaming fees - a surcharge that the eu estimates brings in 8.5 billion euros each year - the commission suggested fixing the wholesale roaming rates that mobile phone companies charge each other . it also proposed to cap the retail rates that companies can impose , as well as the cost of calls received abroad .

the commission has proposed a maximum charge on such calls of 33 euro cents per minute . germany has set the target of getting a roaming deal under its eu presidency , running until the end of june , so holidaymakers can enjoy cheaper rates while abroad next summer .

" in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .
operators ignore issue earlier german economics minister michael glos , whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , said " the will to reach an accord on roaming was demonstrated " at the meeting .
" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .

" we have shown today that workers at the european level are speaking with a single voice , " declared peter scherrer , head of the european metalworking federation , speaking in paris outside the headquarters of airbus parent company eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday demonstration in blagnac near toulouse , southwestern france in hamburg in germany , 42-year-old johannes budde , who has worked for airbus for 18 years , said worker solidarity was the key to forcing management to scrap the overhaul , dubbed power8 . " it 's only in standing shoulder to shoulder that we will be able to demonstrate our strength to management , " he said , noting in anger that airbus wanted to slash jobs at a time when its books were healthy . " despite our success , they 're cutting jobs .
but this demonstration sends a good signal to management - they have to understand that without us they ca n't work . " organizers said 25,000 people turned out for demonstrations in hamburg and elsewhere in germany , 7,000 in toulouse , where airbus is headquartered , 4,000 at three other sites in france and 9,000 at seven spanish locations . police estimated the gathering at 10,000 in hamburg and 5,500 in toulouse . airbus : cuts are needed airbus insists that its financial and production difficulties are " extremely serious " and that it can no longer delay making cost savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human chain surrounds the airbus site at laupheim the cuts , together with the total or partial disposal of six sites , are intended to save 5.0 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and pull the company out of a crisis caused by delays to its a380 superjumbo program , seen as critical to airbus ' bid to catch up with us rival boeing . the job losses will target airbus production sites in france , germany , spain and britain .
management has also blamed the strong euro , which makes its products less competitive on world markets and reduces the value of its dollar-based sales , on the manufacturer 's financial woes . eads , the european aeronautic defence and space company , last week published results revealing a first-ever operating loss at its airbus unit of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2005 . franco-german tensions announcement of the restructuring on february 28 came amid tension between french and german interests , which dominate eads , over where cuts should fall . in the german state of lower saxony where airbus has two sites , regional premier christian wulff voiced support friday for the workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 superjumbo taxies on the tarmac in france but in remarks pointing to underlying tensions between german and french interests over the plan , hamburg senator gunnar uldall complained that as french politicians and unions had " turned airbus into a national project , we have to do the same . " daniel friedrich , a spokesman for the powerful german union ig metall , said support from the german federal government would be necessary to force airbus bosses to rescind power8 . he added that it was now up to airbus management to unveil the finer points in the plan , after which " we will be able to propose better solutions , which will takes weeks or months . " good news airbus on thursday received a much needed boost to its business and credibility when two customers pledged new orders worth 23 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- . qatar airways said it planned to buy 80 a350 jets for $ 17.2 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices , one of the biggest orders in the history of airbus , and russian airline aeroflot said it would sign a deal for 22 more of the same aircraft . the contracts would be a huge win for the mid-sized , long-haul a350 plane , which was withdrawn and relaunched by airbus as the a350xwb last year because of poor feedback on the original version from potential customers . eads shares closed higher friday , gaining 1.38 percent to reach 22.05 euros on the paris exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus workers across europe to down tools friday tens of thousands of airbus workers are expected to walk off the job on friday in an unusual europe-wide labor action against plans by the struggling aircraft manufacturer to slash 10,000 posts in four countries .

by providing faster services , coupled with rising concern over the environmental impact of no-frills air travel , railway operators hope that customers will return to train travel . deutsche bahn 's european hub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new central station is seen as europe 's new hub deutsche bahn , the german railways operator , hope that its state-of-the-art new main station in berlin will act as a european hub for rail travel , and change the minds of those travelers who consider budget flights as their best option for reaching european cities .
in brussels , a modernization of the midi station into a true international hub serving the eurostar , tgv , thalys and ice services hope to have the same effect in the capital of the eu . the eu itself has come up with initiatives to open the rail market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems across the continent in line with each other on all major tracks in an attempt to increase efficiency and choice . european countries have been waking up to the need for bigger and better train systems for a number of years .

one of the biggest rail projects in europe , it mobilized some 10,000 workers and required 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers . last month , it was on the paris-strasbourg line that the tgv broke its own world record by hitting a peak speed of 553 kilometers per hour during a test run .
it is to attempt a new high-velocity breakthrough in the coming weeks . new fast trains countering airline popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tgvs will cut journey times dramatically the new train will cut the paris-strasbourg trip to two hours and 20 minutes from the current four hours .
it will also slash travel time to points further east , making the trip from paris to luxembourg in about two hours , to frankfurt in less than four and to munich in six hours and fifteen minutes . " some 37 million europeans can be reached , " said tgv-est director alain le guellec .
" a network of high-speed links is being put into place with the rest of europe . " president jacques chirac thursday hailed the new rail service as a " major industry success , " saying it would generate economic growth and jobs . " this admirably demonstrates france 's capabilities in research , development and innovation , " chirac said , lauding trains as faster , cheaper and greener than planes . perben announced on monday that the second phase of construction - which will knock another half-hour off the journey time from paris to strasbourg , to one hour 50 minutes - would be brought forward from 2010 to 2008 . but there are doubts over whether the rail service will be commercially viable . the project cost of four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- is being shared among 22 financial partners at various levels of the french government , as well as luxembourg , the european union and the french state-owned railway sncf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees to partly privatize railway system germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to partly privatize the country 's federal rail system by 2009 , government officials announced on wednesday in berlin after months of wrangling .

" germans must not only accept their nation 's dark past but also be allowed to mourn it , merkel said . " as german chancellor , i understand and support the germans who at the end of world war ii were painfully forced from their homeland , and their right to look back on their fate with dignity , " she said in her speech in the polish capital , a city almost entirely destroyed by the nazis at the end of the war . expellees addressed gnawing at relations between poland and germany is the issue of germans who were expelled from polish territory as world war ii drew to a close . they were among some 14 million german civilians who were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . merkel has in the past spoken out in favor of a proposed center for germany 's war displaced - a project that the kaczynski twins bitterly oppose , saying it is an attempt to portray germans as war victims and rewrite history .

" in order to arrive there it will be very intense work , " she said . reding did not mention a possible maximum charge for calls received when cell phone users are traveling outside their home country , but her spokesman provided the figure of 25 euro cents per minute . both prices given would be before the value-added tax levied by member states .
operators ignore issue earlier german economics minister michael glos , whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , said " the will to reach an accord on roaming was demonstrated " at the meeting .
" we can not count on the market to regulate it - that is over , " he said .
" but in the process of dealing with the matter , competition among the operators and the incentives for innovation must not be endangered . " the ministers voiced their support for structuring the rules as simply as possible and keeping potential bureaucratic hurdles to a minimum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has been deaf to calls to give consumers a break thursday 's gathering was the last before a formal ministers ' meeting in brussels june 6 and 7 . the european parliament will vote in may on the issue , amid serious strain between telecommunications firms and the european commission . the commission , stating a goal of driving down roaming charges by 70 percent , put forward proposals in july for reducing the rates .
frustrated that operators had paid little heed to calls for lower roaming fees - a surcharge that the eu estimates brings in 8.5 billion euros each year - the commission suggested fixing the wholesale roaming rates that mobile phone companies charge each other . it also proposed to cap the retail rates that companies can impose , as well as the cost of calls received abroad .
merkel could win points with public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel could claim victory if vacationers can enjoy cheaper rates a final area that still requires a compromise is the cost of calls made locally with a foreign cell phone , for example if a german tourist calls a taxi in france .
the commission has proposed a maximum charge on such calls of 33 euro cents per minute . germany has set the target of getting a roaming deal under its eu presidency , running until the end of june , so holidaymakers can enjoy cheaper rates while abroad next summer . " that would be a great victory for the -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency of -lrb- chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , " reding said . dw staff 7 afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european mobile phone companies vow to ensure safe content european mobile phone operators and content providers have signed a new european union voluntary code of conduct to help protect children from harmful content .

by providing faster services , coupled with rising concern over the environmental impact of no-frills air travel , railway operators hope that customers will return to train travel . deutsche bahn 's european hub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new central station is seen as europe 's new hub deutsche bahn , the german railways operator , hope that its state-of-the-art new main station in berlin will act as a european hub for rail travel , and change the minds of those travelers who consider budget flights as their best option for reaching european cities .
in brussels , a modernization of the midi station into a true international hub serving the eurostar , tgv , thalys and ice services hope to have the same effect in the capital of the eu . the eu itself has come up with initiatives to open the rail market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems across the continent in line with each other on all major tracks in an attempt to increase efficiency and choice . european countries have been waking up to the need for bigger and better train systems for a number of years .
work began five years ago on the state-of-the-art paris-strasbourg tgv line , which opens to the public on june 10 .
one of the biggest rail projects in europe , it mobilized some 10,000 workers and required 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers . last month , it was on the paris-strasbourg line that the tgv broke its own world record by hitting a peak speed of 553 kilometers per hour during a test run .
it is to attempt a new high-velocity breakthrough in the coming weeks . new fast trains countering airline popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tgvs will cut journey times dramatically the new train will cut the paris-strasbourg trip to two hours and 20 minutes from the current four hours .
it will also slash travel time to points further east , making the trip from paris to luxembourg in about two hours , to frankfurt in less than four and to munich in six hours and fifteen minutes . " some 37 million europeans can be reached , " said tgv-est director alain le guellec .
" a network of high-speed links is being put into place with the rest of europe . " president jacques chirac thursday hailed the new rail service as a " major industry success , " saying it would generate economic growth and jobs . " this admirably demonstrates france 's capabilities in research , development and innovation , " chirac said , lauding trains as faster , cheaper and greener than planes . perben announced on monday that the second phase of construction - which will knock another half-hour off the journey time from paris to strasbourg , to one hour 50 minutes - would be brought forward from 2010 to 2008 . but there are doubts over whether the rail service will be commercially viable . the project cost of four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- is being shared among 22 financial partners at various levels of the french government , as well as luxembourg , the european union and the french state-owned railway sncf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees to partly privatize railway system germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to partly privatize the country 's federal rail system by 2009 , government officials announced on wednesday in berlin after months of wrangling .

the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week .

a dramatic confrontation was expected as iran 's president asked to attend a security council vote . un ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on thursday on a new sanctions resolution that was submitted to the security council 's 10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week .
the compromise text emerged after 10 days of hard-nosed bargaining by the council 's five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . " yes , we have an agreement , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters after a final round of talks on how to rein in iran 's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . the agreement virtually ensures that measures to broaden existing sanctions and impose some new ones will be approved by the 15-member council when the draft is put to a vote , likely next week . " it 's a good , balanced , incremental step , " us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said .
in washington , the white house said us president george w. bush hoped for a vote " soon . "
confrontation programmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad news of the agreement set the stage for a dramatic confrontation with president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who formally asked to attend the council meeting when the sanctions come up for a vote . " he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- wants to come when the resolution is being adopted , " said south african ambassador dumisani kumalo , who chairs the council this month .
kumalo earlier said a vote could come next week .
ahmadinejad : " security council has no legitimacy " a defiant ahmadinejad , who insists tehran 's nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , earlier thursday dismissed the new sanctions package and slammed the security council . " today the enemies of the iranian people are seeking to use the security council to prevent the progress and development of iran .
but the security council has no legitimacy among the peoples of the world , " he said in a speech in the central yazd province . ahmadinejad 's defiance was echoed - albeit in a more measured way - by the foreign policy adviser of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said iran would continue its nuclear drive and played down the effect of more sanctions . ali akbar velayati , a highly influential former foreign minister , said iran would not " repeat the experience of suspending its uranium enrichment activities as the united states would not be satisfied by this and would then bring up other questions . " no military action the new un draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by the security council in december after tehran spurned repeated un demands to freeze uranium enrichment , a possible pathway to nuclear weapons .
those measures included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to the islamic republic and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work .

" opponents ' argument the same claim was made by political opponents of the tornado mission , which was approved by parliament last week with 405 votes to 157 . the german military has 2,750 soldiers in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , but has resisted pressure from nato allies to extend its mandate to the south where they would likely face combat against the taliban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some soliders in afghanistan are worried about " mission creep " raabe confirmed reports that an officer who organizes logistical support for german forces in afghanistan has filed an application asking to be relieved of these duties because he had misgivings about the tornado deployment . the soldier argues that the mission might contravene both the german constitution and international law . controversial the mission has sparked considerable controversy in germany . the nation remains wary of sending troops into combat six decades after the end of world war ii and a recent poll showed that 77 percent of germans did not want the tornados sent to afghanistan . two conservative mps launched a court application to stop the deployment but it was rejected . a group linked to al qaeda last sunday warned germany and austria that their presence in afghanistan has made the countries targets for militant attacks . another militant group said it would kill a german woman and her son being held hostage in iraq unless berlin began withdrawing its soldiers from afghanistan within 10 days . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects bid to block tornado mission in afghanistan germany 's constitutional court rejected a bid by two conservative representatives to block berlin 's deployment of tornado jets in afghanistan in support of nato 's offensive against the taliban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.03.2007 the " zen " of berlin : concentration and culture-shock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell discovered a bit of zen in berlin arden pennell has discovered that buddhist teachings are catching on in berlin .
missing the bus gave her a chance to practice zen-like mindfulness . the january opening of a church of scientology center in berlin has caused a stir of local concern about the “ brainwashing ” sect ’ s street-corner proselytizing .
meanwhile , the construction of a new mosque in pankow has riled up residents and right-wing politicians . yet alarmist fears and prejudiced indignation don ’ t interest me as much as another aspect of berlin ’ s religion-related happenings : the large buddhist community i have discovered here . the zen trend buddhism has become part of western leitkultur , from labeling a laid-back attitude as “ zen , ” as in , “ i wish i could be a little more zen about my work , ” to the smiling , seated buddha statuettes sold as trendy centerpieces , to richard gere ’ s “ free tibet ” campaigns with the dalai lama .
from slang to home furnishings to hollywood , buddhism pops up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin cathedral represents a different kind of religious tradition i didn ’ t come to germany to discover what lies beneath this superficial web of associations ; rather , the interest arose when i got here , causing me to wonder whether berlin was the right place to learn more .
the enormous , friendly , group of individuals i have since met has definitively proven that , although germans are allegedly less religious than ever , many have discovered a sort of non-dogma they can live by . in contrast to christianity and judaism , the two religions with the historically largest followings in germany , buddhism isn ’ t necessarily a faith-based system . it has a tradition of teachers who exhort their listeners to “ try it out ” before agreeing , and many major principles sound more like common sense than mysticism , which may be part of its appeal in europe ’ s “ god is dead ” era .
for example , the ideal of mindfulness , for which many adherents strive , simply describes the state of being fully present in the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagogue in berlin a recent magazine article about fun diversions for berliners suggested dabbling in mindfulness , only to conclude that being aware of your surroundings and the nice altbau architecture on the bike ride home was less efficient than mentally planning dinner . yet mindfulness isn ’ t about inefficiency - it ’ s about the power of non-fragmented attention to wake up to the surroundings . respond " mindfully " can be rewarding one morning , having forgotten as i usually do to turn off the heat in my apartment - not something i ’ m used to from growing up with building-wide controlled heating in new york - i ran back in to turn the knob and missed the impeccably punctual bus by about ten seconds . i began fuming , but instead of going with it , i tried to be mindful , taking a deep breath and thinking , “ hello , fuming .
what else is there in this minute alongside you ? ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell did n't have to worry about turning off the heating in new york city to al gore ’ s probable horror , i noticed it was an unseasonably warm and beautiful day . missing the bus was a great chance to walk to the next stop and enjoy the weather .
in other words , i paid a little attention to what was going on parallel to my own bundle of nerves and felt rewarded . mindfulness isn ’ t going to turn me into a completely “ zen ” individual any time soon , especially since living abroad seems to be a continual adaptation process , not one that eventually slows .
but by increasing self-awareness , it is a useful tool for better responding to the occasional frustration of living as a foreigner , such as not remembering how to express certain ideas in german or suffering through the lines at the ausländerbehörde -lrb- public office for foreigners -rrb- . now if i could just figure out how to respond mindfully to those scientology solicitors accosting passers-by outside of kadewe … arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns memory , one piece at a time after literally stumbling over a holocaust memorial in berlin , arden pennell investigated the history of berlin 's " stumbling stones . " -lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it .

by providing faster services , coupled with rising concern over the environmental impact of no-frills air travel , railway operators hope that customers will return to train travel . deutsche bahn 's european hub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new central station is seen as europe 's new hub deutsche bahn , the german railways operator , hope that its state-of-the-art new main station in berlin will act as a european hub for rail travel , and change the minds of those travelers who consider budget flights as their best option for reaching european cities .
in brussels , a modernization of the midi station into a true international hub serving the eurostar , tgv , thalys and ice services hope to have the same effect in the capital of the eu . the eu itself has come up with initiatives to open the rail market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems across the continent in line with each other on all major tracks in an attempt to increase efficiency and choice . european countries have been waking up to the need for bigger and better train systems for a number of years .
work began five years ago on the state-of-the-art paris-strasbourg tgv line , which opens to the public on june 10 .
one of the biggest rail projects in europe , it mobilized some 10,000 workers and required 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers . last month , it was on the paris-strasbourg line that the tgv broke its own world record by hitting a peak speed of 553 kilometers per hour during a test run .
it is to attempt a new high-velocity breakthrough in the coming weeks . new fast trains countering airline popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tgvs will cut journey times dramatically the new train will cut the paris-strasbourg trip to two hours and 20 minutes from the current four hours .
it will also slash travel time to points further east , making the trip from paris to luxembourg in about two hours , to frankfurt in less than four and to munich in six hours and fifteen minutes . " some 37 million europeans can be reached , " said tgv-est director alain le guellec .
" a network of high-speed links is being put into place with the rest of europe . " president jacques chirac thursday hailed the new rail service as a " major industry success , " saying it would generate economic growth and jobs . " this admirably demonstrates france 's capabilities in research , development and innovation , " chirac said , lauding trains as faster , cheaper and greener than planes . perben announced on monday that the second phase of construction - which will knock another half-hour off the journey time from paris to strasbourg , to one hour 50 minutes - would be brought forward from 2010 to 2008 . but there are doubts over whether the rail service will be commercially viable . the project cost of four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- is being shared among 22 financial partners at various levels of the french government , as well as luxembourg , the european union and the french state-owned railway sncf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees to partly privatize railway system germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to partly privatize the country 's federal rail system by 2009 , government officials announced on wednesday in berlin after months of wrangling .

missing the bus gave her a chance to practice zen-like mindfulness . the january opening of a church of scientology center in berlin has caused a stir of local concern about the “ brainwashing ” sect ’ s street-corner proselytizing .
meanwhile , the construction of a new mosque in pankow has riled up residents and right-wing politicians . yet alarmist fears and prejudiced indignation don ’ t interest me as much as another aspect of berlin ’ s religion-related happenings : the large buddhist community i have discovered here . the zen trend buddhism has become part of western leitkultur , from labeling a laid-back attitude as “ zen , ” as in , “ i wish i could be a little more zen about my work , ” to the smiling , seated buddha statuettes sold as trendy centerpieces , to richard gere ’ s “ free tibet ” campaigns with the dalai lama .
from slang to home furnishings to hollywood , buddhism pops up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin cathedral represents a different kind of religious tradition i didn ’ t come to germany to discover what lies beneath this superficial web of associations ; rather , the interest arose when i got here , causing me to wonder whether berlin was the right place to learn more .
the enormous , friendly , group of individuals i have since met has definitively proven that , although germans are allegedly less religious than ever , many have discovered a sort of non-dogma they can live by . in contrast to christianity and judaism , the two religions with the historically largest followings in germany , buddhism isn ’ t necessarily a faith-based system . it has a tradition of teachers who exhort their listeners to “ try it out ” before agreeing , and many major principles sound more like common sense than mysticism , which may be part of its appeal in europe ’ s “ god is dead ” era .
for example , the ideal of mindfulness , for which many adherents strive , simply describes the state of being fully present in the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagogue in berlin a recent magazine article about fun diversions for berliners suggested dabbling in mindfulness , only to conclude that being aware of your surroundings and the nice altbau architecture on the bike ride home was less efficient than mentally planning dinner . yet mindfulness isn ’ t about inefficiency - it ’ s about the power of non-fragmented attention to wake up to the surroundings . respond " mindfully " can be rewarding one morning , having forgotten as i usually do to turn off the heat in my apartment - not something i ’ m used to from growing up with building-wide controlled heating in new york - i ran back in to turn the knob and missed the impeccably punctual bus by about ten seconds . i began fuming , but instead of going with it , i tried to be mindful , taking a deep breath and thinking , “ hello , fuming .
what else is there in this minute alongside you ? ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arden pennell did n't have to worry about turning off the heating in new york city to al gore ’ s probable horror , i noticed it was an unseasonably warm and beautiful day . missing the bus was a great chance to walk to the next stop and enjoy the weather .
in other words , i paid a little attention to what was going on parallel to my own bundle of nerves and felt rewarded . mindfulness isn ’ t going to turn me into a completely “ zen ” individual any time soon , especially since living abroad seems to be a continual adaptation process , not one that eventually slows .
but by increasing self-awareness , it is a useful tool for better responding to the occasional frustration of living as a foreigner , such as not remembering how to express certain ideas in german or suffering through the lines at the ausländerbehörde -lrb- public office for foreigners -rrb- . now if i could just figure out how to respond mindfully to those scientology solicitors accosting passers-by outside of kadewe … arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns dw-world : memory , one piece at a time after literally stumbling over a holocaust memorial in berlin , arden pennell investigated the history of berlin 's " stumbling stones .

the cost of developing boverton place , in llantwit major , vale of glamorgan , however , could be at least a six-figure sum , an architect has warned .
overcoming planning restrictions because of the mansion 's historical status , could also be difficult .
interest in the auction of the property has been high and there are rumours a tv celebrity is among potential buyers .
details of boverton castle and the 0.94 of an acre of grounds surrounding it , went up on the website of herbert r thomas on saturday and has already attracted more than 2,400 hits .
philip thomas , who is handling the sale , said : " it 's doing quite well .
normally we have about 4,000 hits per auction .
a small group of shetland ponies currently graze in the castle grounds " we 've also had quite a few calls from all sorts of people .
people who are interested in old buildings , interested in investments and those interested in sheltering money in land and property . "
the same company arranged the auction of llantwit major castle last april but it was called off at the eleventh hour after welsh heritage agency cadw called for more talks about its future .
alan gillard , principal architect of gillard associates in llantwit major , has already been contacted by several people wondering what kind of development would be possible at boverton place .
" it 's a great opportunity for somebody , " he said .
" the trouble is , with planning laws as they are , it would be a severe problem for any development on that site .
tv celebrity " i suspect that 's why it 's at such a reasonable price - especially with almost an acre of land .
the fact is that the castle building is a scheduled ancient monument and grade ii listed is very off-putting . "
developing the site would be extremely costly , he said , due to the expense of stabilising the structure and coming up with a high-quality , energy efficient design .
specialist building techniques would also have to be brought in .
mr gillard also joked that there were rumours that a celebrity with her own tv show already had her eye on the castle , being auctioned at a guide price of between £ 55,000 - £ 80,000 impressive ruins according to folklore , the castle is haunted by the black lady who was spotted by men working on the castle in the early 19th century .
she was described as a tall , shadowy figure dressed in mourning clothes .
boverton place was built around 1587 by roger seys , a land owner and attorney general of wales .
the family moved out in the late 17th century and it fell into decay in the following century .
vivian kelly , from the llantwit major history society , said : " the seys line ended with a woman who married one of the joneses from fonmon castle , so it went into their hands .
they never lived there after that . "
the ruins have survived to " considerable height " and are " visually impressive " said a welsh assembly government spokesman .
he said : " in the case of ruinous buildings such as this , sustainable reuse , where feasible , can often present the best means by which its future can be secured .
" in principle , cadw would have no objections to the potential reuse of such buildings but planning permission from the local authority would also be needed . "

details of boverton castle and the 0.94 of an acre of grounds surrounding it , went up on the website of herbert r thomas on saturday and has already attracted more than 2,400 hits .
philip thomas , who is handling the sale , said : " it 's doing quite well .

the same company arranged the auction of llantwit major castle last april but it was called off at the eleventh hour after welsh heritage agency cadw called for more talks about its future .
alan gillard , principal architect of gillard associates in llantwit major , has already been contacted by several people wondering what kind of development would be possible at boverton place .

developing the site would be extremely costly , he said , due to the expense of stabilising the structure and coming up with a high-quality , energy efficient design .

mr gillard also joked that there were rumours that a celebrity with her own tv show already had her eye on the castle , being auctioned at a guide price of between £ 55,000 - £ 80,000 impressive ruins according to folklore , the castle is haunted by the black lady who was spotted by men working on the castle in the early 19th century .
she was described as a tall , shadowy figure dressed in mourning clothes .
boverton place was built around 1587 by roger seys , a land owner and attorney general of wales .
the family moved out in the late 17th century and it fell into decay in the following century .
vivian kelly , from the llantwit major history society , said : " the seys line ended with a woman who married one of the joneses from fonmon castle , so it went into their hands .
they never lived there after that . "
the ruins have survived to " considerable height " and are " visually impressive " said a welsh assembly government spokesman .
he said : " in the case of ruinous buildings such as this , sustainable reuse , where feasible , can often present the best means by which its future can be secured .
" in principle , cadw would have no objections to the potential reuse of such buildings but planning permission from the local authority would also be needed . "

female black labradors , flo and lucky , are being used by the authorities in malaysia in the battle against music and film rip-offs .
they are believed to be the first dogs in the world trained to sniff the chemicals used to make optical disks .
they can lead handlers to disks labelled as other items , but can not tell which are real and which are fake .
the month-long trial has seen the talented dogs move from belfast into kuala lumpur .
the three-year-old animals - trained by a handler in northern ireland who usually teaches dogs to find bombs - can find , but can not distinguish between , cds and dvds , burned and replicated disks , or legitimate and pirate disks .
the dogs take only 10 minutes to check boxes that security officials would have needed a day to examine .
" it 's cost-effective , and in terms of time , it 's very effective too , " said domestic trade minister shafie apdal , said .
jacuzzi the trial is a joint effort of the malaysian authorities and the motion picture association , which groups six major hollywood movie companies and has spent us $ 17,000 on training the dogs .
mike ellis from the mpa said labradors had a great aptitude for the work and were selected for their potential .
" they have been well trained to specifically smell the unique chemicals that go into polycarbonates and the solvents that glue the dvds together and they are very very effective at doing that , " he said .
he said the scale of piracy across the world was enormous and that the dogs could also be used to track down warehouses and stores .
the change in weather from a brisk spring in northern ireland has been a shock for the dogs , but they are acclimatising to their new working environment .
mr ellis said the dogs were getting some film star treatment themselves .
they are being put up in five star animal accommodation , which includes a jacuzzi to help them cool down after a hard day of hot footing it after dvd pirates .

mike ellis from the mpa said labradors had a great aptitude for the work and were selected for their potential .
" they have been well trained to specifically smell the unique chemicals that go into polycarbonates and the solvents that glue the dvds together and they are very very effective at doing that , " he said .
he said the scale of piracy across the world was enormous and that the dogs could also be used to track down warehouses and stores .
the change in weather from a brisk spring in northern ireland has been a shock for the dogs , but they are acclimatising to their new working environment .
mr ellis said the dogs were getting some film star treatment themselves .
they are being put up in five star animal accommodation , which includes a jacuzzi to help them cool down after a hard day of hot footing it after dvd pirates .

it also approved a bill ending preferential tax treatment for foreign firms , setting a standard rate of 25 % .
premier wen jiabao ended the session as he had begun it last week , promising a move to more sustainable growth .
he also raised issues such as corruption , regional ties and international fears over china 's military build-up .
contentious law china 's leaders have been struggling for decades to enact a law to cover private assets - seen an important step away from communist collective ownership and towards a market economy .
but some legislators feared that while the new property law would undoubtedly increase protection for home owners and prevent land seizures , it would also erode china 's socialist principles .
netizens unmoved by npc long road to property bill in fact , according to daniel griffiths , bbc correspondent in beijing , this has been one of the most contentious pieces of legislation introduced in china in recent times .
but despite the concerns , when it came to putting the bill to the vote , 99.1 % of the 2,889 legislators attending the npc backed the property law .
the tax legislation - designed to wean china off an export-driven economy dominated by the manufacture of cheap goods - was passed with only slightly less support .
these high percentages are not unusual .
the parliament - the national people 's congress -lrb- npc -rrb- - meets just once a year and is largely a rubber stamp to endorse the policies of the ruling communist party .
corruption crackdown legislators also discussed a wide variety of other issues during the two-week npc meeting - with one key theme being mr wen 's promise to focus more on sustainable development than rapid economic growth .
as he closed the session , mr wen fleshed out this theme , saying : " the priorities now are promoting equality in education opportunities , adopting progressive employment policies , narrowing income gaps and building social security networks . "
increasing equality is of vital concern to the communist party .
correspondents say that protests over the growing income differentials , exacerbated by rising corruption , are threatening its control over the rural hinterland .
mr wen promised more reforms to crack down on corruption , especially that involving high-ranking officials .
he blamed the increase in graft on an " over-concentration of power without effective and proper restraint and oversight " , and promised to address the issue as a priority .
in terms of foreign affairs , mr wen said he hoped his visit to japan in april would be an " ice-thawing " trip , following a period of tensions between the two nations over their wartime past .
he also said that china 's military expansion posed no threat to other countries - despite international concern over its military growth .
" the limited armed forces china has are completely for the purpose of safeguarding the country 's security , independence and sovereignty , " mr wen said .
he added that china was still opposed to the militarization of space , despite its recent test of an anti-satellite weapon .

the number of under-fives with the condition increased five-fold - meaning it affected one child in every 1,000 by 2004 , a study around oxford found .
other studies have revealed similar rises , suggesting the trend is true for the whole of the uk , diabetes uk said .
the bristol university team blame genes and environmental factors , including breastfeeding rates .
it must be due to changes in our environment researcher professor polly bingley the number of under-15s with the condition almost doubled during the study , which focused on 2.6 million people in and around the oxford region between 1985 and 2004 .
type 1 diabetes , also referred to insulin-dependent diabetes , generally develops in childhood and often runs in families .
in contrast , the far more common type 2 diabetes tends to develop later in life and is largely linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity .
of the estimated more than two million people with diabetes in the uk , around 250,000 have type 1 .
at least 20,000 children of school age in the uk have type 1 , according to the charity diabetes uk .
sign of the times lead researcher professor polly bingley said the rate of childhood type 1 diabetes was increasing all over europe , particularly in the very young .
she said the increase was too steep to be put down to genetic factors alone .
" so it must be due to changes in our environment .
" this could either mean that we are being exposed to something new , or that we now have reduced exposure to something that was previously controlling our immune responses . "
she suggested that fewer mums opting to breastfeed their babies might be a factor .
another possibility is that children are being exposed to fewer germs , affecting the development of their immune systems .
" we now need to work to identify what these changes might be . "
she presented her findings at diabetes uk 's annual conference .
simon o 'neill , director of care , information and advocacy services for the charity , added : " whilst 10 to 14-year-olds remain the largest group for diagnosis , the rise in cases found in children under five is worrying . "

international trade unions meeting in paris are set to call for a taskforce to investigate highly-leveraged deals .
the unions are worried that the debt used to finance such deals means that jobs have to be cut to boost short-term returns and pay back borrowings .

international trade unions meeting in paris are set to call for a taskforce to investigate highly-leveraged deals .
the unions are worried that the debt used to finance such deals means that jobs have to be cut to boost short-term returns and pay back borrowings .
private equity firms say they make companies more competitive which means better job security for employees .
unions were particularly critical of the case of the aa , which got rid of 3,000 staff - more than a quarter of its workforce - while it was owned by a leading private equity company : permira .
another permira purchase , birds eye , cut nearly 500 jobs with the closure of its factory in hull .
in europe last year , £ 118bn was spent in private equity takeovers , up 41 % from 2005 .
a consortium of private equity firms said recently it was considering whether to make a bid for supermarket group sainsbury 's .
' profit profit profit ' paul maloney , senior organiser for the gmb union said the problem was not just that workers are moved down the pecking order following such buyouts .
" employees do n't come into the pecking order with private equity firms - the only pecking order they have got is profit , profit , profit - bag it and run , " he said .
but peter linthwaite , chief executive of the british venture capital association said workers were more likely to get a stake in a business owned by private equity .
" ownership is at the core of what private equity is about - it is about giving people a sense of ownership in a business , " he said .
" it 's been shown by studies that post private equity investing in a company more share option schemes are put in place for the entire workforce than were there before . "

with the launch of the iphone , apple is looking to do the same again - set the trends , corner the market and leave everyone else looking like also-rans .
but selling phones to people is very different to selling them a portable music player .
to begin with , most people already have a mobile phone .
in the uk , upwards of 80 % of households have one .
worldwide , more than one billion handsets were shipped in 2006 .
by comparison apple , which has a more than a 70 % share of the mobile music player market , sold 39 million ipods in 2006 .
and with the iphone , apple will not be creating a market , it will be muscling in on a lot of very established companies .
direct competition a quick look at the technologies apple is pushing in the iphone shows that many others devices , either on shop shelves or about to be launched , share these features .
take the touchscreen , for instance .
many smartphones - which more resemble a pda than a plain handset - can be used with a stylus or a deft finger .
nokia 's 6708 and sonyericsson 's m600 and p990 are examples of this .
all are made for corporate road warriors and , it has to be said , they look like it .
sonyericsson also makes the w950 music-playing phone that has a touchscreen plus buttons , stylus and handwriting recognition .
it also looks a lot funkier than the business versions .
gilles oriol , product marketing manager for western europe at sonyericsson , declined the opportunity to talk directly about apple 's iphone .
" we do not comment on rival products , " he said .
but , he told the bbc news website , that he " doubted " that sonyericsson would ever make a phone that only had a touchscreen .
" it must remain a good telephone first , " he said , " consumers are more willing to dial a number with the keyboard than they are to do it with a touchscreen . "
" also , " he added , " the point about a touchscreen is that it affects battery time .
you need a powerful battery because to use the touchscreen means it remains on all the time . "
apple 's iphone is due to make its appearance in the us in june , but before the big day asian rivals will have launched handsets that will be in much more direct competition .
in february , samsung showed off the f700 that resembles the iphone in many ways .
the screen of the f700 is smaller at 2.78in -lrb- 7.06cm -rrb- compared with 3.5in -lrb- 8.9cm -rrb- for the iphone - but in almost every other respect they are very similar .
the two have comparable amounts of memory and features , but the f700 has the advantage of including a slide-out keyboard and a five megapixel camera .
by comparison , the iphone steve jobs showed off in january only has a two megapixel camera .
looks matter but the greatest competition for the iphone in terms of looks might come from the phone that lg has designed with italian fashion house prada .
not only does this have a touchscreen , but it also shares some of the sleek looks of the apple gadget .
lg 's prada phone john bernard , marketing manager for lg uk and ireland , said the prada phone was being designed long before apple made its announcement .
he said that prada had been looking for a partner to help it make and market handsets for several years .
prada oversaw the design process for the phone , he said , and had the final say on what it looked like and the way that people navigated through its many menus .
" it looks gorgeous and that 's what people are going to be buying it for , " he said .
so far lg has no plans to sell the phone in the us , believing the customers in europe and asia are a better fit for its charms .
it will be aimed at those who are aged between 20 and 45 , said mr bernard .
he admitted that the slimline look of the phone had meant some compromises on features such as onboard memory .
but , he said , for many consumers good looks outweighed features .
" the motorola razr is not a very well-specced device but it 's one of the most popular ever . "
the fact that people will buy for looks rather than features suggests , said mr bernard , that the mobile market is changing .
no longer do people buy phones for what they can do but for what they say about them as a person .
a fact that has worked well for apple when it comes to selling ipods - but the competition in the mobile world suggests that may be a tough act to follow .

in february , samsung showed off the f700 that resembles the iphone in many ways .
the screen of the f700 is smaller at 2.78in -lrb- 7.06cm -rrb- compared with 3.5in -lrb- 8.9cm -rrb- for the iphone - but in almost every other respect they are very similar .
the two have comparable amounts of memory and features , but the f700 has the advantage of including a slide-out keyboard and a five megapixel camera .
by comparison , the iphone steve jobs showed off in january only has a two megapixel camera .
looks matter but the greatest competition for the iphone in terms of looks might come from the phone that lg has designed with italian fashion house prada .
not only does this have a touchscreen , but it also shares some of the sleek looks of the apple gadget .
lg 's prada phone lg 's spokesman john bernard , marketing manager for lg uk and ireland , said the prada phone was being designed long before apple made its announcement .
he said that prada had been looking for a partner to help it make and market handsets for several years .
prada oversaw the design process for the phone , he said , and had the final say on what it looked like and the way that people navigated through its many menus .
" it looks gorgeous and that 's what people are going to be buying it for , " he said .
so far lg has no plans to sell the phone in the us , believing the customers in europe and asia are a better fit for its charms .
it will be aimed at those who are aged between 20 and 45 , said mr bernard .
he admitted that the slimline look of the phone had meant some compromises on features such as onboard memory .
but , he said , for many consumers good looks outweighed features .
" the motorola razr is not a very well-specced device but it 's one of the most popular ever . "
the fact that people will buy for looks rather than features suggests , said mr bernard , that the mobile market is changing .
no longer do people buy phones for what they can do but for what they say about them as a person .
a fact that has worked well for apple when it comes to selling ipods - but the competition in the mobile world suggests that may be a tough act to follow .

sonyericsson also makes the w950 music-playing phone that has a touchscreen plus buttons , stylus and handwriting recognition .
it also looks a lot funkier than the business versions .
the iphone is not the only mobile with a touchscreen gilles oriol , product marketing manager for western europe at sonyericsson , declined the opportunity to talk directly about apple 's iphone .
" we do not comment on rival products , " he said .
but , he told the bbc news website , that he " doubted " that sonyericsson would ever make a phone that only had a touchscreen .
" it must remain a good telephone first , " he said , " consumers are more willing to dial a number with the keyboard than they are to do it with a touchscreen . "
" also , " he added , " the point about a touchscreen is that it affects battery time .
you need a powerful battery because to use the touchscreen means it remains on all the time . "
apple 's iphone is due to make its appearance in the us in june , but before the big day asian rivals will have launched handsets that will be in much more direct competition .
in february , samsung showed off the f700 that resembles the iphone in many ways .
the screen of the f700 is smaller at 2.78in -lrb- 7.06cm -rrb- compared with 3.5in -lrb- 8.9cm -rrb- for the iphone - but in almost every other respect they are very similar .
the two have comparable amounts of memory and features , but the f700 has the advantage of including a slide-out keyboard and a five megapixel camera .
by comparison , the iphone steve jobs showed off in january only has a two megapixel camera .
looks matter but the greatest competition for the iphone in terms of looks might come from the phone that lg has designed with italian fashion house prada .
not only does this have a touchscreen , but it also shares some of the sleek looks of the apple gadget .
lg 's prada phone lg 's spokesman john bernard , marketing manager for lg uk and ireland , said the prada phone was being designed long before apple made its announcement .
he said that prada had been looking for a partner to help it make and market handsets for several years .
prada oversaw the design process for the phone , he said , and had the final say on what it looked like and the way that people navigated through its many menus .
" it looks gorgeous and that 's what people are going to be buying it for , " he said .
so far lg has no plans to sell the phone in the us , believing the customers in europe and asia are a better fit for its charms .
it will be aimed at those who are aged between 20 and 45 , said mr bernard .
he admitted that the slimline look of the phone had meant some compromises on features such as onboard memory .
but , he said , for many consumers good looks outweighed features .
" the motorola razr is not a very well-specced device but it 's one of the most popular ever . "
the fact that people will buy for looks rather than features suggests , said mr bernard , that the mobile market is changing .
no longer do people buy phones for what they can do but for what they say about them as a person .
a fact that has worked well for apple when it comes to selling ipods - but the competition in the mobile world suggests that may be a tough act to follow .

by comparison apple , which has a more than a 70 % share of the mobile music player market , sold 39 million ipods in 2006 .
and with the iphone , apple will not be creating a market , it will be muscling in on a lot of very established companies .
direct competition a quick look at the technologies apple is pushing in the iphone shows that many others devices , either on shop shelves or about to be launched , share these features .
take the touchscreen , for instance .
many smartphones - which more resemble a pda than a plain handset - can be used with a stylus or a deft finger .
nokia 's 6708 and sonyericsson 's m600 and p990 are examples of this .
all are made for corporate road warriors and , it has to be said , they look like it .
sonyericsson also makes the w950 music-playing phone that has a touchscreen plus buttons , stylus and handwriting recognition .
it also looks a lot funkier than the business versions .
the iphone is not the only mobile with a touchscreen gilles oriol , product marketing manager for western europe at sonyericsson , declined the opportunity to talk directly about apple 's iphone .
" we do not comment on rival products , " he said .
but , he told the bbc news website , that he " doubted " that sonyericsson would ever make a phone that only had a touchscreen .
" it must remain a good telephone first , " he said , " consumers are more willing to dial a number with the keyboard than they are to do it with a touchscreen . "
" also , " he added , " the point about a touchscreen is that it affects battery time .
you need a powerful battery because to use the touchscreen means it remains on all the time . "
apple 's iphone is due to make its appearance in the us in june , but before the big day asian rivals will have launched handsets that will be in much more direct competition .
in february , samsung showed off the f700 that resembles the iphone in many ways .
the screen of the f700 is smaller at 2.78in -lrb- 7.06cm -rrb- compared with 3.5in -lrb- 8.9cm -rrb- for the iphone - but in almost every other respect they are very similar .
the two have comparable amounts of memory and features , but the f700 has the advantage of including a slide-out keyboard and a five megapixel camera .
by comparison , the iphone steve jobs showed off in january only has a two megapixel camera .
looks matter but the greatest competition for the iphone in terms of looks might come from the phone that lg has designed with italian fashion house prada .
not only does this have a touchscreen , but it also shares some of the sleek looks of the apple gadget .
lg 's prada phone lg 's spokesman john bernard , marketing manager for lg uk and ireland , said the prada phone was being designed long before apple made its announcement .
he said that prada had been looking for a partner to help it make and market handsets for several years .
prada oversaw the design process for the phone , he said , and had the final say on what it looked like and the way that people navigated through its many menus .
" it looks gorgeous and that 's what people are going to be buying it for , " he said .
so far lg has no plans to sell the phone in the us , believing the customers in europe and asia are a better fit for its charms .
it will be aimed at those who are aged between 20 and 45 , said mr bernard .
he admitted that the slimline look of the phone had meant some compromises on features such as onboard memory .
but , he said , for many consumers good looks outweighed features .
" the motorola razr is not a very well-specced device but it 's one of the most popular ever . "
the fact that people will buy for looks rather than features suggests , said mr bernard , that the mobile market is changing .
no longer do people buy phones for what they can do but for what they say about them as a person .
a fact that has worked well for apple when it comes to selling ipods - but the competition in the mobile world suggests that may be a tough act to follow .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- bloggers turn up heat on zimbabwe bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 16 march 2007 , 09:19 gmt bloggers turn up heat on zimbabwe turmoil in zimbabwe this week refocused the world 's attention on the 27-year rule of president robert mugabe .
the world of blogging was no exception as the bbc news website discovered .
from harare , bev clark writing on kubatanablogs offered an interesting analogy about the country 's situation . "
no doubt the fall-out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet " the bearded man " i 've been seeing zimbabwe like a cake lately , " she wrote on the day opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , arrested for attending a weekend rally , was taken to hospital after two days in police detention .
" morgan tsvangirai , raymond majongwe , mike davies , and grace kwinje -lrb- etc -rrb- are the candles burning big and bright .
the icing is made up of a small section of civic and political activists .
while the actual cake itself comprises the zimbabwean people . "
that is not where it ends , the cake , it seems , has just been put in the oven .
" until we , the zimbabwean people , come to the party and support civic and political leaders working for change , not much will happen .
the cake has got to cook .
it 's got to get warm , and bake and maybe even burn , but it ca n't stay like it has been - unmovable .
" because if it does , no matter how many highfield rallies we have , and no matter how iconic tsvangirai becomes , the struggle for freedom in zimbabwe will remain lop-sided . "
the bearded man is also not convinced that this is the beginning of the end of mr mugabe 's rule , as some commentators would have it . "
the only reason the british government is anti-mugabe is they still consider zimbabwe to be rhodesia " steph 's blog " no doubt the fall-out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet - and the dirty underbelly of african politics ... "
he then goes on to echo a plea made by many western governments to zimbabwe 's immediate neighbours .
" please would someone out there actually do something about this mugabe person ? "
' cowardice ' who exactly is being asked to do something ?
well , south africa - zimbabwe 's powerful neighbour to the south - for a start .
" south africa 's so called ' quiet diplomacy ' has achieved precisely nothing in zimbabwe , " blogged tony sharp on the waendel journal . "
britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade zimbabwe than it did iraq " the radical soldier of zimbabwe !
" its call to mugabe yesterday to respect the rights of citizens will change nothing .
mugabe , like his ilk elsewhere in the world , recognises cowardice when he sees it and knows that talk is cheap . "
in a volatile situation where perceptions of events are so important , the zimbabwe pundit - subtitled " the world as seen through the eyes of a zimbabwean " - seems to be losing patience with the opposition in the country .
" the media in zimbabwe is owned and operated by the mugabe regime .
so in sunday 's aftermath zimbabweans are being force fed a diet of mdc thuggery , non-attendance and opposition violence .
this makes me wonder when the pro-democracy movement will get its act together in terms of creating its own robust media and information response unit . "
steph 's blog would beg to differ though - and sticks the boot into the bbc while she is at it , comparing a report on violence at an opposition rally on sunday in state-owned the herald newspaper with one of ours .
" the herald is a zimbabwean government-owned newspaper and the bbc is a british government-owned broadcaster .
the herald 's version is pro-mugabe and pro-police but at least it was there , the bbc was n't .
its version is mdc propaganda , with a little bit of british imperialism chucked in , " she blogged .
" morgan tsvangirai is a western-sponsored ' terrorist ' , he plotted in london to assassinate mugabe and overthrow the elected government .
there is nothing democratic about the mdc .
the only reason the british government is anti-mugabe is they still consider zimbabwe to be rhodesia . "
' breached conditions ' the radical soldier of zimbabwe ! , meanwhile , is having none of it and offers what could be a radical solution to challenges facing the country .
" europe intervened in the balkans and the ' coalition of the willing ' did a job in iraq , but nobody seems to care about zimbabwe , " he lamented .
" britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade zimbabwe than it did iraq .
britain was the former colonial power in rhodesia and negotiated the lancaster house agreement .
the agreement is actually worth reading .
it sets out the principles under which democratic zimbabwe should have been governed , and was in fact governed for the first few years .
" mugabe has clearly violated the agreement .
he has breached conditions including white representation in parliament -lsb- nb this clause has expired -rsb- , independence of the judiciary , citizenship and payment of pensions .
these should be sufficient grounds for britain to demand change or otherwise invade .
who knows ?
maybe john howard will even commit a couple of hundred australian troops . "
laer from orange county california sees little chance of this happening though - mainly because of another world power .
" the big problem for me is that china does n't seem to care .

the world of blogging was no exception as the bbc news website discovered .
from harare , bev clark writing on kubatanablogs offered an interesting analogy about the country 's situation .
no doubt the fall-out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet the bearded man " i 've been seeing zimbabwe like a cake lately , " she wrote on the day opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , arrested for attending a weekend rally , was taken to hospital after two days in police detention .
" morgan tsvangirai , raymond majongwe , mike davies , and grace kwinje -lrb- etc -rrb- are the candles burning big and bright .
the icing is made up of a small section of civic and political activists .
while the actual cake itself comprises the zimbabwean people . "
that is not where it ends , the cake , it seems , has just been put in the oven .
" until we , the zimbabwean people , come to the party and support civic and political leaders working for change , not much will happen .
the cake has got to cook .
it 's got to get warm , and bake and maybe even burn , but it ca n't stay like it has been - unmovable .
" because if it does , no matter how many highfield rallies we have , and no matter how iconic tsvangirai becomes , the struggle for freedom in zimbabwe will remain lop-sided . "
the bearded man is also not convinced that this is the beginning of the end of mr mugabe 's rule , as some commentators would have it .
the only reason the british government is anti-mugabe is they still consider zimbabwe to be rhodesia steph 's blog " no doubt the fall-out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet - and the dirty underbelly of african politics ... "
he then goes on to echo a plea made by many western governments to zimbabwe 's immediate neighbours .
" please would someone out there actually do something about this mugabe person ? "
' cowardice ' who exactly is being asked to do something ?
well , south africa - zimbabwe 's powerful neighbour to the south - for a start .
" south africa 's so called ' quiet diplomacy ' has achieved precisely nothing in zimbabwe , " blogged tony sharp on the waendel journal .
britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade zimbabwe than it did iraq the radical soldier of zimbabwe !
" its call to mugabe yesterday to respect the rights of citizens will change nothing .
mugabe , like his ilk elsewhere in the world , recognises cowardice when he sees it and knows that talk is cheap . "
in a volatile situation where perceptions of events are so important , the zimbabwe pundit - subtitled " the world as seen through the eyes of a zimbabwean " - seems to be losing patience with the opposition in the country .
" the media in zimbabwe is owned and operated by the mugabe regime .
so in sunday 's aftermath zimbabweans are being force fed a diet of mdc thuggery , non-attendance and opposition violence .
this makes me wonder when the pro-democracy movement will get its act together in terms of creating its own robust media and information response unit . "
steph 's blog would beg to differ though - and sticks the boot into the bbc while she is at it , comparing a report on violence at an opposition rally on sunday in state-owned the herald newspaper with one of ours .
" the herald is a zimbabwean government-owned newspaper and the bbc is a british government-owned broadcaster .
the herald 's version is pro-mugabe and pro-police but at least it was there , the bbc was n't .
its version is mdc propaganda , with a little bit of british imperialism chucked in , " she blogged .
" morgan tsvangirai is a western-sponsored ' terrorist ' , he plotted in london to assassinate mugabe and overthrow the elected government .
there is nothing democratic about the mdc .
the only reason the british government is anti-mugabe is they still consider zimbabwe to be rhodesia . "
' breached conditions ' the radical soldier of zimbabwe ! , meanwhile , is having none of it and offers what could be a radical solution to challenges facing the country .
laer blames china for the un 's weakness vis-a-vis zimbabwe " europe intervened in the balkans and the ' coalition of the willing ' did a job in iraq , but nobody seems to care about zimbabwe , " he lamented .
" britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade zimbabwe than it did iraq .
britain was the former colonial power in rhodesia and negotiated the lancaster house agreement .
the agreement is actually worth reading .
it sets out the principles under which democratic zimbabwe should have been governed , and was in fact governed for the first few years .
" mugabe has clearly violated the agreement .
he has breached conditions including white representation in parliament -lsb- nb this clause has expired -rsb- , independence of the judiciary , citizenship and payment of pensions .
these should be sufficient grounds for britain to demand change or otherwise invade .
who knows ?
maybe john howard will even commit a couple of hundred australian troops . "
laer from orange county california sees little chance of this happening though - mainly because of another world power .
" the big problem for me is that china does n't seem to care .
it will continue to block un efforts to protect zimbabweans from mugabe , proving once again the powerlessness of the world body , " he blogged on cheat seeking missiles .

the world of blogging was no exception as the bbc news website discovered .
from harare , bev clark writing on kubatanablogs offered an interesting analogy about the country 's situation .
no doubt the fall-out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet the bearded man " i 've been seeing zimbabwe like a cake lately , " she wrote on the day opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , arrested for attending a weekend rally , was taken to hospital after two days in police detention .
" morgan tsvangirai , raymond majongwe , mike davies , and grace kwinje -lrb- etc -rrb- are the candles burning big and bright .
the icing is made up of a small section of civic and political activists .
while the actual cake itself comprises the zimbabwean people . "
that is not where it ends , the cake , it seems , has just been put in the oven .
" until we , the zimbabwean people , come to the party and support civic and political leaders working for change , not much will happen .
the cake has got to cook .
it 's got to get warm , and bake and maybe even burn , but it ca n't stay like it has been - unmovable .
" because if it does , no matter how many highfield rallies we have , and no matter how iconic tsvangirai becomes , the struggle for freedom in zimbabwe will remain lop-sided . "
the bearded man is also not convinced that this is the beginning of the end of mr mugabe 's rule , as some commentators would have it .
the only reason the british government is anti-mugabe is they still consider zimbabwe to be rhodesia steph 's blog " no doubt the fall-out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet - and the dirty underbelly of african politics ... "
he then goes on to echo a plea made by many western governments to zimbabwe 's immediate neighbours .
" please would someone out there actually do something about this mugabe person ? "
' cowardice ' who exactly is being asked to do something ?
well , south africa - zimbabwe 's powerful neighbour to the south - for a start .
" south africa 's so called ' quiet diplomacy ' has achieved precisely nothing in zimbabwe , " blogged tony sharp on the waendel journal .
britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade zimbabwe than it did iraq the radical soldier of zimbabwe !
" its call to mugabe yesterday to respect the rights of citizens will change nothing .
mugabe , like his ilk elsewhere in the world , recognises cowardice when he sees it and knows that talk is cheap . "
in a volatile situation where perceptions of events are so important , the zimbabwe pundit - subtitled " the world as seen through the eyes of a zimbabwean " - seems to be losing patience with the opposition in the country .
" the media in zimbabwe is owned and operated by the mugabe regime .
so in sunday 's aftermath zimbabweans are being force fed a diet of mdc thuggery , non-attendance and opposition violence .
this makes me wonder when the pro-democracy movement will get its act together in terms of creating its own robust media and information response unit . "
steph 's blog would beg to differ though - and sticks the boot into the bbc while she is at it , comparing a report on violence at an opposition rally on sunday in state-owned the herald newspaper with one of ours .
" the herald is a zimbabwean government-owned newspaper and the bbc is a british government-owned broadcaster .
the herald 's version is pro-mugabe and pro-police but at least it was there , the bbc was n't .
its version is mdc propaganda , with a little bit of british imperialism chucked in , " she blogged .
" morgan tsvangirai is a western-sponsored ' terrorist ' , he plotted in london to assassinate mugabe and overthrow the elected government .
there is nothing democratic about the mdc .
the only reason the british government is anti-mugabe is they still consider zimbabwe to be rhodesia . "
' breached conditions ' the radical soldier of zimbabwe ! , meanwhile , is having none of it and offers what could be a radical solution to challenges facing the country .
laer blames china for the un 's weakness vis-a-vis zimbabwe " europe intervened in the balkans and the ' coalition of the willing ' did a job in iraq , but nobody seems to care about zimbabwe , " he lamented .
" britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade zimbabwe than it did iraq .
britain was the former colonial power in rhodesia and negotiated the lancaster house agreement .
the agreement is actually worth reading .
it sets out the principles under which democratic zimbabwe should have been governed , and was in fact governed for the first few years .
" mugabe has clearly violated the agreement .
he has breached conditions including white representation in parliament -lsb- nb this clause has expired -rsb- , independence of the judiciary , citizenship and payment of pensions .
these should be sufficient grounds for britain to demand change or otherwise invade .
who knows ?
maybe john howard will even commit a couple of hundred australian troops . "
laer from orange county california sees little chance of this happening though - mainly because of another world power .
" the big problem for me is that china does n't seem to care .
it will continue to block un efforts to protect zimbabweans from mugabe , proving once again the powerlessness of the world body , " he blogged on cheat seeking missiles .
so is there any hope at all ?
" from what i can see , the un is frozen , the african union is powerless to do anything , and the world just watches , " he said .

as usual we invited your thoughts too .
here is a selection of the responses .
starting school at a early age is better .
i started school when i was three , starting at a young age , makes you more responsability and strong .
you learn to take parts in activities , you learn numbers , everything and certainly makes you ready for the wider society and further study .
jessica , london i definitely believe children who attend an early years setting benefit and will settle in to school life with less difficulty than those who do n't .
however the problem is often nursery fees are very high so low income families may loose out as parents can not afford to send their children to a private nursery setting .
the introduction to reception at four is definatley a better option , it eases children into school life before too much formality .
samantha murray , stoke / staffordshire i think it is important for children to learn about social relationships , and the ability to play with each other .
this strengths the social bonds , and the older they are when they start formal education , the more they will undersand that education is another factor in their life experience .
basic social skills must be learnt as early as possible , as it is more diffult to change destructive social behaviour when people are older .
eileen jenkins , edinburgh comparisons with other european countries need to take account of two important differences .
dutch , german , swedish , danish , norwegian , finnish , spanish , italian and welsh all have simple orthographies , with all or a very high proportion of words pronounced in a very predictable manner .
learning to read english is more complicated .
in the uk , extended families in one house have become rare .
i learnt to read from my grandmother , who lived in the same house as my -lrb- very busy -rrb- parents , before i went to school .
households with two working parents and no other adults are unlikely to provide this sort of intellectual foundation .
single parents are likely to be even less capable .
k c moore , reading , berkshire i strongly agree that there is too much emphasis on early formal education .
my three-year-old is having the same lessons at school nursery that her brother received in reception / year one just four years ago .
i believe better quality education begun at age five to six would be at least as effective .
leisl badham , birmingham this is a very interesting and timely column , i think .
mike is right to emphasise the important of giving children a play-based curriculum with a strong emphasis on care and their emotional and social development .
but the generalisation that there is an english / french tradition that in the early years the focus should be on " preparing children for school " is n't quite right .
there is a very long , well-documented tradition in england that puts the emphasis in early childhood on play , movement , being outdoors , making choices etc - it 's been happening in english nursery schools for decades , inspired most notably by the work of margaret and rachel macmillan .
by nursery school , i mean very specifically the local-authority maintained schools for children before the start of compulsory education .
julian grenier , london as headteacher of an infant school i wholeheartedly endorse the views expressed in this article .
my children are drawn from a mixed catchment area and there are pockets of great deprivation .
what on earth is the point in trying to teach some of these four year olds to read and write when they do n't have the language to string together a proper sentence ?
some of our children are language poor - this needs to be addressed first and can be done very successfully through each of the areas of learning of the foundation stage .
some of our children have not had the play experiences that enable them to develop their co-ordination or fine motor skills to a sufficient point to be able to write .
when will those outside education acknowledge that our children need to experience a childhood full of all sorts of rich experiences and language if they are to grow up to be at least reasonably successful adults ?
mari street , whitwick , england extend the foundation stage curriculum to the end of ks1 .
place an emphasis on speaking and listening , investigation and learning through play .
create powerful indoor and outdoor learning worlds which mesh seamlessly as the child travels through on his / her quest for answers , discussion , nurture and stimulation .
we know it works .
we want out children no matter what their age to see their work as play .
mary coen , sutton , surrey i quite agree with mike baker 's comments .
an early stimulating environment either in the home or in pre-school activities should be much more than preparing them for school .
there is too much presuure to perform for certain narrow criteria that growing as individuals with individual gifts gets squashed in the rush to make them read and write .
other skills are important also , verbal skills , fine motor skills , learning to be active are far more important than learning to fail and yet will aid reading and writing later on .
joanna , usa i am a deputy head in a secondary school with two daughters in nursery and i must say seeing this report last week made my blood boil .
i take a great professional interest in the progress of students and have been involved with many projects to engage boys through better provision and delivery of education .
my two and three-year-old girls are very happy in nursery , interacting with others through play , taking pride in the paintings they produce and gaining life skills that will enable them to master calculation and language when the need arises - much later .
ofsted really needs to worry about improtant things .
andy ireland , sheffield the problem with choosing a school starting age is that all children develop at different rates .
some have the maturity and skills to undertake formal learning at five whilst others are slower to mature and would benefit from a less structured curriculum up to the age of seven.the ideal ' diet ' is an extended , creative foundation stage for the under 7 's with opportunities for children that are ready and motivated to turn to formal literacy / numeracy activities as they are ready .
what is crucial is motivation and enjoyment .
the current system tries to treat all children the same and this holds back the progress of some and imparts a sense of failure to others .
amanda smith , wheathampstead , hertfordshire since the introduction of the foundation stage curriculum guidance there has been a growing awareness of the developmental needs of young children , and teachers in this stage plan to meet these needs , placing a greater emphasis on their social and cognitive progress than on the more " academic " areas .
this does not mean that literacy and numeracy are neglected - rather the understanding is developed through practical and play activities .
many children enter the reception class with limited vocabularies and few conversational skills .
spoken language skills must be developed before children can learn to read and write , but this does not mean that they are not encouraged to enjoy stories and information books , play matching games , sort and count in situations that are relevant to them and engage in mark making and pre-writing activities .
the problem is , and has been over a long period , that ofsted is dominated by " experts " who do not understand child development , or the needs !

as usual we invited your thoughts too .
here is a selection of the responses .
starting school at a early age is better .
i started school when i was three , starting at a young age , makes you more responsability and strong .
you learn to take parts in activities , you learn numbers , everything and certainly makes you ready for the wider society and further study .
jessica , london i definitely believe children who attend an early years setting benefit and will settle in to school life with less difficulty than those who do n't .
however the problem is often nursery fees are very high so low income families may loose out as parents can not afford to send their children to a private nursery setting .
the introduction to reception at four is definatley a better option , it eases children into school life before too much formality .
samantha murray , stoke / staffordshire i think it is important for children to learn about social relationships , and the ability to play with each other .
this strengths the social bonds , and the older they are when they start formal education , the more they will undersand that education is another factor in their life experience .
basic social skills must be learnt as early as possible , as it is more diffult to change destructive social behaviour when people are older .
eileen jenkins , edinburgh comparisons with other european countries need to take account of two important differences .
dutch , german , swedish , danish , norwegian , finnish , spanish , italian and welsh all have simple orthographies , with all or a very high proportion of words pronounced in a very predictable manner .
learning to read english is more complicated .
in the uk , extended families in one house have become rare .
i learnt to read from my grandmother , who lived in the same house as my -lrb- very busy -rrb- parents , before i went to school .
households with two working parents and no other adults are unlikely to provide this sort of intellectual foundation .
single parents are likely to be even less capable .
k c moore , reading , berkshire i strongly agree that there is too much emphasis on early formal education .
my three-year-old is having the same lessons at school nursery that her brother received in reception / year one just four years ago .
i believe better quality education begun at age five to six would be at least as effective .
leisl badham , birmingham this is a very interesting and timely column , i think .
mike is right to emphasise the important of giving children a play-based curriculum with a strong emphasis on care and their emotional and social development .
but the generalisation that there is an english / french tradition that in the early years the focus should be on " preparing children for school " is n't quite right .
there is a very long , well-documented tradition in england that puts the emphasis in early childhood on play , movement , being outdoors , making choices etc - it 's been happening in english nursery schools for decades , inspired most notably by the work of margaret and rachel macmillan .
by nursery school , i mean very specifically the local-authority maintained schools for children before the start of compulsory education .
julian grenier , london as headteacher of an infant school i wholeheartedly endorse the views expressed in this article .
my children are drawn from a mixed catchment area and there are pockets of great deprivation .
what on earth is the point in trying to teach some of these four year olds to read and write when they do n't have the language to string together a proper sentence ?
some of our children are language poor - this needs to be addressed first and can be done very successfully through each of the areas of learning of the foundation stage .
some of our children have not had the play experiences that enable them to develop their co-ordination or fine motor skills to a sufficient point to be able to write .
when will those outside education acknowledge that our children need to experience a childhood full of all sorts of rich experiences and language if they are to grow up to be at least reasonably successful adults ?
mari street , whitwick , england extend the foundation stage curriculum to the end of ks1 .
place an emphasis on speaking and listening , investigation and learning through play .
create powerful indoor and outdoor learning worlds which mesh seamlessly as the child travels through on his / her quest for answers , discussion , nurture and stimulation .
we know it works .
we want out children no matter what their age to see their work as play .
mary coen , sutton , surrey i quite agree with mike baker 's comments .
an early stimulating environment either in the home or in pre-school activities should be much more than preparing them for school .
there is too much presuure to perform for certain narrow criteria that growing as individuals with individual gifts gets squashed in the rush to make them read and write .
other skills are important also , verbal skills , fine motor skills , learning to be active are far more important than learning to fail and yet will aid reading and writing later on .
joanna , usa i am a deputy head in a secondary school with two daughters in nursery and i must say seeing this report last week made my blood boil .
i take a great professional interest in the progress of students and have been involved with many projects to engage boys through better provision and delivery of education .
my two and three-year-old girls are very happy in nursery , interacting with others through play , taking pride in the paintings they produce and gaining life skills that will enable them to master calculation and language when the need arises - much later .
ofsted really needs to worry about improtant things .
andy ireland , sheffield the problem with choosing a school starting age is that all children develop at different rates .
some have the maturity and skills to undertake formal learning at five whilst others are slower to mature and would benefit from a less structured curriculum up to the age of seven.the ideal ' diet ' is an extended , creative foundation stage for the under 7 's with opportunities for children that are ready and motivated to turn to formal literacy / numeracy activities as they are ready .
what is crucial is motivation and enjoyment .
the current system tries to treat all children the same and this holds back the progress of some and imparts a sense of failure to others .
amanda smith , wheathampstead , hertfordshire since the introduction of the foundation stage curriculum guidance there has been a growing awareness of the developmental needs of young children , and teachers in this stage plan to meet these needs , placing a greater emphasis on their social and cognitive progress than on the more " academic " areas .
this does not mean that literacy and numeracy are neglected - rather the understanding is developed through practical and play activities .
many children enter the reception class with limited vocabularies and few conversational skills .
spoken language skills must be developed before children can learn to read and write , but this does not mean that they are not encouraged to enjoy stories and information books , play matching games , sort and count in situations that are relevant to them and engage in mark making and pre-writing activities .
the problem is , and has been over a long period , that ofsted is dominated by " experts " who do not understand child development , or the needs !

as usual we invited your thoughts too .
here is a selection of the responses .
starting school at a early age is better .
i started school when i was three , starting at a young age , makes you more responsability and strong .
you learn to take parts in activities , you learn numbers , everything and certainly makes you ready for the wider society and further study .
jessica , london i definitely believe children who attend an early years setting benefit and will settle in to school life with less difficulty than those who do n't .
however the problem is often nursery fees are very high so low income families may loose out as parents can not afford to send their children to a private nursery setting .
the introduction to reception at four is definatley a better option , it eases children into school life before too much formality .
samantha murray , stoke / staffordshire i think it is important for children to learn about social relationships , and the ability to play with each other .
this strengths the social bonds , and the older they are when they start formal education , the more they will undersand that education is another factor in their life experience .
basic social skills must be learnt as early as possible , as it is more diffult to change destructive social behaviour when people are older .
eileen jenkins , edinburgh comparisons with other european countries need to take account of two important differences .
dutch , german , swedish , danish , norwegian , finnish , spanish , italian and welsh all have simple orthographies , with all or a very high proportion of words pronounced in a very predictable manner .
learning to read english is more complicated .
in the uk , extended families in one house have become rare .
i learnt to read from my grandmother , who lived in the same house as my -lrb- very busy -rrb- parents , before i went to school .
households with two working parents and no other adults are unlikely to provide this sort of intellectual foundation .
single parents are likely to be even less capable .
k c moore , reading , berkshire i strongly agree that there is too much emphasis on early formal education .
my three-year-old is having the same lessons at school nursery that her brother received in reception / year one just four years ago .
i believe better quality education begun at age five to six would be at least as effective .
leisl badham , birmingham this is a very interesting and timely column , i think .
mike is right to emphasise the important of giving children a play-based curriculum with a strong emphasis on care and their emotional and social development .
but the generalisation that there is an english / french tradition that in the early years the focus should be on " preparing children for school " is n't quite right .
there is a very long , well-documented tradition in england that puts the emphasis in early childhood on play , movement , being outdoors , making choices etc - it 's been happening in english nursery schools for decades , inspired most notably by the work of margaret and rachel macmillan .
by nursery school , i mean very specifically the local-authority maintained schools for children before the start of compulsory education .
julian grenier , london as headteacher of an infant school i wholeheartedly endorse the views expressed in this article .
my children are drawn from a mixed catchment area and there are pockets of great deprivation .
what on earth is the point in trying to teach some of these four year olds to read and write when they do n't have the language to string together a proper sentence ?
some of our children are language poor - this needs to be addressed first and can be done very successfully through each of the areas of learning of the foundation stage .
some of our children have not had the play experiences that enable them to develop their co-ordination or fine motor skills to a sufficient point to be able to write .
when will those outside education acknowledge that our children need to experience a childhood full of all sorts of rich experiences and language if they are to grow up to be at least reasonably successful adults ?
mari street , whitwick , england extend the foundation stage curriculum to the end of ks1 .
place an emphasis on speaking and listening , investigation and learning through play .
create powerful indoor and outdoor learning worlds which mesh seamlessly as the child travels through on his / her quest for answers , discussion , nurture and stimulation .
we know it works .
we want out children no matter what their age to see their work as play .
mary coen , sutton , surrey i quite agree with mike baker 's comments .
an early stimulating environment either in the home or in pre-school activities should be much more than preparing them for school .
there is too much presuure to perform for certain narrow criteria that growing as individuals with individual gifts gets squashed in the rush to make them read and write .
other skills are important also , verbal skills , fine motor skills , learning to be active are far more important than learning to fail and yet will aid reading and writing later on .
joanna , usa i am a deputy head in a secondary school with two daughters in nursery and i must say seeing this report last week made my blood boil .
i take a great professional interest in the progress of students and have been involved with many projects to engage boys through better provision and delivery of education .
my two and three-year-old girls are very happy in nursery , interacting with others through play , taking pride in the paintings they produce and gaining life skills that will enable them to master calculation and language when the need arises - much later .
ofsted really needs to worry about improtant things .
andy ireland , sheffield the problem with choosing a school starting age is that all children develop at different rates .
some have the maturity and skills to undertake formal learning at five whilst others are slower to mature and would benefit from a less structured curriculum up to the age of seven.the ideal ' diet ' is an extended , creative foundation stage for the under 7 's with opportunities for children that are ready and motivated to turn to formal literacy / numeracy activities as they are ready .
what is crucial is motivation and enjoyment .
the current system tries to treat all children the same and this holds back the progress of some and imparts a sense of failure to others .
amanda smith , wheathampstead , hertfordshire since the introduction of the foundation stage curriculum guidance there has been a growing awareness of the developmental needs of young children , and teachers in this stage plan to meet these needs , placing a greater emphasis on their social and cognitive progress than on the more " academic " areas .
this does not mean that literacy and numeracy are neglected - rather the understanding is developed through practical and play activities .
many children enter the reception class with limited vocabularies and few conversational skills .
spoken language skills must be developed before children can learn to read and write , but this does not mean that they are not encouraged to enjoy stories and information books , play matching games , sort and count in situations that are relevant to them and engage in mark making and pre-writing activities .
the problem is , and has been over a long period , that ofsted is dominated by " experts " who do not understand child development , or the needs !

as usual we invited your thoughts too .
here is a selection of the responses .
starting school at a early age is better .
i started school when i was three , starting at a young age , makes you more responsability and strong .
you learn to take parts in activities , you learn numbers , everything and certainly makes you ready for the wider society and further study .
jessica , london i definitely believe children who attend an early years setting benefit and will settle in to school life with less difficulty than those who do n't .
however the problem is often nursery fees are very high so low income families may loose out as parents can not afford to send their children to a private nursery setting .
the introduction to reception at four is definatley a better option , it eases children into school life before too much formality .
samantha murray , stoke / staffordshire i think it is important for children to learn about social relationships , and the ability to play with each other .
this strengths the social bonds , and the older they are when they start formal education , the more they will undersand that education is another factor in their life experience .
basic social skills must be learnt as early as possible , as it is more diffult to change destructive social behaviour when people are older .
eileen jenkins , edinburgh comparisons with other european countries need to take account of two important differences .
dutch , german , swedish , danish , norwegian , finnish , spanish , italian and welsh all have simple orthographies , with all or a very high proportion of words pronounced in a very predictable manner .
learning to read english is more complicated .
in the uk , extended families in one house have become rare .
i learnt to read from my grandmother , who lived in the same house as my -lrb- very busy -rrb- parents , before i went to school .
households with two working parents and no other adults are unlikely to provide this sort of intellectual foundation .
single parents are likely to be even less capable .
k c moore , reading , berkshire i strongly agree that there is too much emphasis on early formal education .
my three-year-old is having the same lessons at school nursery that her brother received in reception / year one just four years ago .
i believe better quality education begun at age five to six would be at least as effective .
leisl badham , birmingham this is a very interesting and timely column , i think .
mike is right to emphasise the important of giving children a play-based curriculum with a strong emphasis on care and their emotional and social development .
but the generalisation that there is an english / french tradition that in the early years the focus should be on " preparing children for school " is n't quite right .
there is a very long , well-documented tradition in england that puts the emphasis in early childhood on play , movement , being outdoors , making choices etc - it 's been happening in english nursery schools for decades , inspired most notably by the work of margaret and rachel macmillan .
by nursery school , i mean very specifically the local-authority maintained schools for children before the start of compulsory education .
julian grenier , london as headteacher of an infant school i wholeheartedly endorse the views expressed in this article .
my children are drawn from a mixed catchment area and there are pockets of great deprivation .
what on earth is the point in trying to teach some of these four year olds to read and write when they do n't have the language to string together a proper sentence ?
some of our children are language poor - this needs to be addressed first and can be done very successfully through each of the areas of learning of the foundation stage .
some of our children have not had the play experiences that enable them to develop their co-ordination or fine motor skills to a sufficient point to be able to write .
when will those outside education acknowledge that our children need to experience a childhood full of all sorts of rich experiences and language if they are to grow up to be at least reasonably successful adults ?
mari street , whitwick , england extend the foundation stage curriculum to the end of ks1 .
place an emphasis on speaking and listening , investigation and learning through play .
create powerful indoor and outdoor learning worlds which mesh seamlessly as the child travels through on his / her quest for answers , discussion , nurture and stimulation .
we know it works .
we want out children no matter what their age to see their work as play .
mary coen , sutton , surrey i quite agree with mike baker 's comments .
an early stimulating environment either in the home or in pre-school activities should be much more than preparing them for school .
there is too much presuure to perform for certain narrow criteria that growing as individuals with individual gifts gets squashed in the rush to make them read and write .
other skills are important also , verbal skills , fine motor skills , learning to be active are far more important than learning to fail and yet will aid reading and writing later on .
joanna , usa i am a deputy head in a secondary school with two daughters in nursery and i must say seeing this report last week made my blood boil .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- rich populist woos romanians bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 16 march 2007 , 10:57 gmt rich populist woos romanians by oana lungescu european affairs correspondent , bucharest less than three months after romania joined the eu , the country is in deep political crisis , with the president and prime minister accusing each other of lying and corruption .
meanwhile , a third man is climbing in the polls .
he is gigi becali , the multi-millionaire boss of the champion steaua football club .
from humble beginnings as a shepherd , mr becali made his fortune in real estate after the fall of communism to become one of romania 's richest men and the second most popular politician after the president himself .
his new generation party -lrb- png -rrb- headquarters is as flamboyant as the man - a palace in bucharest being polished back to its former glory with no expense spared .
restorers carefully apply gold leaf to every moulding , while gigi becali , a dark-haired man in his late forties , looks on whistling o sole mio .
in berlusconi 's footsteps his soulmate among european politicians is silvio berlusconi .
like the former italian prime minister , mr becali wants to use football and money to get to the top .
but he is also a devout orthodox christian .
i met him on his return from mount athos , the holiest site in eastern orthodoxy .
he often goes there in a private jet to pray before key matches .
his office looks more like a shrine , with byzantine icons on every wall , a life-size painting of himself as st john in the desert and on his desk a statuette of his namesake st george killing the dragon .
" i too want to kill the devil in romania , the corruption and lies , " he tells me , with an eye on the huge tv screen in the corner to check how often his own face pops up on the news channel .
so how does he explain his spectacular rise from shepherd to multi-millionaire politician ?
" in the byzantine empire , the great kings were shepherds .
and if you want me to quote the bible , jesus did n't say i am your captain or your driver , but i am your shepherd .
so in romanian politics , i see myself as an apostle because i 'm trying to do something no one has tried before " , he said .
" now that europe has been reunited , i also want to see a spiritual reunification of europe , i want western christian-democracy to be enriched by eastern orthodoxy .
if we do n't counter sin with faith , then the end of the world is nigh , " mr becali says .
fan base this messianic tone goes down well in a country where the orthodox church is the most trusted institution .
football too enjoys cult status .
at a match in the black sea port of constanta , i saw steaua fans furiously chanting and waving their red and blue banners .
some even had flags that looked suspiciously like iron crosses .
notorious for their violence and their racist taunts against hungarian , roma or black players , they are a force to be reckoned with , on the pitch and at the polls .
" gigi would make romania a cleaner and fairer country , because he has faith in god and he wants to clean out the mafia , " one young man said .
" he helps poor people , he understands their difficulties , while other politicians do nothing , " said another .
help for poor for leading political analyst alina mungiu-pippidi , mr becali " satisfies an important need in the voters right now - the need to denounce the whole corruption of the political system " .
" he managed to create an image for himself of a person who not just speaks differently from the rest of the political class , but also is different .
he 's a man of his word , he is a provider , he delivers what he says he does , " alina mungiu-pippidi says . "
he 's so generous , he deserves to become president " eleonora lazar , villager the proof can be seen in a village in eastern romania called vadu-rosca .
it is now known as becali 's village .
the houses here were swept away by catastrophic floods two years ago .
then came mr becali in his trademark maybach limousine and promised to build them all up again .
and so he did .
eleonora lazar showed me into one of 200 identical small white bungalows , all built by mr becali .
a widow with three children , she told me she had more faith in the football boss than in the government .
" he 's so generous , he deserves to become president , " she says .
" why should we elect someone who did n't even bother about us ?
we pray for him every day , for his health and so people should stop accusing him of all sorts of things .
he 's never done anything bad , " mrs lazar told me .
mr becali has fought off accusations of tax evasion and dodgy deals .
he equally rejects any charges of extremism and intolerance .
anti-gay stance but what about an offer he made last year to give a few million dollars to anyone who would root out homosexuality in romania ?
amid the faint smell of incense that pervades his office and with three bodyguards looking on , he got visibly angry . "
homosexuality is a sin " gigi becali " i love homosexuals like everyone else .
i have nothing against them .
but i insist , it 's a sin .
and i will repeat it everywhere , including in the european parliament , because i 'm not afraid of any european policy or whatever , homosexuality is a sin , and that 's that ! " he shouted .
if he is elected , i asked him , what are the first three things he plans to do ?
" i will ask god to give me wisdom , " came the answer after a pause .
" he will tell me , this is the first thing you should do , this is the second , and this is the third .
i ca n't tell you now what god will tell me then . "
mr becali 's parting words were just as striking .
" we 'll see , " he told me with a smile , " if you are on the side of god or on that of the devil . "
in one of europe 's poorest countries , his voice is unashamedly anti-liberal , promising some sort of salvation to those angered and frustrated with conventional party politics .
political turmoil mr becali 's party is gaining ground on the more established greater romania party , which recently caused a stir in the european parliament by helping to form a new ultra-nationalist group . "
people like becali are the product of a certain failure in our political transition " alina mungiu-pippidi , political analyst polls credit png 's list headed by gigi becali with 10-15 % of the vote , which could see it wining four to six seats of the 35 allotted to romania in the european parliament .
but as alina mungiu-pippidi explains , it is not just happening in romania .
" people like becali and others in central europe , where everywhere radical populism is on the rise , are the product of a certain failure in our political transition , " she says .
" our transitions were very successful economically , they succeeded in bringing our countries into the eu , but did n't succeed in creating normal politics .
if becali fails , it 's going to be somebody else .
the problem is that normal politics do n't manage to deliver as they should , " mrs mungiu-pippidi says .

meanwhile , a third man is climbing in the polls .
he is gigi becali , the multi-millionaire boss of the champion steaua football club .
from humble beginnings as a shepherd , mr becali made his fortune in real estate after the fall of communism to become one of romania 's richest men and the second most popular politician after the president himself .
his new generation party -lrb- png -rrb- headquarters is as flamboyant as the man - a palace in bucharest being polished back to its former glory with no expense spared .
restorers carefully apply gold leaf to every moulding , while gigi becali , a dark-haired man in his late forties , looks on whistling o sole mio .
in berlusconi 's footsteps his soulmate among european politicians is silvio berlusconi .
like the former italian prime minister , mr becali wants to use football and money to get to the top .
but he is also a devout orthodox christian .
becali is depicted as st john i met him on his return from mount athos , the holiest site in eastern orthodoxy .
he often goes there in a private jet to pray before key matches .
his office looks more like a shrine , with byzantine icons on every wall , a life-size painting of himself as st john in the desert and on his desk a statuette of his namesake st george killing the dragon .
" i too want to kill the devil in romania , the corruption and lies , " he tells me , with an eye on the huge tv screen in the corner to check how often his own face pops up on the news channel .
so how does he explain his spectacular rise from shepherd to multi-millionaire politician ?
" in the byzantine empire , the great kings were shepherds .
and if you want me to quote the bible , jesus did n't say i am your captain or your driver , but i am your shepherd .
so in romanian politics , i see myself as an apostle because i 'm trying to do something no one has tried before " , he said .
" now that europe has been reunited , i also want to see a spiritual reunification of europe , i want western christian-democracy to be enriched by eastern orthodoxy .
if we do n't counter sin with faith , then the end of the world is nigh , " mr becali says .
fan base this messianic tone goes down well in a country where the orthodox church is the most trusted institution .
football too enjoys cult status .
steaua football supporters are notorious for racist taunts at a match in the black sea port of constanta , i saw steaua fans furiously chanting and waving their red and blue banners .
some even had flags that looked suspiciously like iron crosses .
notorious for their violence and their racist taunts against hungarian , roma or black players , they are a force to be reckoned with , on the pitch and at the polls .
" gigi would make romania a cleaner and fairer country , because he has faith in god and he wants to clean out the mafia , " one young man said .
" he helps poor people , he understands their difficulties , while other politicians do nothing , " said another .
help for poor for leading political analyst alina mungiu-pippidi , mr becali " satisfies an important need in the voters right now - the need to denounce the whole corruption of the political system " .
" he managed to create an image for himself of a person who not just speaks differently from the rest of the political class , but also is different .
he 's a man of his word , he is a provider , he delivers what he says he does , " alina mungiu-pippidi says .
he 's so generous , he deserves to become president eleonora lazar , villager the proof can be seen in a village in eastern romania called vadu-rosca .
it is now known as becali 's village .
the houses here were swept away by catastrophic floods two years ago .
then came mr becali in his trademark maybach limousine and promised to build them all up again .
and so he did .
eleonora lazar showed me into one of 200 identical small white bungalows , all built by mr becali .
a widow with three children , she told me she had more faith in the football boss than in the government .
" he 's so generous , he deserves to become president , " she says .
" why should we elect someone who did n't even bother about us ?
we pray for him every day , for his health and so people should stop accusing him of all sorts of things .
he 's never done anything bad , " mrs lazar told me .
mr becali has fought off accusations of tax evasion and dodgy deals .
he equally rejects any charges of extremism and intolerance .
anti-gay stance but what about an offer he made last year to give a few million dollars to anyone who would root out homosexuality in romania ?
amid the faint smell of incense that pervades his office and with three bodyguards looking on , he got visibly angry .
homosexuality is a sin gigi becali " i love homosexuals like everyone else .
i have nothing against them .
but i insist , it 's a sin .
and i will repeat it everywhere , including in the european parliament , because i 'm not afraid of any european policy or whatever , homosexuality is a sin , and that 's that ! " he shouted .
if he is elected , i asked him , what are the first three things he plans to do ?
" i will ask god to give me wisdom , " came the answer after a pause .
" he will tell me , this is the first thing you should do , this is the second , and this is the third .
i ca n't tell you now what god will tell me then . "
mr becali 's parting words were just as striking .
" we 'll see , " he told me with a smile , " if you are on the side of god or on that of the devil . "
in one of europe 's poorest countries , his voice is unashamedly anti-liberal , promising some sort of salvation to those angered and frustrated with conventional party politics .
political turmoil mr becali 's party is gaining ground on the more established greater romania party , which recently caused a stir in the european parliament by helping to form a new ultra-nationalist group .
people like becali are the product of a certain failure in our political transition alina mungiu-pippidi , political analyst polls credit png 's list headed by gigi becali with 10-15 % of the vote , which could see it wining four to six seats of the 35 allotted to romania in the european parliament .
but as alina mungiu-pippidi explains , it is not just happening in romania .
" people like becali and others in central europe , where everywhere radical populism is on the rise , are the product of a certain failure in our political transition , " she says .
" our transitions were very successful economically , they succeeded in bringing our countries into the eu , but did n't succeed in creating normal politics .
if becali fails , it 's going to be somebody else .
the problem is that normal politics do n't manage to deliver as they should , " mrs mungiu-pippidi says .
if he fails , mr becali told me he would buy a few thousand sheep , make cheese and stop answering journalists ' questions .
but many fear his flock will be the stray sheep of romania 's long transition to democracy .

despite booming prices around the country , the cheapest properties , all in the north of england , have still been selling for less than £ 30,000 .
the prices are sometimes depressed by " right to buy " sales and regeneration or demolition plans in the street .
the analysis is based on land registry sales figures since 2000 .
compiled by the mouseprice.com web site , which re-sells land registry data to would-be house buyers , the figures reveal a continued north-south divide that affects the bottom end of the property market just as much as the top end .
an examination of sale prices , in streets where at least five properties have been sold since april 2000 , reveals that the top 20 cheapest streets in england and wales are all in either the north-west of england , the north east , yorkshire or humberside .
location , location , location one concentration of very cheap properties is in the towns of nelson and burnley , near blackburn in lancashire , where there has been widespread compulsory purchase and demolition of very old houses as part of government-inspired " regeneration " plans .

the latest issue to grip iranian expatriates is the hollywood blockbuster 300 .
according to the protesters , it projects an " irresponsible " and " distorted " image of ancient persia .
the film , which has broken us box office records , is a special effects-laden depiction of a battle in which a small spartan army resisted a persian invasion .
it is based on frank miller 's epic graphic novel about the battle of thermopylae in 480 bc .

the latest issue to grip iranian expatriates is the hollywood blockbuster 300 .
according to the protesters , it projects an " irresponsible " and " distorted " image of ancient persia .
the film , which has broken us box office records , is a special effects-laden depiction of a battle in which a small spartan army resisted a persian invasion .
it is based on frank miller 's epic graphic novel about the battle of thermopylae in 480 bc .
the film shows the spartan king and his army of 300 - white , muscular soldiers - strongly resisting xerxes and his savage persian army of hundreds of thousands .
loud opposition the film has stirred controversy among iranians across the world , but it is the expatriate community in north america that have been the loudest voice opposing an " assault on its culture and tradition " .
iranian bloggers started their campaign against the film a week ahead of its opening .

iranian officials have joined the angry protests and some are seeing it as part of a wider campaign against iran .
javad shamaqdari , a cultural advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was " plundering iran 's historic past and insulting this civilization " .
he branded the film " psychological warfare " against tehran and its people .
a daily iranian newspaper , ayandeh-no , recently carried the headline " hollywood declares war on iranians " .

the changes to carlos ghosn 's role come as the firm heads for its first annual profit fall in seven years .
the move is intended to create a more effective management structure and strengthen nissan 's ailing domestic and us operations , the firm said .
under the changes , hiroto saikawa , who oversees the european market , will take over the americas from mr ghosn .
' multiple challenges ' mr ghosn will focus on heading nissan , japan 's third biggest carmaker , and its partner , renault , from 1 april .
" the priority for our new management team is to act decisively on the multiple challenges facing nissan and to boost our overall performance in 2007 , " mr ghosn said .
mr ghosn , known for his success in turning around firms , is under pressure to boost stalled momentum at both renault and nissan , following disappointing sales and profits in the past year .
in february , nissan slashed its annual profit forecast after a 22 % slump in earnings in the last three months of 2006 .
in contrast , nissan 's rivals reported strong earnings , with toyota , japan 's biggest carmaker , reporting a 19 % rise and honda a 5 % rise in profits in the final quarter of 2006 .
toyota and honda have continued to perform well in the us with their fuel-efficient vehicles , whereas nissan has been slower to embrace gas-electric hybrids .
in a further development , nissan said it would cut production at japanese plants in oppama and tochigi from april to reduce inventory levels .
nissan declined to provide details of the size of the cuts .
