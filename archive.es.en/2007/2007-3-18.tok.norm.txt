most young people are not interested , but older adults seem to have a growing interest in walking and hiking , " brämer said . getting away from the daily grind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time out from the craziness of modern living brämer , who leads a research group and the university of marburg on the topic , puts it down to our " high-tech society that demands more and more of us , " creating " mental exhaustion " leading many to look to nature for a break . the german recreational walking federation , which has 600,000 members , has also noticed the rising interest .
" prior to the last 10 or 15 years it was still seen as very old-fashioned , but people have rediscovered it .
the image has changed , it 's is now associated with tourism and a balanced lifestyle , " said ingo seifert-rösing , publicity adviser to the federation . there is also an interest in connecting with the local landscape .
the marketing of new routes like the rhinesteig trail , which covers over 320 kilometers from wiesbaden to bonn , has also played a role in increasing awareness of the hiking possibilities in the country . business is booming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : put on the snow shoes !
winter does n't stop keen hikers the rheinsteig , which was named germany 's most beautiful hiking route in 2006 , takes over 20 days to complete , but can be broken up into smaller day trips .
it has attracted more than 100,000 people since opening 18 months ago , and has provided a huge boost to tourism and local businesses in the area . " many routes are now more varied and more excitingly than in former times .
and good hiking trails are a good way to draw new people in , " said brämer .
" hiking is an enormous market for hospitality , clothing and shoe industries . " the hikers ' associations are also eager to interest people over the age of 60 in the work of the federation .
attracted by guided tours and opportunity to socialist , people in this age group are frequently out and about .
" many people do n't discover walking until they are in their mid-40s or early 50s , " said seifert-rösing . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitting the german slopes - indoors and out germany has over 400 places to snap your boots into bindings and hit the slopes .

" more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps .

" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps .

" why sell pepsi-cola when you can get coca-cola free ?

" why sell pepsi-cola when you can get coca-cola free ?

" i have to admit that i think that this is an uphill task , certainly to do it during the german presidency , " beckett said in remarks released before the politics show on bbc 1 . beckett added that the picture would not be clear until after the french presidential elections , " and that comes quite close to the end of their -lrb- germany 's -rrb- presidency . " asked if there was a consensus around the new package , she replied : " oh , not remotely . " sticking points remain the original draft constitution , aimed at streamlining eu decision-making , was signed by all member states but was suspended after french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett beckett said there were many sticking points , not least of which was persuading the french and the dutch that their concerns were being met . " the french and the dutch have to be able to say that this is different because otherwise they will only get turned over again and , you know , that is not an easy problem to resolve , " she said . she said she could envision circumstances in which a constitution could be ratified without a referendum , but much work had to be done to achieve a consensus and some politicians had to be more ambitious about change . " there 's been a certain kind of mood music , shall we say , from some quarters that , oh well , really hardly anything needs to change , " she said . to date 18 of the 27 eu nations have formally ratified the constitution treaty . the german government has stressed its wish to revive the treaty and prepare a revised text as close as possible to the original draft prepared by an eu intergovernmental committee . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 18.03.2007 eu warns against further delays to galileo system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to make a profit from competing with the american navigation system the european commission warned that it will examine new ways to complete the galileo satellite navigation system after the project stalled amid doubts about profitability . the system , worth around 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.95 billion -rrb- and meant to be in space in 2010 , is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft and providing europe with commercial and strategic navigational autonomy . in a letter sent last week to the european union 's german presidency , transport commissioner jacques barrot requested a mandate to study " reasonable alternatives " to the current galileo consortium of eight private contractors . stepping up the rhetoric , he accused industry giants aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales of being responsible for delays in the project . late , expensive , no one in control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a civilian alternative to the us military 's gps " i consider that the delay so far accumulated and the absence of any sign of progress ... must now be considered as risk for the delivery of the project in the timeline that we envisaged , " barrot wrote . " moreover , we have to fear significant cost increases which could go well beyond the foreseen budget , " he said in the letter , which was also sent to the eight contractors and the european parliament .
" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps . " there is a doubt over the revenues , " an unnamed executive told the paper .
" why sell pepsi-cola when you can get coca-cola free ? " while it is difficult to see what real alternatives to the big eight barrot has , the commissioner said he wanted to set a may 10 deadline for the companies to act , and expects to receive a mandate to make such a demand next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is n't alone in developing a satellite navigation system he said he would review the companies ' reactions and recommend how the project should proceed to eu transport minister in june . competition moving forward in contrast to gps , which is run by the us defence department , galileo will be used for civilian purposes only . the european satellite navigation system will monitor natural disasters , in air and sea rescue services and a range of commercial uses , including possibly road safety and pricing . the eu fears that china could launch a competitor before galileo is fully operational .

" moreover , we have to fear significant cost increases which could go well beyond the foreseen budget , " he said in the letter , which was also sent to the eight contractors and the european parliament .
" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps . " there is a doubt over the revenues , " an unnamed executive told the paper .
" why sell pepsi-cola when you can get coca-cola free ? " while it is difficult to see what real alternatives to the big eight barrot has , the commissioner said he wanted to set a may 10 deadline for the companies to act , and expects to receive a mandate to make such a demand next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is n't alone in developing a satellite navigation system he said he would review the companies ' reactions and recommend how the project should proceed to eu transport minister in june . competition moving forward in contrast to gps , which is run by the us defence department , galileo will be used for civilian purposes only . the european satellite navigation system will monitor natural disasters , in air and sea rescue services and a range of commercial uses , including possibly road safety and pricing . the eu fears that china could launch a competitor before galileo is fully operational .

" i have to admit that i think that this is an uphill task , certainly to do it during the german presidency , " beckett said in remarks released before the politics show on bbc 1 . beckett added that the picture would not be clear until after the french presidential elections , " and that comes quite close to the end of their -lrb- germany 's -rrb- presidency . " asked if there was a consensus around the new package , she replied : " oh , not remotely . " sticking points remain the original draft constitution , aimed at streamlining eu decision-making , was signed by all member states but was suspended after french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett beckett said there were many sticking points , not least of which was persuading the french and the dutch that their concerns were being met . " the french and the dutch have to be able to say that this is different because otherwise they will only get turned over again and , you know , that is not an easy problem to resolve , " she said . she said she could envision circumstances in which a constitution could be ratified without a referendum , but much work had to be done to achieve a consensus and some politicians had to be more ambitious about change . " there 's been a certain kind of mood music , shall we say , from some quarters that , oh well , really hardly anything needs to change , " she said . to date 18 of the 27 eu nations have formally ratified the constitution treaty . the german government has stressed its wish to revive the treaty and prepare a revised text as close as possible to the original draft prepared by an eu intergovernmental committee . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

books on the subject are bestsellers , and about 8 million people put on their walking shoes at least once a month , brämer said . " we have watched the steadily numbers increasing for years .
most young people are not interested , but older adults seem to have a growing interest in walking and hiking , " brämer said . getting away from the daily grind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time out from the craziness of modern living brämer , who leads a research group and the university of marburg on the topic , puts it down to our " high-tech society that demands more and more of us , " creating " mental exhaustion " leading many to look to nature for a break . the german recreational walking federation , which has 600,000 members , has also noticed the rising interest .
" prior to the last 10 or 15 years it was still seen as very old-fashioned , but people have rediscovered it .
the image has changed , it 's is now associated with tourism and a balanced lifestyle , " said ingo seifert-rösing , publicity adviser to the federation . there is also an interest in connecting with the local landscape .

winter does n't stop keen hikers the rheinsteig , which was named germany 's most beautiful hiking route in 2006 , takes over 20 days to complete , but can be broken up into smaller day trips .
it has attracted more than 100,000 people since opening 18 months ago , and has provided a huge boost to tourism and local businesses in the area . " many routes are now more varied and more excitingly than in former times .
and good hiking trails are a good way to draw new people in , " said brämer .
" hiking is an enormous market for hospitality , clothing and shoe industries . " the hikers ' associations are also eager to interest people over the age of 60 in the work of the federation .
attracted by guided tours and opportunity to socialist , people in this age group are frequently out and about .
" many people do n't discover walking until they are in their mid-40s or early 50s , " said seifert-rösing . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitting the german slopes - indoors and out germany has over 400 places to snap your boots into bindings and hit the slopes .

" moreover , we have to fear significant cost increases which could go well beyond the foreseen budget , " he said in the letter , which was also sent to the eight contractors and the european parliament .
" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps .

" i have to admit that i think that this is an uphill task , certainly to do it during the german presidency , " beckett said in remarks released before the politics show on bbc 1 . beckett added that the picture would not be clear until after the french presidential elections , " and that comes quite close to the end of their -lrb- germany 's -rrb- presidency .

" i have to admit that i think that this is an uphill task , certainly to do it during the german presidency , " beckett said in remarks released before the politics show on bbc 1 . beckett added that the picture would not be clear until after the french presidential elections , " and that comes quite close to the end of their -lrb- germany 's -rrb- presidency . " asked if there was a consensus around the new package , she replied : " oh , not remotely . " sticking points remain the original draft constitution , aimed at streamlining eu decision-making , was signed by all member states but was suspended after french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett beckett said there were many sticking points , not least of which was persuading the french and the dutch that their concerns were being met . " the french and the dutch have to be able to say that this is different because otherwise they will only get turned over again and , you know , that is not an easy problem to resolve , " she said . she said she could envision circumstances in which a constitution could be ratified without a referendum , but much work had to be done to achieve a consensus and some politicians had to be more ambitious about change . " there 's been a certain kind of mood music , shall we say , from some quarters that , oh well , really hardly anything needs to change , " she said . to date 18 of the 27 eu nations have formally ratified the constitution treaty . the german government has stressed its wish to revive the treaty and prepare a revised text as close as possible to the original draft prepared by an eu intergovernmental committee . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

" moreover , we have to fear significant cost increases which could go well beyond the foreseen budget , " he said in the letter , which was also sent to the eight contractors and the european parliament .
" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps . " there is a doubt over the revenues , " an unnamed executive told the paper .
" why sell pepsi-cola when you can get coca-cola free ? " while it is difficult to see what real alternatives to the big eight barrot has , the commissioner said he wanted to set a may 10 deadline for the companies to act , and expects to receive a mandate to make such a demand next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is n't alone in developing a satellite navigation system he said he would review the companies ' reactions and recommend how the project should proceed to eu transport minister in june . competition moving forward in contrast to gps , which is run by the us defence department , galileo will be used for civilian purposes only . the european satellite navigation system will monitor natural disasters , in air and sea rescue services and a range of commercial uses , including possibly road safety and pricing . the eu fears that china could launch a competitor before galileo is fully operational .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2007 eu warns against further delays to galileo system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to make a profit from competing with the american navigation system the european commission warned that it will examine new ways to complete the galileo satellite navigation system after the project stalled amid doubts about profitability . the system , worth around 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.95 billion -rrb- and meant to be in space in 2010 , is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft and providing europe with commercial and strategic navigational autonomy . in a letter sent last week to the european union 's german presidency , transport commissioner jacques barrot requested a mandate to study " reasonable alternatives " to the current galileo consortium of eight private contractors . stepping up the rhetoric , he accused industry giants aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales of being responsible for delays in the project . late , expensive , no one in control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a civilian alternative to the us military 's gps " i consider that the delay so far accumulated and the absence of any sign of progress ... must now be considered as risk for the delivery of the project in the timeline that we envisaged , " barrot wrote . " moreover , we have to fear significant cost increases which could go well beyond the foreseen budget , " he said in the letter , which was also sent to the eight contractors and the european parliament .
" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps . " there is a doubt over the revenues , " an unnamed executive told the paper .

" more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps .

" i have to admit that i think that this is an uphill task , certainly to do it during the german presidency , " beckett said in remarks released before the politics show on bbc 1 . beckett added that the picture would not be clear until after the french presidential elections , " and that comes quite close to the end of their -lrb- germany 's -rrb- presidency . " asked if there was a consensus around the new package , she replied : " oh , not remotely . " sticking points remain the original draft constitution , aimed at streamlining eu decision-making , was signed by all member states but was suspended after french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett beckett said there were many sticking points , not least of which was persuading the french and the dutch that their concerns were being met . " the french and the dutch have to be able to say that this is different because otherwise they will only get turned over again and , you know , that is not an easy problem to resolve , " she said . she said she could envision circumstances in which a constitution could be ratified without a referendum , but much work had to be done to achieve a consensus and some politicians had to be more ambitious about change . " there 's been a certain kind of mood music , shall we say , from some quarters that , oh well , really hardly anything needs to change , " she said . to date 18 of the 27 eu nations have formally ratified the constitution treaty . the german government has stressed its wish to revive the treaty and prepare a revised text as close as possible to the original draft prepared by an eu intergovernmental committee . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

" moreover , we have to fear significant cost increases which could go well beyond the foreseen budget , " he said in the letter , which was also sent to the eight contractors and the european parliament .
" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps . " there is a doubt over the revenues , " an unnamed executive told the paper .
" why sell pepsi-cola when you can get coca-cola free ? " while it is difficult to see what real alternatives to the big eight barrot has , the commissioner said he wanted to set a may 10 deadline for the companies to act , and expects to receive a mandate to make such a demand next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is n't alone in developing a satellite navigation system he said he would review the companies ' reactions and recommend how the project should proceed to eu transport minister in june . competition moving forward in contrast to gps , which is run by the us defence department , galileo will be used for civilian purposes only . the european satellite navigation system will monitor natural disasters , in air and sea rescue services and a range of commercial uses , including possibly road safety and pricing . the eu fears that china could launch a competitor before galileo is fully operational .

" i have to admit that i think that this is an uphill task , certainly to do it during the german presidency , " beckett said in remarks released before the politics show on bbc 1 . beckett added that the picture would not be clear until after the french presidential elections , " and that comes quite close to the end of their -lrb- germany 's -rrb- presidency . " asked if there was a consensus around the new package , she replied : " oh , not remotely . " sticking points remain the original draft constitution , aimed at streamlining eu decision-making , was signed by all member states but was suspended after french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett beckett said there were many sticking points , not least of which was persuading the french and the dutch that their concerns were being met . " the french and the dutch have to be able to say that this is different because otherwise they will only get turned over again and , you know , that is not an easy problem to resolve , " she said . she said she could envision circumstances in which a constitution could be ratified without a referendum , but much work had to be done to achieve a consensus and some politicians had to be more ambitious about change . " there 's been a certain kind of mood music , shall we say , from some quarters that , oh well , really hardly anything needs to change , " she said . to date 18 of the 27 eu nations have formally ratified the constitution treaty . the german government has stressed its wish to revive the treaty and prepare a revised text as close as possible to the original draft prepared by an eu intergovernmental committee . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 18.03.2007 eu warns against further delays to galileo system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to make a profit from competing with the american navigation system the european commission warned that it will examine new ways to complete the galileo satellite navigation system after the project stalled amid doubts about profitability . the system , worth around 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.95 billion -rrb- and meant to be in space in 2010 , is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft and providing europe with commercial and strategic navigational autonomy . in a letter sent last week to the european union 's german presidency , transport commissioner jacques barrot requested a mandate to study " reasonable alternatives " to the current galileo consortium of eight private contractors . stepping up the rhetoric , he accused industry giants aena , alcatel , eads , finmeccanica , hispasat , inmarsat , teleop and thales of being responsible for delays in the project . late , expensive , no one in control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a civilian alternative to the us military 's gps " i consider that the delay so far accumulated and the absence of any sign of progress ... must now be considered as risk for the delivery of the project in the timeline that we envisaged , " barrot wrote . " moreover , we have to fear significant cost increases which could go well beyond the foreseen budget , " he said in the letter , which was also sent to the eight contractors and the european parliament .
" i will undertake to explore alternatives for delivering the project , based on a detailed technical , financial , program management review . " barrot complained there was no single company structure to regroup the partners , nor any negotiator to speak with the galileo supervisory authority , the public body overseeing the project . delays expected to continue negotiations to set up a consortium have been suspended as the companies involved are at loggerheads over sharing development costs , and a final agreement on a 20-year services and satellite contract is also unlikely to be completed before the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo plan is already running behind schedule barrot 's spokesman said the timetable for putting the system , to ultimately involve around 30 satellites , in place had already been delayed until 2011 , and that more slippage was expected . " more than ever we have a responsibility to make this project succeed , ensuring at the same time europe 's independence and excellence in a sector critical to our future competitiveness , " barrot added . can galileo make a profit ? the financial times newspaper said there were doubts whether galileo could attract enough revenue , as people within the project doubted whether it would restart unless there were guarantees it could win business from the free american gps . " there is a doubt over the revenues , " an unnamed executive told the paper .
" why sell pepsi-cola when you can get coca-cola free ? " while it is difficult to see what real alternatives to the big eight barrot has , the commissioner said he wanted to set a may 10 deadline for the companies to act , and expects to receive a mandate to make such a demand next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is n't alone in developing a satellite navigation system he said he would review the companies ' reactions and recommend how the project should proceed to eu transport minister in june . competition moving forward in contrast to gps , which is run by the us defence department , galileo will be used for civilian purposes only . the european satellite navigation system will monitor natural disasters , in air and sea rescue services and a range of commercial uses , including possibly road safety and pricing . the eu fears that china could launch a competitor before galileo is fully operational .

diane and gareth have always been honest and fair with me " donna bishop " donna was clearly a natural , caring mum but she was very suspicious of us and anyone in a position of authority .
" she had been through a very difficult period but over time we were able to establish a good relationship with her based on trust and mutual respect .
" it 's incredible to think that was seven years ago and both donna and jordan are still with us .
" foster children normally leave their carers when they reach the age of 18 but we 're delighted that donna and jordan are still part of our family , we would n't have it any other way , " she added .

mrs williams , from pontypool , is a specialist carer who fosters young mothers and their babies .

mrs williams who has cared for four young mothers and their five children said : " i can remember the first day they came to stay with us .
diane and gareth have always been honest and fair with me donna bishop " donna was clearly a natural , caring mum but she was very suspicious of us and anyone in a position of authority .
" she had been through a very difficult period but over time we were able to establish a good relationship with her based on trust and mutual respect .
" it 's incredible to think that was seven years ago and both donna and jordan are still with us .
" foster children normally leave their carers when they reach the age of 18 but we 're delighted that donna and jordan are still part of our family , we would n't have it any other way , " she added .
donna , who was originally from merthyr tydfil , said : " at first i was over-protective of jordan and did n't want anybody to tell me how to look after him .

incredibly supportive donna has worked hard while caring for jordan and is currently studying at college for a qualification in child care .
one day she hopes to become a foster carer herself .

a study suggests the smallest particles in lunar dust might be toxic , if comparisons with dust inhalation cases on earth apply .
teams hope to carry out experiments on mice to determine whether this is the case or not .
nasa has set up a working group to look into the matter ahead of its planned return to the moon by 2020 .
a team at the university of tennessee -lrb- ut -rrb- in knoxville is also looking at ways of using magnets to filter dust from the living environments of lunar bases and spacecraft .
see how the us plans to return to the moon in 2020 the health effects of inhaling lunar dust have been recognised since nasa 's apollo missions .
astronaut harrison h -lrb- jack -rrb- schmitt , the last man to step on to the moon in apollo 17 , complained of " lunar dust hay fever " when his dirty space suit contaminated the habitation module after an energetic foray on the lunar surface .
the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- is now keen to assess the effects of more prolonged exposure and to address the problem before humans are sent back to the moon in just over a decade .
details of the work were presented to the lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas .
' dangerous fraction ' nasa 's lunar airborne dust toxicity advisory group -lrb- ladtag -rrb- , which includes medical doctors as well as scientists from ut , have been working to characterise the dust 's properties .
lunar dust will be tested before humans set foot on the moon again " i 've been working on lunar samples for 35 years and i have looked at fractions down to a few microns -lrb- millionths of a metre -rrb- , but never anything less , " said professor larry taylor , director of the planetary geosciences institute at tennessee .
" the medical doctors are interested in things that are less than about three microns .
" so we did some particle size determinations and discovered that a very large portion of lunar soil is potentially dangerous , approximately 1-3 % of the total soil by weight . "
most particles in lunar soil should get coughed up , or moved out of the lungs by specialised hairs called cilli .
but any particles smaller than about 2.5 microns will stick in lung tissue .
when dust is deposited in the lungs , inflammation occurs .
ultimately , scar tissue called a fibroid grows around the particle .
this scar tissue replaces cells which facilitate the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- in the lungs .
the magnetic properties of lunar dust could be useful this is the process at work in the condition silicosis - an occupational hazard in mining , quarrying and foundry work - and asbestosis , which results from inhaling asbestos fibres .
it also occurs in bronchitis and as a consequence of smoking .
" if you took a healthy pair of adult lungs and smeared them out , they would cover a football field , " professor taylor told bbc news .
" once you are down to the size of a square table 's worth of surface area in your lungs that is useable ; you are just about dead . "
fine particles the team at the university of tennessee has shown that about one percent by weight of lunar soil comprises particles less than one micron in size .
a smaller - but still significant - fraction is less than 100 nanometres -lrb- billionths of a metre -rrb- in size .
they determined that most of the fine particles in lunar dust are composed of glass formed through the impact of micrometeorites on the surface of the moon .
but the glass also contains metallic iron grains , much like that in a carpenter 's nail and measuring just 10-20 nanometres in size .
machines could be sent to the moon to " pave " its surface these grains , called " nano-phase iron " , are so small that , if inhaled , some would pass directly from the lungs into the blood circulation .
once in the blood , the iron could " de-energise " the haemoglobin molecule which carries oxygen to the body 's tissues .
if enough gets dissolved in the blood , it could produce effects similar to carbon monoxide poisoning .
however , exactly how much is required for this to happen remains an open question .
in addition , when some fine dust particles are examined under the microscope , they can be seen to be filled with holes - like swiss cheese .
these vesicles give them a much larger surface area to react with the lung tissue , says dr yang liu , a postdoctoral research associate at the university of tennessee .
" if you have a solid particle of dust and add vesicles , you can calculate how much the reactive surface area is increased .
sometimes you can get increases of up to a factor of five , " she told bbc news .
" with jagged particles , because of the way they follow the path of the air , there 's a lower chance of them impacting the sinus walls at the back of the throat - which is the body 's defence mechanism for keeping particles out of the lungs , " said dr benjamin eimer , another postdoctoral researcher at the university of tennessee .
lab tests previous in vitro experiments with rodents found little effect from the inhalation of samples of lunar soil of average grain size .
but larry taylor says that new experiments need to concentrate on the effects of breathing in the fine dust particles .
if they are going to do any work on the moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it dr benjamin eimer , university of tennessee however , the nano-phase iron could also be the key to mitigating the hazard , because it imparts magnetic properties to the dust .
virtually all particles smaller than about 50 microns are attracted by a simple hand-held magnet .
to demonstrate , professor taylor brought with him a vial of lunar dust returned from the moon in the 1969 apollo 11 mission .
sure enough , the dust was attracted to the magnet as he moved it around the plastic container .
" i discovered that if you put lunar soil in your microwave oven , next to your tea , it will melt at 1,200c before your tea boils - which is a magical thing , " he said .
this property is almost entirely due to a coupling effect between the microwaves and the nano-phase iron in the dust .
the molten dust from the microwave treatment hardens into solid glass , which has given rise to the idea that robots could be sent ahead of human missions to " pave " landing pads and roads by firing microwaves at the lunar soil .
see nasa 's moon base vision professor taylor has come up with a concept for a wheeled vehicle , much like an ice-rink resurfacer , that could perform the task , and has developed a prototype microwave device that could be carried to the moon .
paving the moon would prevent dust being kicked up by the manned spacecraft and vehicles which would follow to the surface , but some of the finest dust may be " levitated " electro-statically above the surface .
this is relevant not only for the health of the astronauts , but also for astronomy on the moon .
" if they are going to do any work on the moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it , " dr eimer told bbc news .
he has been working on ways to filter dust out of habitation modules and vacuum it up from the surface with devices that use magnets to attract the lunar soil and dust .
one concept , called the lunar air filter with a permanent magnet system -lrb- laf-pms -rrb- , consists of many permanent magnets placed with their magnetic poles very close , creating a large field gradient that attracts lunar dust particles from the air .
in order to clean the filters out , small blocks of iron are moved into the gaps between the magnets to close off the magnetic fields .
with the filter turned off , the dust can be wiped away .
another concept , called the lunar soil magnetic collector -lrb- lsmac -rrb- , comprises a series of wound magnetic coils arranged along a tube that could be turned on in sequence to effectively " suck up " lunar dust , giving the impression of the leaf-gathering machine used here on earth .
" we will want to collect the soil to extract oxygen and hydrogen and perhaps to use for building materials .
so we will have to collect massive amounts of lunar regolith .
our idea was to make something that could gather up the soil without creating a large dust cloud , " said dr eimer .

a study suggests the smallest particles in lunar dust might be toxic , if comparisons with dust inhalation cases on earth apply .
teams hope to carry out experiments on mice to determine whether this is the case or not .
nasa has set up a working group to look into the matter ahead of its planned return to the moon by 2020 .
a team at the university of tennessee -lrb- ut -rrb- in knoxville is also looking at ways of using magnets to filter dust from the living environments of lunar bases and spacecraft .
see how the us plans to return to the moon in 2020 the health effects of inhaling lunar dust have been recognised since nasa 's apollo missions .
astronaut harrison h -lrb- jack -rrb- schmitt , the last man to step on to the moon in apollo 17 , complained of " lunar dust hay fever " when his dirty space suit contaminated the habitation module after an energetic foray on the lunar surface .
the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- is now keen to assess the effects of more prolonged exposure and to address the problem before humans are sent back to the moon in just over a decade .
details of the work were presented to the lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas .
' dangerous fraction ' nasa 's lunar airborne dust toxicity advisory group -lrb- ladtag -rrb- , which includes medical doctors as well as scientists from ut , have been working to characterise the dust 's properties .
lunar dust will be tested before humans set foot on the moon again " i 've been working on lunar samples for 35 years and i have looked at fractions down to a few microns -lrb- millionths of a metre -rrb- , but never anything less , " said professor larry taylor , director of the planetary geosciences institute at tennessee .
" the medical doctors are interested in things that are less than about three microns .
" so we did some particle size determinations and discovered that a very large portion of lunar soil is potentially dangerous , approximately 1-3 % of the total soil by weight . "
most particles in lunar soil should get coughed up , or moved out of the lungs by specialised hairs called cilli .
but any particles smaller than about 2.5 microns will stick in lung tissue .
when dust is deposited in the lungs , inflammation occurs .
ultimately , scar tissue called a fibroid grows around the particle .
this scar tissue replaces cells which facilitate the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- in the lungs .
the magnetic properties of lunar dust could be useful this is the process at work in the condition silicosis - an occupational hazard in mining , quarrying and foundry work - and asbestosis , which results from inhaling asbestos fibres .
it also occurs in bronchitis and as a consequence of smoking .
" if you took a healthy pair of adult lungs and smeared them out , they would cover a football field , " professor taylor told bbc news .
" once you are down to the size of a square table 's worth of surface area in your lungs that is useable ; you are just about dead . "
fine particles the team at the university of tennessee has shown that about one percent by weight of lunar soil comprises particles less than one micron in size .
a smaller - but still significant - fraction is less than 100 nanometres -lrb- billionths of a metre -rrb- in size .
they determined that most of the fine particles in lunar dust are composed of glass formed through the impact of micrometeorites on the surface of the moon .
but the glass also contains metallic iron grains , much like that in a carpenter 's nail and measuring just 10-20 nanometres in size .
machines could be sent to the moon to " pave " its surface these grains , called " nano-phase iron " , are so small that , if inhaled , some would pass directly from the lungs into the blood circulation .
once in the blood , the iron could " de-energise " the haemoglobin molecule which carries oxygen to the body 's tissues .
if enough gets dissolved in the blood , it could produce effects similar to carbon monoxide poisoning .
however , exactly how much is required for this to happen remains an open question .
in addition , when some fine dust particles are examined under the microscope , they can be seen to be filled with holes - like swiss cheese .
these vesicles give them a much larger surface area to react with the lung tissue , says dr yang liu , a postdoctoral research associate at the university of tennessee .
" if you have a solid particle of dust and add vesicles , you can calculate how much the reactive surface area is increased .
sometimes you can get increases of up to a factor of five , " she told bbc news .
" with jagged particles , because of the way they follow the path of the air , there 's a lower chance of them impacting the sinus walls at the back of the throat - which is the body 's defence mechanism for keeping particles out of the lungs , " said dr benjamin eimer , another postdoctoral researcher at the university of tennessee .
lab tests previous in vitro experiments with rodents found little effect from the inhalation of samples of lunar soil of average grain size .
but larry taylor says that new experiments need to concentrate on the effects of breathing in the fine dust particles .
if they are going to do any work on the moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it dr benjamin eimer , university of tennessee however , the nano-phase iron could also be the key to mitigating the hazard , because it imparts magnetic properties to the dust .
virtually all particles smaller than about 50 microns are attracted by a simple hand-held magnet .
to demonstrate , professor taylor brought with him a vial of lunar dust returned from the moon in the 1969 apollo 11 mission .
sure enough , the dust was attracted to the magnet as he moved it around the plastic container .
" i discovered that if you put lunar soil in your microwave oven , next to your tea , it will melt at 1,200c before your tea boils - which is a magical thing , " he said .
this property is almost entirely due to a coupling effect between the microwaves and the nano-phase iron in the dust .
the molten dust from the microwave treatment hardens into solid glass , which has given rise to the idea that robots could be sent ahead of human missions to " pave " landing pads and roads by firing microwaves at the lunar soil .
see nasa 's moon base vision professor taylor has come up with a concept for a wheeled vehicle , much like an ice-rink resurfacer , that could perform the task , and has developed a prototype microwave device that could be carried to the moon .
paving the moon would prevent dust being kicked up by the manned spacecraft and vehicles which would follow to the surface , but some of the finest dust may be " levitated " electro-statically above the surface .
this is relevant not only for the health of the astronauts , but also for astronomy on the moon .
" if they are going to do any work on the moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it , " dr eimer told bbc news .
he has been working on ways to filter dust out of habitation modules and vacuum it up from the surface with devices that use magnets to attract the lunar soil and dust .
one concept , called the lunar air filter with a permanent magnet system -lrb- laf-pms -rrb- , consists of many permanent magnets placed with their magnetic poles very close , creating a large field gradient that attracts lunar dust particles from the air .
in order to clean the filters out , small blocks of iron are moved into the gaps between the magnets to close off the magnetic fields .
with the filter turned off , the dust can be wiped away .
another concept , called the lunar soil magnetic collector -lrb- lsmac -rrb- , comprises a series of wound magnetic coils arranged along a tube that could be turned on in sequence to effectively " suck up " lunar dust , giving the impression of the leaf-gathering machine used here on earth .
" we will want to collect the soil to extract oxygen and hydrogen and perhaps to use for building materials .
so we will have to collect massive amounts of lunar regolith .
our idea was to make something that could gather up the soil without creating a large dust cloud , " said dr eimer .

a study suggests the smallest particles in lunar dust might be toxic , if comparisons with dust inhalation cases on earth apply .
teams hope to carry out experiments on mice to determine whether this is the case or not .
nasa has set up a working group to look into the matter ahead of its planned return to the moon by 2020 .
a team at the university of tennessee -lrb- ut -rrb- in knoxville is also looking at ways of using magnets to filter dust from the living environments of lunar bases and spacecraft .
the health effects of inhaling lunar dust have been recognised since nasa 's apollo missions .
astronaut harrison h -lrb- jack -rrb- schmitt , the last man to step on to the moon in apollo 17 , complained of " lunar dust hay fever " when his dirty space suit contaminated the habitation module after an energetic foray on the lunar surface .
the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- is now keen to assess the effects of more prolonged exposure and to address the problem before humans are sent back to the moon in just over a decade .
details of the work were presented to the lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas .
' dangerous fraction ' nasa 's lunar airborne dust toxicity advisory group -lrb- ladtag -rrb- , which includes medical doctors as well as scientists from ut , have been working to characterise the dust 's properties .
" i 've been working on lunar samples for 35 years and i have looked at fractions down to a few microns -lrb- millionths of a metre -rrb- , but never anything less , " said professor larry taylor , director of the planetary geosciences institute at tennessee .
" the medical doctors are interested in things that are less than about three microns .
" so we did some particle size determinations and discovered that a very large portion of lunar soil is potentially dangerous , approximately 1-3 % of the total soil by weight . "
most particles in lunar soil should get coughed up , or moved out of the lungs by specialised hairs called cilli .
but any particles smaller than about 2.5 microns will stick in lung tissue .
when dust is deposited in the lungs , inflammation occurs .
ultimately , scar tissue called a fibroid grows around the particle .
this scar tissue replaces cells which facilitate the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- in the lungs .
this is the process at work in the condition silicosis - an occupational hazard in mining , quarrying and foundry work - and asbestosis , which results from inhaling asbestos fibres .
it also occurs in bronchitis and as a consequence of smoking .
" if you took a healthy pair of adult lungs and smeared them out , they would cover a football field , " professor taylor told bbc news .
" once you are down to the size of a square table 's worth of surface area in your lungs that is useable ; you are just about dead . "
fine particles the team at the university of tennessee has shown that about one percent by weight of lunar soil comprises particles less than one micron in size .
a smaller - but still significant - fraction is less than 100 nanometres -lrb- billionths of a metre -rrb- in size .
they determined that most of the fine particles in lunar dust are composed of glass formed through the impact of micrometeorites on the surface of the moon .
but the glass also contains metallic iron grains , much like that in a carpenter 's nail and measuring just 10-20 nanometres in size .
these grains , called " nano-phase iron " , are so small that , if inhaled , some would pass directly from the lungs into the blood circulation .
once in the blood , the iron could " de-energise " the haemoglobin molecule which carries oxygen to the body 's tissues .
if enough gets dissolved in the blood , it could produce effects similar to carbon monoxide poisoning .
however , exactly how much is required for this to happen remains an open question .
in addition , when some fine dust particles are examined under the microscope , they can be seen to be filled with holes - like swiss cheese .
these vesicles give them a much larger surface area to react with the lung tissue , says dr yang liu , a postdoctoral research associate at the university of tennessee .
" if you have a solid particle of dust and add vesicles , you can calculate how much the reactive surface area is increased .
sometimes you can get increases of up to a factor of five , " she told bbc news .
" with jagged particles , because of the way they follow the path of the air , there 's a lower chance of them impacting the sinus walls at the back of the throat - which is the body 's defence mechanism for keeping particles out of the lungs , " said dr benjamin eimer , another postdoctoral researcher at the university of tennessee .
lab tests previous in vitro experiments with rodents found little effect from the inhalation of samples of lunar soil of average grain size .
but larry taylor says that new experiments need to concentrate on the effects of breathing in the fine dust particles . "
if they are going to do any work on the moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it " dr benjamin eimer , university of tennessee however , the nano-phase iron could also be the key to mitigating the hazard , because it imparts magnetic properties to the dust .
virtually all particles smaller than about 50 microns are attracted by a simple hand-held magnet .
to demonstrate , professor taylor brought with him a vial of lunar dust returned from the moon in the 1969 apollo 11 mission .
sure enough , the dust was attracted to the magnet as he moved it around the plastic container .
" i discovered that if you put lunar soil in your microwave oven , next to your tea , it will melt at 1,200c before your tea boils - which is a magical thing , " he said .
this property is almost entirely due to a coupling effect between the microwaves and the nano-phase iron in the dust .
the molten dust from the microwave treatment hardens into solid glass , which has given rise to the idea that robots could be sent ahead of human missions to " pave " landing pads and roads by firing microwaves at the lunar soil .
see nasa 's moon base vision professor taylor has come up with a concept for a wheeled vehicle , much like an ice-rink resurfacer , that could perform the task , and has developed a prototype microwave device that could be carried to the moon .
paving the moon would prevent dust being kicked up by the manned spacecraft and vehicles which would follow to the surface , but some of the finest dust may be " levitated " electro-statically above the surface .
this is relevant not only for the health of the astronauts , but also for astronomy on the moon .
" if they are going to do any work on the moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it , " dr eimer told bbc news .
he has been working on ways to filter dust out of habitation modules and vacuum it up from the surface with devices that use magnets to attract the lunar soil and dust .
one concept , called the lunar air filter with a permanent magnet system -lrb- laf-pms -rrb- , consists of many permanent magnets placed with their magnetic poles very close , creating a large field gradient that attracts lunar dust particles from the air .
in order to clean the filters out , small blocks of iron are moved into the gaps between the magnets to close off the magnetic fields .
with the filter turned off , the dust can be wiped away .
another concept , called the lunar soil magnetic collector -lrb- lsmac -rrb- , comprises a series of wound magnetic coils arranged along a tube that could be turned on in sequence to effectively " suck up " lunar dust , giving the impression of the leaf-gathering machine used here on earth .
" we will want to collect the soil to extract oxygen and hydrogen and perhaps to use for building materials .
so we will have to collect massive amounts of lunar regolith .
our idea was to make something that could gather up the soil without creating a large dust cloud , " said dr eimer .
