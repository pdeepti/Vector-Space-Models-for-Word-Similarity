consumers today are mostly concerned about their diet , the safety and quality of food , and product diversity , according to jürgen fröhling .
the director of the german association of sustainable agriculture says transparency is important after recent food scandals . " i believe how quality control is being carried out is very important in getting the confidence in the production process from the stable to the shelf of the supermarket , " fröhling said . great interest , therefore , is expected in the organic processes and companies on show in berlin .
in germany , the demand for organic food has outgrown supplies .

the eu has become the world 's leading exporter of agricultural produce , now valued at nearly 60 billion euros . however , as a consequence of economic liberalization , it has also become the world 's largest importer .
and so , the green week is an important marketing instrument for countries of central and eastern europe . for the expected 100,000 trade visitors , some 250 exhibits not only focus on agricultural policy and reducing bureaucracy , they also pick up on debates about the health of livestock , the future of disease control - and also a very different task to occupy farmers . farmers ' role in energy efficiency in addition to producing food and caring for the countryside , german farmers are firmly established as commercial energy producers .
they are already the sector leaders in producing bio-energy and renewable raw materials . " we want europe to lead the way in climate protection , energy efficiency and in the development of new products , " said german chancellor angela merkel .
" renewable bio-energy will help us to discover new products which we can then export . " germany 's agriculture business is a confident one .
the country 's national association of the german food industry estimates last year 's turnover at 138.6 billion euros .
as a result of economic growth in eastern europe as well as increased prosperity in populous asian countries , the association predicts the world demand for food will increase even further . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green week reaps rich harvest as it turns 80 what began 80 years ago as a goods exchange , has today turned into the " green week " - the world 's most important food and agriculture fair in berlin .

the convention , the largest of its kind , will be paying particular attention to food safety , trade ties and energy . agribusiness - the term for agriculture and the food industry , together with their suppliers and the sectors they in turn supply - is germany 's fourth largest branch of industry .
its turnover amounted to some 553 billion euros -lrb- $ 691.7 billion -rrb- in 2006 , providing employment for some 4.3 million people and making germany the world 's fourth largest exporter and second largest importer of agricultural produce . the international green week in berlin - the world 's largest consumer show for agriculture , food and horticulture which runs from january 19-28 - therefore draws a strong attendance made up of exhibitors from 56 countries , trade visitors and consumers . but it 's not all business .
on arrival at the green week show , city-dwellers are transported to a countryside of blooming plants and flowers while still in the confines of germany 's wintry capital .
and with the world 's most diverse range of foods and beverages on site , the green week is also a gourmet 's delight . for 10 days , it extends an invitation to explore delicacies from 56 countries .
reindeer meat is making its first appearance this year while latvia is presenting quail 's eggs .
consumers can wash the international cuisine down with everything from australian beer to whiskey from brandenburg . food quality and organic processes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the global menu on hand would make any mouth water , visitors are expected to investigate the healthy as well as tasty options .
consumers today are mostly concerned about their diet , the safety and quality of food , and product diversity , according to jürgen fröhling .
the director of the german association of sustainable agriculture says transparency is important after recent food scandals . " i believe how quality control is being carried out is very important in getting the confidence in the production process from the stable to the shelf of the supermarket , " fröhling said . great interest , therefore , is expected in the organic processes and companies on show in berlin .
in germany , the demand for organic food has outgrown supplies .
imports fill the gap as farmers need a three year transition period to change to organic production methods . eu export and import emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are flocking to berlin to promote their wares coming as it does in the infancy of germany 's six month eu-presidency , the world 's largest agricultural show focuses on the european union .
only portugal , malta and sweden are not represented at the show .
the eu has become the world 's leading exporter of agricultural produce , now valued at nearly 60 billion euros . however , as a consequence of economic liberalization , it has also become the world 's largest importer .
and so , the green week is an important marketing instrument for countries of central and eastern europe . for the expected 100,000 trade visitors , some 250 exhibits not only focus on agricultural policy and reducing bureaucracy , they also pick up on debates about the health of livestock , the future of disease control - and also a very different task to occupy farmers . farmers ' role in energy efficiency in addition to producing food and caring for the countryside , german farmers are firmly established as commercial energy producers .
they are already the sector leaders in producing bio-energy and renewable raw materials . " we want europe to lead the way in climate protection , energy efficiency and in the development of new products , " said german chancellor angela merkel .
" renewable bio-energy will help us to discover new products which we can then export . " germany 's agriculture business is a confident one .
the country 's national association of the german food industry estimates last year 's turnover at 138.6 billion euros .
as a result of economic growth in eastern europe as well as increased prosperity in populous asian countries , the association predicts the world demand for food will increase even further . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green week reaps rich harvest as it turns 80 what began 80 years ago as a goods exchange , has today turned into the " green week " - the world 's most important food and agriculture fair in berlin .

but they had no popular support . west germany preserved democracy and gradually caught most of the middle-class terrorists .
leaders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicide in jail in 1976 and 1977 . longest interred raf members seek freedom mohnhaupt and klar have served longer terms in custody than any other former raf terrorists and are among only four still serving out jail terms .
the rest have been gradually paroled and are living out unremarkable lives in german cities . a panel of state superior court judges is set to give mohnhaupt a hearing on jan .

in 1993 , mohnhaupt sent a statement from jail opposing an raf surrender . prison officials say mohnhaupt has been well-behaved in the prison in bavaria where she is serving time , with no sign of any new plots . klar 's plea likely to go unheard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar 's bid for clemency is unlikely to succeed according to the newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung this week , klar has applied to german president horst köhler for clemency , as he would not qualify for another two years to apply for parole .
he must serve a minimum 26 years .
the paper said there were signs were that clemency might be granted . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before diverting into terrorism , is reported to have been well behaved in jail . a berlin theater has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

"
the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .

but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .

but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .

but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .

but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

"
the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .

it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .

"
the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .

"
the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .

but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

the convention , the largest of its kind , will be paying particular attention to food safety , trade ties and energy . agribusiness - the term for agriculture and the food industry , together with their suppliers and the sectors they in turn supply - is germany 's fourth largest branch of industry .
its turnover amounted to some 553 billion euros -lrb- $ 691.7 billion -rrb- in 2006 , providing employment for some 4.3 million people and making germany the world 's fourth largest exporter and second largest importer of agricultural produce . the international green week in berlin - the world 's largest consumer show for agriculture , food and horticulture which runs from january 19-28 - therefore draws a strong attendance made up of exhibitors from 56 countries , trade visitors and consumers . but it 's not all business .
on arrival at the green week show , city-dwellers are transported to a countryside of blooming plants and flowers while still in the confines of germany 's wintry capital .
and with the world 's most diverse range of foods and beverages on site , the green week is also a gourmet 's delight . for 10 days , it extends an invitation to explore delicacies from 56 countries .
reindeer meat is making its first appearance this year while latvia is presenting quail 's eggs .
consumers can wash the international cuisine down with everything from australian beer to whiskey from brandenburg . food quality and organic processes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the global menu on hand would make any mouth water , visitors are expected to investigate the healthy as well as tasty options .
consumers today are mostly concerned about their diet , the safety and quality of food , and product diversity , according to jürgen fröhling .
the director of the german association of sustainable agriculture says transparency is important after recent food scandals . " i believe how quality control is being carried out is very important in getting the confidence in the production process from the stable to the shelf of the supermarket , " fröhling said . great interest , therefore , is expected in the organic processes and companies on show in berlin .
in germany , the demand for organic food has outgrown supplies .
imports fill the gap as farmers need a three year transition period to change to organic production methods . eu export and import emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are flocking to berlin to promote their wares coming as it does in the infancy of germany 's six month eu-presidency , the world 's largest agricultural show focuses on the european union .
only portugal , malta and sweden are not represented at the show .
the eu has become the world 's leading exporter of agricultural produce , now valued at nearly 60 billion euros . however , as a consequence of economic liberalization , it has also become the world 's largest importer .
and so , the green week is an important marketing instrument for countries of central and eastern europe . for the expected 100,000 trade visitors , some 250 exhibits not only focus on agricultural policy and reducing bureaucracy , they also pick up on debates about the health of livestock , the future of disease control - and also a very different task to occupy farmers . farmers ' role in energy efficiency in addition to producing food and caring for the countryside , german farmers are firmly established as commercial energy producers .
they are already the sector leaders in producing bio-energy and renewable raw materials . " we want europe to lead the way in climate protection , energy efficiency and in the development of new products , " said german chancellor angela merkel .
" renewable bio-energy will help us to discover new products which we can then export . " germany 's agriculture business is a confident one .
the country 's national association of the german food industry estimates last year 's turnover at 138.6 billion euros .
as a result of economic growth in eastern europe as well as increased prosperity in populous asian countries , the association predicts the world demand for food will increase even further . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green week reaps rich harvest as it turns 80 what began 80 years ago as a goods exchange , has today turned into the " green week " - the world 's most important food and agriculture fair in berlin .

the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .

it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .

"
the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 19.01.2007 green week opens with emphasis on agribusiness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best and wurst : the green week show offers cuisine from all around the world berlin hosts the green week 2007 agriculture show which this year focuses on international agribusiness .
the convention , the largest of its kind , will be paying particular attention to food safety , trade ties and energy . agribusiness - the term for agriculture and the food industry , together with their suppliers and the sectors they in turn supply - is germany 's fourth largest branch of industry .
its turnover amounted to some 553 billion euros -lrb- $ 691.7 billion -rrb- in 2006 , providing employment for some 4.3 million people and making germany the world 's fourth largest exporter and second largest importer of agricultural produce . the international green week in berlin - the world 's largest consumer show for agriculture , food and horticulture which runs from january 19-28 - therefore draws a strong attendance made up of exhibitors from 56 countries , trade visitors and consumers . but it 's not all business .
on arrival at the green week show , city-dwellers are transported to a countryside of blooming plants and flowers while still in the confines of germany 's wintry capital .
and with the world 's most diverse range of foods and beverages on site , the green week is also a gourmet 's delight . for 10 days , it extends an invitation to explore delicacies from 56 countries .
reindeer meat is making its first appearance this year while latvia is presenting quail 's eggs .
consumers can wash the international cuisine down with everything from australian beer to whiskey from brandenburg . food quality and organic processes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the global menu on hand would make any mouth water , visitors are expected to investigate the healthy as well as tasty options .
consumers today are mostly concerned about their diet , the safety and quality of food , and product diversity , according to jürgen fröhling .
the director of the german association of sustainable agriculture says transparency is important after recent food scandals . " i believe how quality control is being carried out is very important in getting the confidence in the production process from the stable to the shelf of the supermarket , " fröhling said . great interest , therefore , is expected in the organic processes and companies on show in berlin .
in germany , the demand for organic food has outgrown supplies .
imports fill the gap as farmers need a three year transition period to change to organic production methods . eu export and import emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are flocking to berlin to promote their wares coming as it does in the infancy of germany 's six month eu-presidency , the world 's largest agricultural show focuses on the european union .
only portugal , malta and sweden are not represented at the show .
the eu has become the world 's leading exporter of agricultural produce , now valued at nearly 60 billion euros . however , as a consequence of economic liberalization , it has also become the world 's largest importer .
and so , the green week is an important marketing instrument for countries of central and eastern europe . for the expected 100,000 trade visitors , some 250 exhibits not only focus on agricultural policy and reducing bureaucracy , they also pick up on debates about the health of livestock , the future of disease control - and also a very different task to occupy farmers . farmers ' role in energy efficiency in addition to producing food and caring for the countryside , german farmers are firmly established as commercial energy producers .
they are already the sector leaders in producing bio-energy and renewable raw materials . " we want europe to lead the way in climate protection , energy efficiency and in the development of new products , " said german chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .

german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

on the contrary , it should be planning to build more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

the convention , the largest of its kind , will be paying particular attention to food safety , trade ties and energy . agribusiness - the term for agriculture and the food industry , together with their suppliers and the sectors they in turn supply - is germany 's fourth largest branch of industry .
its turnover amounted to some 553 billion euros -lrb- $ 691.7 billion -rrb- in 2006 , providing employment for some 4.3 million people and making germany the world 's fourth largest exporter and second largest importer of agricultural produce . the international green week in berlin - the world 's largest consumer show for agriculture , food and horticulture which runs from january 19-28 - therefore draws a strong attendance made up of exhibitors from 56 countries , trade visitors and consumers . but it 's not all business .
on arrival at the green week show , city-dwellers are transported to a countryside of blooming plants and flowers while still in the confines of germany 's wintry capital .
and with the world 's most diverse range of foods and beverages on site , the green week is also a gourmet 's delight . for 10 days , it extends an invitation to explore delicacies from 56 countries .
reindeer meat is making its first appearance this year while latvia is presenting quail 's eggs .
consumers can wash the international cuisine down with everything from australian beer to whiskey from brandenburg . food quality and organic processes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the global menu on hand would make any mouth water , visitors are expected to investigate the healthy as well as tasty options .
consumers today are mostly concerned about their diet , the safety and quality of food , and product diversity , according to jürgen fröhling .
the director of the german association of sustainable agriculture says transparency is important after recent food scandals . " i believe how quality control is being carried out is very important in getting the confidence in the production process from the stable to the shelf of the supermarket , " fröhling said . great interest , therefore , is expected in the organic processes and companies on show in berlin .
in germany , the demand for organic food has outgrown supplies .
imports fill the gap as farmers need a three year transition period to change to organic production methods . eu export and import emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are flocking to berlin to promote their wares coming as it does in the infancy of germany 's six month eu-presidency , the world 's largest agricultural show focuses on the european union .
only portugal , malta and sweden are not represented at the show .
the eu has become the world 's leading exporter of agricultural produce , now valued at nearly 60 billion euros . however , as a consequence of economic liberalization , it has also become the world 's largest importer .
and so , the green week is an important marketing instrument for countries of central and eastern europe . for the expected 100,000 trade visitors , some 250 exhibits not only focus on agricultural policy and reducing bureaucracy , they also pick up on debates about the health of livestock , the future of disease control - and also a very different task to occupy farmers . farmers ' role in energy efficiency in addition to producing food and caring for the countryside , german farmers are firmly established as commercial energy producers .
they are already the sector leaders in producing bio-energy and renewable raw materials . " we want europe to lead the way in climate protection , energy efficiency and in the development of new products , " said german chancellor angela merkel .
" renewable bio-energy will help us to discover new products which we can then export . " germany 's agriculture business is a confident one .

the convention , the largest of its kind , will be paying particular attention to food safety , trade ties and energy . agribusiness - the term for agriculture and the food industry , together with their suppliers and the sectors they in turn supply - is germany 's fourth largest branch of industry .
its turnover amounted to some 553 billion euros -lrb- $ 691.7 billion -rrb- in 2006 , providing employment for some 4.3 million people and making germany the world 's fourth largest exporter and second largest importer of agricultural produce . the international green week in berlin - the world 's largest consumer show for agriculture , food and horticulture which runs from january 19-28 - therefore draws a strong attendance made up of exhibitors from 56 countries , trade visitors and consumers . but it 's not all business .
on arrival at the green week show , city-dwellers are transported to a countryside of blooming plants and flowers while still in the confines of germany 's wintry capital .
and with the world 's most diverse range of foods and beverages on site , the green week is also a gourmet 's delight . for 10 days , it extends an invitation to explore delicacies from 56 countries .
reindeer meat is making its first appearance this year while latvia is presenting quail 's eggs .
consumers can wash the international cuisine down with everything from australian beer to whiskey from brandenburg . food quality and organic processes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the global menu on hand would make any mouth water , visitors are expected to investigate the healthy as well as tasty options .
consumers today are mostly concerned about their diet , the safety and quality of food , and product diversity , according to jürgen fröhling .
the director of the german association of sustainable agriculture says transparency is important after recent food scandals . " i believe how quality control is being carried out is very important in getting the confidence in the production process from the stable to the shelf of the supermarket , " fröhling said . great interest , therefore , is expected in the organic processes and companies on show in berlin .
in germany , the demand for organic food has outgrown supplies .
imports fill the gap as farmers need a three year transition period to change to organic production methods . eu export and import emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are flocking to berlin to promote their wares coming as it does in the infancy of germany 's six month eu-presidency , the world 's largest agricultural show focuses on the european union .
only portugal , malta and sweden are not represented at the show .
the eu has become the world 's leading exporter of agricultural produce , now valued at nearly 60 billion euros . however , as a consequence of economic liberalization , it has also become the world 's largest importer .
and so , the green week is an important marketing instrument for countries of central and eastern europe . for the expected 100,000 trade visitors , some 250 exhibits not only focus on agricultural policy and reducing bureaucracy , they also pick up on debates about the health of livestock , the future of disease control - and also a very different task to occupy farmers . farmers ' role in energy efficiency in addition to producing food and caring for the countryside , german farmers are firmly established as commercial energy producers .
they are already the sector leaders in producing bio-energy and renewable raw materials . " we want europe to lead the way in climate protection , energy efficiency and in the development of new products , " said german chancellor angela merkel .
" renewable bio-energy will help us to discover new products which we can then export . " germany 's agriculture business is a confident one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .

but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .

the convention , the largest of its kind , will be paying particular attention to food safety , trade ties and energy . agribusiness - the term for agriculture and the food industry , together with their suppliers and the sectors they in turn supply - is germany 's fourth largest branch of industry .
its turnover amounted to some 553 billion euros -lrb- $ 691.7 billion -rrb- in 2006 , providing employment for some 4.3 million people and making germany the world 's fourth largest exporter and second largest importer of agricultural produce . the international green week in berlin - the world 's largest consumer show for agriculture , food and horticulture which runs from january 19-28 - therefore draws a strong attendance made up of exhibitors from 56 countries , trade visitors and consumers . but it 's not all business .
on arrival at the green week show , city-dwellers are transported to a countryside of blooming plants and flowers while still in the confines of germany 's wintry capital .
and with the world 's most diverse range of foods and beverages on site , the green week is also a gourmet 's delight . for 10 days , it extends an invitation to explore delicacies from 56 countries .
reindeer meat is making its first appearance this year while latvia is presenting quail 's eggs .
consumers can wash the international cuisine down with everything from australian beer to whiskey from brandenburg . food quality and organic processes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the global menu on hand would make any mouth water , visitors are expected to investigate the healthy as well as tasty options .
consumers today are mostly concerned about their diet , the safety and quality of food , and product diversity , according to jürgen fröhling .
the director of the german association of sustainable agriculture says transparency is important after recent food scandals . " i believe how quality control is being carried out is very important in getting the confidence in the production process from the stable to the shelf of the supermarket , " fröhling said . great interest , therefore , is expected in the organic processes and companies on show in berlin .
in germany , the demand for organic food has outgrown supplies .
imports fill the gap as farmers need a three year transition period to change to organic production methods . eu export and import emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are flocking to berlin to promote their wares coming as it does in the infancy of germany 's six month eu-presidency , the world 's largest agricultural show focuses on the european union .
only portugal , malta and sweden are not represented at the show .
the eu has become the world 's leading exporter of agricultural produce , now valued at nearly 60 billion euros . however , as a consequence of economic liberalization , it has also become the world 's largest importer .
and so , the green week is an important marketing instrument for countries of central and eastern europe . for the expected 100,000 trade visitors , some 250 exhibits not only focus on agricultural policy and reducing bureaucracy , they also pick up on debates about the health of livestock , the future of disease control - and also a very different task to occupy farmers . farmers ' role in energy efficiency in addition to producing food and caring for the countryside , german farmers are firmly established as commercial energy producers .
they are already the sector leaders in producing bio-energy and renewable raw materials . " we want europe to lead the way in climate protection , energy efficiency and in the development of new products , " said german chancellor angela merkel .
" renewable bio-energy will help us to discover new products which we can then export . " germany 's agriculture business is a confident one .
the country 's national association of the german food industry estimates last year 's turnover at 138.6 billion euros .
as a result of economic growth in eastern europe as well as increased prosperity in populous asian countries , the association predicts the world demand for food will increase even further . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green week reaps rich harvest as it turns 80 what began 80 years ago as a goods exchange , has today turned into the " green week " - the world 's most important food and agriculture fair in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .

but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .

months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .

resources are limited and if we want to live in comfort , the population must be limited . - clifford thackwray nuclear energy is the alternative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 19.01.2007 hitler 's rant about a leasing contract a hit on youtube großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over paris hilton - hitler is the hottest thing on web 2.0 forget about the new film " mein führer . "
the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .

"
the most successful hitler parody on film is a short in which adolf moans about a dishonest car salesman .
it 's attracted more than half a million hits on youtube . the two-and-a-half-minute short was made by film student florian wittmann from the northern german city of bremen .
it marries footage of hitler delivering a speech from leni riefenstahl 's triumph of the will with the sound of a routine by german cabaret performer gerhard polt . the result is a film in which the führer appears to deliver a tirade , replete with all his characteristically hysterical gesturing , about how a car dealer swindled him into a costly leasing agreement for an auto he thought he was buying outright .
an enthusiastic german crowd applauds him as he works himself up into a petty bourgeois frenzy . watching adolf rant and rave is all the rage among german youtube users .
and wittmann 's film has drawn praise in high places as well - author henryk m. broder said viewers learned more about hitler 's true character from wittmann 's spoof than from most anti-fascist documentaries . but not everyone 's a fan .
polt 's publisher sued wittmann for breach of copyright , which ended up costing him 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,586 -rrb- in legal fees . in the end , " hitler 's leasing contract " was never graded because wittmann had to leave school - not because of controversy , but because he lacked the money to continue his studies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny .
-lrb- 11.01.2007 -rrb- hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 19.01.2007 germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ensure europe learns the lessons of history germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? to its long list of ambitious goals as eu president , germany recently added a controversial one that is set to spark debate across europe about whether governments can uphold freedom of expression on one hand and outlaw certain viewpoints at the same time .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said she would like to see holocaust denial - already a crime in some european countries - become punishable by up to three years in prison in all 27 of the bloc 's member states .
" we have always said that it should not still be acceptable in europe to say the holocaust never existed and that six million jews were never killed , " zypries said recently .
" i am optimistic that over the next six months we will manage to get a result , " she said .
germany 's timing could not be better given the recent formation in the european parliament of identity , sovereignty and tradition , a far-right group headed by mussolini 's grand-daughter alessandra and french national front leader jean-marie le pen .
the group 's founder , french politician bruno gollnisch , was found guilty this week of questioning the holocaust by a french court .
in its ruling the court said gollnisch had called into question the number of jews killed during world war two and whether gas chambers had been used to kill them .
the european commissioner for justice and home affairs , franco frattini , pledged immediate support for the german proposal .
" while preserving freedom of expression , we have to criminalize concrete incitement , " he said .
symbolic value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former birkenau nazi death camp in oswiecim , poland but that 's easier said than done .
when luxembourg tried a similar push two years ago , it was blocked by italy .
this time , opposition is expected to come from countries keen to protect civil liberties come what may - including britain and denmark .
but robert kahn , author of " holocaust denial and the law , " believes that freedom of speech would not be unduly restricted .
" laws against holocaust denial do not per se restrict free speech - rather they restrict a given type of speech , " he says .
" in this regard , the laws are no different from laws against obscenity , blasphemy or libel , " kahn said , pointing out that even the united states , often held up as a model of freedom of speech , banned cross-burning and the wearing of ku klux klan masks .
" a law against holocaust denial can be effective as a symbolic statement , even if it is rarely used , " he stressed .
" it would serve the important symbolic function of stating that society will not tolerate a return to nazi practices of mass murder . "
the specter of the past it is therefore not surprising that as kahn pointed out , " the measure would find support in the eu parliament more from countries with direct experience with a nazi past . "
and indeed , the nine european countries in which holocaust denial is already an offense include germany , austria , poland , belgium and france .
other countries might well insist this is a matter to be decided at a national level .
" i think this question should be up to each nation to settle according to its own democratic mechanisms and procedures , " said british member of the european parliament daniel hannan from the conservative european people 's party , who also sits on the parliament ’ s committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
" i see no reason to impose a decision from brussels . "
do bans work ?
hannan also doubts that a ban can even be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust denier , british author david irving " in britain , there is a consensus that a ban would be disproportionate , and would only serve to give additional publicity to holocaust deniers - indeed , it might confirm their view of themselves as persecuted martyrs , " he stressed .
" the historical evidence for the deportations and murders is overwhelming .
no one , looking at the facts , can be in doubt about the enormity of what happened .
so why create the impression that we have something to hide ? "
others point out that a ban often achieves the exact opposite by piquing interest in something considered strictly off-limits .
christoph kreutzmüller , a historian at berlin ’ s humboldt university said that one had only to take a closer look at most right-wing extremist propaganda to recognise its weakness .
" you only have to skim through mein kampf -lrb- the hitler autobiography -rrb- to realize what rubbish it is , " he said .
" but the fact that it is banned -lrb- in germany -rrb- will always make more people want to read it . "
action reconciliation service for peace is a german peace and volunteer service organization founded in the aftermath of world war ii to confront the legacy of the nazi regime .
according to its spokesman johannes zerger , it too has reservations about the efficacy of holocaust denial laws and would prefer to see right-wing extremism tackled at its roots .
" we would support it as part of wider governmental measures , " he said .
" but we attach greater significance to taking political steps to tackle the problem . "
the advantages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchenwald but according to imanuel baumann from the association that runs the site and museum of the former concentration camp in buchenwald , a holocaust denial law can serve an educational purpose .
" we would welcome this legislation , " he said .
" drawing attention to any dissemination of holocaust denial by criminalizing it can be useful .
it pinpoints areas we need to focus on - not just for the purposes of lawyers and educators , but for the general public . "
as robert kahn points out , it could also be used to get tough on right-wing extremists who currently use legal loopholes to get away with incitement to hate .
" europe-wide legislation would make it easier to prosecute neo-nazi groups who take advantage of gaps in the coverage of european hate speech laws , " he said .
the right to be insulting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the new law help contain neo-nazis ?
but with opinion divided on the viability of a holocaust denial law , it seems europe has yet to figure out how to reconcile the fight against racism with freedom of speech - and is still struggling to accept that a society that defends freedom of expression also has to tolerate views it doesn ’ t like .
the dilemma was catapulted back into the public consciousness over the last year after the publication in denmark of cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed , which drew accusations from the muslim world that the eu operates double standards in its attempts to protect religions from insult and injury .
months later , turkey leveled a similar accusation at france , after the national assembly passed a law making it a criminal offense to deny that the massacre of armenians by turks during world war i was a case of genocide .
however eager europe is to protect judeo-christian sensitivities , said ankara , it is far less interested in combating defamation of islam . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austrian court frees holocaust denier irving self-professed historian david irving has been released from prison in austria after winning an appeal against a three-year prison sentence for denying the holocaust .

the convention , the largest of its kind , will be paying particular attention to food safety , trade ties and energy . agribusiness - the term for agriculture and the food industry , together with their suppliers and the sectors they in turn supply - is germany 's fourth largest branch of industry .
its turnover amounted to some 553 billion euros -lrb- $ 691.7 billion -rrb- in 2006 , providing employment for some 4.3 million people and making germany the world 's fourth largest exporter and second largest importer of agricultural produce . the international green week in berlin - the world 's largest consumer show for agriculture , food and horticulture which runs from january 19-28 - therefore draws a strong attendance made up of exhibitors from 56 countries , trade visitors and consumers . but it 's not all business .

the academy award winner for her role in network in 1976 plays a one-armed detective called in over a murder at newbridge memorial hall .
she appears in flick with liz smith - nana from the bbc 's royle family - and leslie phillips of carry on fame .
filming is continuing over 10 days in pontypool and cardiff and locals have been invited to work as extras .
dunaway , now 66 , was one of the biggest movie attractions of the 1970s and 1980s , famed for appearances in films like bonnie and clyde - for which she won an oscar nomination - chinatown and the thomas crown affair .
it is understood she was drawn to the welsh project after seeing the script of cardiff-born david howard 's debut feature film .
the star apparently liked it so much she agreed to undertake the film at a lower rate than her normal fee of more than £ 1m .
in flick she plays detective lieutenant mckenzie called in to investigate a murder after a fight at the memo - the newbridge memorial hall - in the 1950s .
the murder victim - a local boy - is brought back to life in modern times and tries to find his teenage sweetheart , by then 65 .
the film has been backed by the welsh assembly government 's wales creative ip fund .
the £ 7m fund set up in april 2005 has already invested nearly £ 3m .
its first investment , big nothing , was partly shot on location in barry and was premiered in cardiff in november .
its release followed the end of filming on location at llandeilo , carmarthenshire , for nightwatching , the fund 's fifth completed investment , which stars martin freeman , of the bbc comedy the office .
' creative ' last month it also invested in a st asaph computer and video games software developer for a sequel to its million selling tt superbikes game .
flick 's production company monster films relocated to wales from london last year .
rik hall , of monster films , said the fund was a " great tool to stimulate the growth of the creative industries in wales . "
the production also has support from the film agency for wales , the arts council of wales lottery funds , as well as private backers .
welsh enterprise minister andrew davies said : " flick is just the latest example of a production taking advantage of the finance and facilities available in wales .
" we are showing the world how great our creative industry is and we can be justly proud . "
flick will be released worldwide later this year .

we put some of your questions to her .
why is there so much uncertainty in our local health economy as to which services will be reconfigured ?
this is creating blight for all nhs staff .
dr sarah dalton , from colchester , essex ms hewitt said : " we have got headlines about hospital closures when actually we have rebuilt or are rebuilding 70 new hospitals .
" this is not about closures and downgrading .
it is about saying as medicine changes the nhs has to change with it .
" it is about doing more day surgery which is better for patients , it is about putting more staff ... and money in the community -lsb- services -rsb- .
" it is about having more specialist services where they are needed . hospitals which have got the right specialist services in place 24 hours a day , seven days a week ready to give the operation which will save your life . "
why are so many cuts having to be made ?
ms hewitt said : " we have had a very difficult year financially .
we are now on track to get the nhs as a whole back in balance and i am absolutely confident that will be done by the end of march .
" but with the benefit of hindsight it is clear we should have started in putting in place much earlier a financial system that was not only fair but was absolutely transparent . "
how come however much you see handwash gels at the doors to wards you rarely see visitors and especially health professionals use them .
why is n't mrsa taken as seriously ?
amy butterfield , rotherham ms hewitt said : " we made mrsa a priority because we were not satisfied with the situation in too many hospitals with too many people getting mrsa .
" that is why we set the target we knew when we set it - halve the mrsa rate by 2008 - we knew that was a very challenging rate but we knew only by setting a target would we get the attention we need for it .
" until very recently hospitals were not publishing their mrsa rates .
we have shone a light on it . "
why , when it is called the national health service , is there still a postcode lottery for certain treatments ?
peter m , loughborough ms hewitt says : " ever since the nhs was created , doctors have made decisions about what patients get .
different doctors have made different decisions so it has not always been consistent across the country .
" what has happened more recently is that decisions which were hidden are being done in a much more transparent way .
" we set up the national institute for health and clinical excellence to get these decisions made in a much more consistent way and get rid of much of the postcode lottery which has actually been part of the nhs for nearly 60 years .
given the example of poor leadership , communication and negative " ca n't do " attitude shown by the management of rotherham general on the programme can gerry robinson fix the nhs , it is any wonder it is such a mess ?
anthony hopkins , from london ms hewitt said : " i think there are elements in the gerry robinson programme about rotherham that many people working in the nhs and being treated will recognise about the difficultly in changing any large organisation .

we put some of your questions to her .
why is there so much uncertainty in our local health economy as to which services will be reconfigured ?
this is creating blight for all nhs staff .
dr sarah dalton , from colchester , essex ms hewitt said : " we have got headlines about hospital closures when actually we have rebuilt or are rebuilding 70 new hospitals .
" this is not about closures and downgrading .
it is about saying as medicine changes the nhs has to change with it .
" it is about doing more day surgery which is better for patients , it is about putting more staff ... and money in the community -lsb- services -rsb- .
" it is about having more specialist services where they are needed . hospitals which have got the right specialist services in place 24 hours a day , seven days a week ready to give the operation which will save your life . "
why are so many cuts having to be made ?
ms hewitt said : " we have had a very difficult year financially .
we are now on track to get the nhs as a whole back in balance and i am absolutely confident that will be done by the end of march .
" but with the benefit of hindsight it is clear we should have started in putting in place much earlier a financial system that was not only fair but was absolutely transparent . "
how come however much you see handwash gels at the doors to wards you rarely see visitors and especially health professionals use them .
why is n't mrsa taken as seriously ?
amy butterfield , rotherham ms hewitt said : " we made mrsa a priority because we were not satisfied with the situation in too many hospitals with too many people getting mrsa .
" that is why we set the target we knew when we set it - halve the mrsa rate by 2008 - we knew that was a very challenging rate but we knew only by setting a target would we get the attention we need for it .
" until very recently hospitals were not publishing their mrsa rates .
we have shone a light on it . "
why , when it is called the national health service , is there still a postcode lottery for certain treatments ?
peter m , loughborough ms hewitt says : " ever since the nhs was created , doctors have made decisions about what patients get .
different doctors have made different decisions so it has not always been consistent across the country .
" what has happened more recently is that decisions which were hidden are being done in a much more transparent way .
" we set up the national institute for health and clinical excellence to get these decisions made in a much more consistent way and get rid of much of the postcode lottery which has actually been part of the nhs for nearly 60 years .
given the example of poor leadership , communication and negative " ca n't do " attitude shown by the management of rotherham general on the programme can gerry robinson fix the nhs , it is any wonder it is such a mess ?
anthony hopkins , from london ms hewitt said : " i think there are elements in the gerry robinson programme about rotherham that many people working in the nhs and being treated will recognise about the difficultly in changing any large organisation .
" but what was also quite noticeable was that it was often staff who were suggesting we need to change this .

we put some of your questions to her .
why is there so much uncertainty in our local health economy as to which services will be reconfigured ?
this is creating blight for all nhs staff .
dr sarah dalton , from colchester , essex ms hewitt said : " we have got headlines about hospital closures when actually we have rebuilt or are rebuilding 70 new hospitals .
" this is not about closures and downgrading .
it is about saying as medicine changes the nhs has to change with it .
" it is about doing more day surgery which is better for patients , it is about putting more staff ... and money in the community -lsb- services -rsb- .
" it is about having more specialist services where they are needed . hospitals which have got the right specialist services in place 24 hours a day , seven days a week ready to give the operation which will save your life . "
why are so many cuts having to be made ?
ms hewitt said : " we have had a very difficult year financially .
we are now on track to get the nhs as a whole back in balance and i am absolutely confident that will be done by the end of march .
" but with the benefit of hindsight it is clear we should have started in putting in place much earlier a financial system that was not only fair but was absolutely transparent . "
how come however much you see handwash gels at the doors to wards you rarely see visitors and especially health professionals use them .
why is n't mrsa taken as seriously ?
amy butterfield , rotherham ms hewitt said : " we made mrsa a priority because we were not satisfied with the situation in too many hospitals with too many people getting mrsa .
" that is why we set the target we knew when we set it - halve the mrsa rate by 2008 - we knew that was a very challenging rate but we knew only by setting a target would we get the attention we need for it .
" until very recently hospitals were not publishing their mrsa rates .
we have shone a light on it . "
why , when it is called the national health service , is there still a postcode lottery for certain treatments ?
peter m , loughborough ms hewitt says : " ever since the nhs was created , doctors have made decisions about what patients get .
different doctors have made different decisions so it has not always been consistent across the country .
" what has happened more recently is that decisions which were hidden are being done in a much more transparent way .
" we set up the national institute for health and clinical excellence to get these decisions made in a much more consistent way and get rid of much of the postcode lottery which has actually been part of the nhs for nearly 60 years .
given the example of poor leadership , communication and negative " ca n't do " attitude shown by the management of rotherham general on the programme can gerry robinson fix the nhs , it is any wonder it is such a mess ?
anthony hopkins , from london ms hewitt said : " i think there are elements in the gerry robinson programme about rotherham that many people working in the nhs and being treated will recognise about the difficultly in changing any large organisation .
" but what was also quite noticeable was that it was often staff who were suggesting we need to change this .

latest figures show the average gp income , net of expenses , was £ 106,000 in 2004-05 - a rise of 30 % in one year .
and reports have emerged that a small minority of family doctors are earning up to £ 250,000 .
now the health secretary patricia hewitt has said profits should have been capped .
why was a new contract brought in ?
it was becoming increasingly difficult to attract young doctors into general practice , and to encourage those already working in it to stay .
gps historically earned less than hospital doctors , and trainee medics were put off becoming a family doctor because of the perceived high workload and a responsibility for 24-hour cover .
the government agreed with the british medical association that a new contract was needed .
after detailed negotiations , the new contract was brought in between april and december 2004 .
what did it mean ?
for doctors , it meant two significant things .
they would no longer be responsible for providing care to the patients on their list 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
instead , they would be expected to work " office hours " , with local primary care organisations would be responsible for healthcare at night and at the weekend .
but more significantly , in regard to the nhs 's financial situation , the way gps were paid changed with around two thirds of their income being linked to whether they delivered quality services in certain areas .
these range from record keeping to meeting targets for providing a range of clinical services such as cholesterol checks and flu jabs .
how did this result in more pay ?
the targets are measured in points .
and points mean pounds .
in the area of raised blood pressure alone gp care under the new contract means that over a five year period , 8,700 patients in england will avoid having a heart attack , stroke , angina or heart failure hamish meldrum meeting a particular target equates to a certain number of points - which this year will be worth £ 124 each .
there is a total of around 1,000 points available .
when the contract was being negotiated , the government estimated gps would meet about 70 % of the target .
instead - and the bma says it warned of this - gps hit around 90 % .
this meant the gp contract cost the government £ 300m more than it budgeted for last year .
critics say this is partly responsible for the forecasted nhs deficit of between £ 600m and £ 800m for the last financial year .
is this because gps are all earning £ 250,000 ?
this kind of income is being brought in by a very small number of gps - one medical accountant estimated 10 out of his 600 clients were earning that kind of figure .
these are people who run what the bma describes as " big businesses " .
they are likely to run a network of surgeries , employing a number of salaried gps , nurses and other staff , and looking after around 40,000 patients .
but average gps ' earnings have risen sharply - latest figures suggesting a 30 % increase in the first year of the new contract .
are gps not simply being paid for what they should have been doing anyway ?
that is a criticism which has been made .
but the bma says , while some practices will always have been carrying out preventative checks such as cholesterol tests , the contract has meant more practices have been doing this kind of work to the level which is really needed .
have patients seen any benefits ?
the government says yes .
it says the contract has worked as part of its health improvement policy , helping ensure preventative measures such as health checks take place .
dr hamish meldrum , head of the bma 's gps committee , said the new contract was leading to improvements in care .
" in the area of raised blood pressure -lrb- hypertension -rrb- alone gp care under the new contract means that over a five year period , 8,700 patients in england will avoid having a heart attack , stroke , angina or heart failure . "
but patients ' groups complain that gps are too concerned with " ticking all the boxes " to earn money for extra checks that there is little time left for their current health problem .
and niall dickson , chief executive of the independent think-tank the king 's fund , say the contract has not increased gps ' productivity , and may actually have cut it because of the closure of saturday morning surgeries , and no responsibility for 24 hour cover .
what is the health secretary objecting to ?
ms hewitt is not saying gps should not have received a pay rise , that was always the intention to boost the number of doctors wanting to become family doctors .
instead , she believes gps should not be taking so much in profit as a proportion of the practice 's income .
gp surgeries effectively operate as a small business , with doctors having to pay staff and buy equipment from the funds a practice receive , or turnover in the business sense .
once all their expenses are paid , what they are left with is their income or profit .
in the year after the new contract was introduced , this rose by 5 % to 45 % as a proportion of turnover helping to drive gp pay up even further than it would have been .
the health secretary believes this would have been better spent on improving services to patients and said in hindsight she would have wished the government had introduced a limit so that they did not increase their profits in this way .
can anything be done about it ?
not really .
the contract has obviously been signed and sealed and doctors have always stated they are not going to take pay cuts .
however , for this financial year doctors did agree to a pay freeze , while accepting more challenging criteria for the performance-related pay aspect of their income .
doctors said they agreed to this as they wanted to " draw a line in the sand " over the issue of pay .

for doctors , it meant two significant things .
they would no longer be responsible for providing care to the patients on their list 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
instead , they would be expected to work " office hours " , with local primary care organisations would be responsible for healthcare at night and at the weekend .
but more significantly , in regard to the nhs 's financial situation , the way gps were paid changed with around two thirds of their income being linked to whether they delivered quality services in certain areas .
these range from record keeping to meeting targets for providing a range of clinical services such as cholesterol checks and flu jabs .
how did this result in more pay ?
the targets are measured in points .
and points mean pounds .
in the area of raised blood pressure alone gp care under the new contract means that over a five year period , 8,700 patients in england will avoid having a heart attack , stroke , angina or heart failure hamish meldrum meeting a particular target equates to a certain number of points - which this year will be worth £ 124 each .
there is a total of around 1,000 points available .
when the contract was being negotiated , the government estimated gps would meet about 70 % of the target .
instead - and the bma says it warned of this - gps hit around 90 % .
this meant the gp contract cost the government £ 300m more than it budgeted for last year .
critics say this is partly responsible for the forecasted nhs deficit of between £ 600m and £ 800m for the last financial year .
is this because gps are all earning £ 250,000 ?
this kind of income is being brought in by a very small number of gps - one medical accountant estimated 10 out of his 600 clients were earning that kind of figure .
these are people who run what the bma describes as " big businesses " .
they are likely to run a network of surgeries , employing a number of salaried gps , nurses and other staff , and looking after around 40,000 patients .
but average gps ' earnings have risen sharply - latest figures suggesting a 30 % increase in the first year of the new contract .
are gps not simply being paid for what they should have been doing anyway ?
that is a criticism which has been made .
but the bma says , while some practices will always have been carrying out preventative checks such as cholesterol tests , the contract has meant more practices have been doing this kind of work to the level which is really needed .
have patients seen any benefits ?
the government says yes .
it says the contract has worked as part of its health improvement policy , helping ensure preventative measures such as health checks take place .
dr hamish meldrum , head of the bma 's gps committee , said the new contract was leading to improvements in care .
" in the area of raised blood pressure -lrb- hypertension -rrb- alone gp care under the new contract means that over a five year period , 8,700 patients in england will avoid having a heart attack , stroke , angina or heart failure . "
but patients ' groups complain that gps are too concerned with " ticking all the boxes " to earn money for extra checks that there is little time left for their current health problem .
and niall dickson , chief executive of the independent think-tank the king 's fund , say the contract has not increased gps ' productivity , and may actually have cut it because of the closure of saturday morning surgeries , and no responsibility for 24 hour cover .
what is the health secretary objecting to ?
ms hewitt is not saying gps should not have received a pay rise , that was always the intention to boost the number of doctors wanting to become family doctors .
instead , she believes gps should not be taking so much in profit as a proportion of the practice 's income .
gp surgeries effectively operate as a small business , with doctors having to pay staff and buy equipment from the funds a practice receive , or turnover in the business sense .
once all their expenses are paid , what they are left with is their income or profit .
in the year after the new contract was introduced , this rose by 5 % to 45 % as a proportion of turnover helping to drive gp pay up even further than it would have been .
the health secretary believes this would have been better spent on improving services to patients and said in hindsight she would have wished the government had introduced a limit so that they did not increase their profits in this way .
can anything be done about it ?
not really .
the contract has obviously been signed and sealed and doctors have always stated they are not going to take pay cuts .
however , for this financial year doctors did agree to a pay freeze , while accepting more challenging criteria for the performance-related pay aspect of their income .
doctors said they agreed to this as they wanted to " draw a line in the sand " over the issue of pay .

why was a new contract brought in ?
it was becoming increasingly difficult to attract young doctors into general practice , and to encourage those already working in it to stay .

"
that 's one of shakespeare 's most famous quotations but could also be applied to oscar winner kevin spacey and theatre director ed hall who 're bringing two of the bard 's well-known plays to the west end stage .
twelfth night and the taming of the shrew are being staged at the old vic , and , just as in shakespeare 's time , they 'll be performed by an all-male cast .
we spoke to kevin spacey who has been artistic director for three years at the old vic , and edward hall , associate director of the old vic watch again from the link to the right of this page both of the productions have already been described by one critic as " a wicked pleasure " , and they are also performed with an all male cast in keeping with shakespeare 's original casting .
kevin spacey added that the plays deal with identity , disguise and deception , but that they are funny and accessible .
he added that although he was n't acting in any of the plays it was very satisfying to see shakespeare back at the old vic .
spacey said he would be acting again , in a play directed by trevor nunn , but not until 2008 , and he 's producing a film in the united states called 21 .
it 's about a group of students who learn to card count at blackjack , they go to las vegas and win millions of dollars .

the actor was speaking at the start of the sundance film festival in utah , where the opening movie recalled protests over the vietnam war in 1968 .
redford said he , like many others , had shown a " spirit of unity " with the us government after 11 september 2001 .
" we put all our concerns on hold to let the leaders lead , " he said .
" i think we 're owed a big , massive apology . "
the actor , whose sundance institute for independent film runs the annual festival , usually steers clear of political messages in his opening speech .
festival opener chicago 10 recounts the demonstrations surrounding 1968 's democratic national convention , which saw protestors clash with the national guard .
using a cutting-edge blend of historical footage and animation , director brett morgen 's film examines the trial of the famed " chicago seven , " who were convicted of inciting riots .
morgen , who took the stage to a standing ovation after the screening , said one of his goals in making the film was to " mobilise the youth in the country to get out and stop this war " .
his film is one of many referencing the iraq conflict at this year 's sundance festival .
ghosts of abu ghraib deals with the abuses that occurred in an iraqi prison in 2003 , while no end in sight is an examination of the bush administration 's conduct in the country .
taboos broken the programme for the festival has attracted controversy with the inclusion of films that include shocking sexual content .
a documentary called zoo deals with the practice of bestiality .
and the dark drama hounddog portrays the rape of a young girl , played by 12-year-old actress dakota fanning .
" those are issues that are on the table , whether you want to face them or not , " said redford .
" if you do n't expose these things , if you do n't put the light on them , then they could get worse . "
but the event also features many films with a more uplifting feel .
the good life , from writer and director steve berra , tells of a young man running an old cinema in a small town .
padre nuestro is about a young man who meets up with a group of illegal immigrants heading from mexico to new york after he chooses to flee his criminal past .
more than 120 films will be screened throughout the 10-day festival , which ends on 28 january .

by joe boyle bbc news a clash of cultures ?
big brother contestants have been accused of racism in their attacks on housemate shilpa shetty .
but when does ignorance end and racism begin ?
the treatment of bollywood actress shilpa shetty , a contestant on the channel 4 reality show , has attracted more than 30,000 complaints , caused a minor diplomatic incident and prompted the show 's sponsor carphone warehouse to pull out .
three of the contestants - danielle lloyd , jo o 'meara and jade goody - have been accused of bullying and making racist comments but friends of the three women , who are locked in the house , have said they are not racist people .
on thursday night , goody was challenged by big brother about calling shilpa " shilpa poppadom " .
she denied it was a racist comment and apologised for any offence .
even before this outburst , remarks such as " you do n't know where those hands have been " and shetty being told in foul language to " go home " were enough for some people to make up their minds that this was a row fuelled by shetty 's ethnicity .
giving her personal view of channel 4 's role as broadcaster , culture secretary tessa jowell said : " to make entertainment out of racism is disgusting . "
i think it would become racist if they were to be disparaging of shilpa shetty because of her being asian sunny hundal asians in media website row not racist , says shetty send us your comments yet shetty herself has told housemates she does not believe the attacks on her are racially motivated .
and among the thousands of viewers who have emailed the bbc website , many said they thought the comments - before jade made her poppadom remark - reflected ignorance rather than racism .
so where does one end and the other begin ?
in the eyes of the law , shetty would have a case to make under race legislation , says solicitor chris boothman , an expert on race law .
he believes the complaints are not yet serious enough to warrant a criminal prosecution , which requires harassment over a long period , but he believes shetty could have a case to pursue in the civil courts .
" if i was advising her i would advise to sue channel 4 under the race relations act .
" the major area of risk for channel 4 is that they have done little or nothing to intervene or try to stop this behaviour .
they have a responsibility to intervene . "
culture clash other leading lawyers have said shetty would also have a case to make under employment legislation , as a " worker " of channel 4 .
before goody made her remarks on thursday , channel 4 said there had been no overt racial abuse , and unambiguous racist behaviour would not be tolerated .
but many commentators believe race has played a part .
sarfraz manzoor , a british broadcaster of pakistani origin , says he initially believed it was a " clash of culture and a clash of class " but changed his mind after a few days of viewing .
" it 's too easy to say that if shilpa shetty was pink or blue or green she 'd be getting the same treatment - i do n't think that 's true . "
liz carnell of the bullying online charity says : " i do n't think that the remarks would have been made to someone from a white background .
i think they have been made because of her culture . "
the subject has gripped the media but what constitutes racism can be a matter of interpretation and others have been more cautious in their assessment .
before the language used in the big brother house escalated on thursday night , sunny hundal , who edits the asians in media website , offered some comfort to goody , saying he believed she had been misquoted .
" she is quoted as telling shilpa shetty to ' go back to the slums ' , referring to india as a slum .
i think she actually said ' go to the slums ' , referring to her own upbringing .
" of course , if she was referring to india as a slum , then that would certainly be a racial slur . "
but some viewers told the bbc goody had said " go back to the slums " on a separate occasion .
disparaging mr hundal said lloyd and o 'meara had made racist statements .
a short transcript of an exchange which features foul language appears below .
o 'meara declared indians were thin because they undercooked chicken .
and lloyd said shetty should " fuck off home " and could not speak english properly .
protests were sparked in india " i think it would become racist if they were to be disparaging of shilpa shetty because of her being asian or being indian or coming from a third world country , and saying ' you are indian therefore your are not as important ' .
that would be racist , " says mr hundal .
" jade has n't said anything along those lines .
but i believe the other two have . "
people in mumbai , shetty 's home city , were asked by bbc radio five live whether they thought she was a victim of racist bullying and some said they thought it nasty without being racist .
when goody was called into the house 's diary room to explain her latest comments , goody said : " she is indian so will have an indian name . "
shortly afterwards , shetty told housemates : " when i actually thought about it , i know it 's not a racist thing ... people say things in anger . "
she does not know all that has been said behind her back , but goody later told her she had called her " shilpa poppadom " and the two women hugged in a gesture which suggested a truce .

big brother contestants have been accused of racism in their attacks on housemate shilpa shetty .
but when does ignorance end and racism begin ?
the treatment of bollywood actress shilpa shetty , a contestant on the channel 4 reality show , has attracted more than 30,000 complaints , caused a minor diplomatic incident and prompted the show 's sponsor carphone warehouse to pull out .
three of the contestants - danielle lloyd , jo o 'meara and jade goody - have been accused of bullying and making racist comments but friends of the three women , who are locked in the house , have said they are not racist people .
on thursday night , goody was challenged by big brother about calling shilpa " shilpa poppadom " .
she denied it was a racist comment and apologised for any offence .
even before this outburst , remarks such as " you do n't know where those hands have been " and shetty being told in foul language to " go home " were enough for some people to make up their minds that this was a row fuelled by shetty 's ethnicity .
giving her personal view of channel 4 's role as broadcaster , culture secretary tessa jowell said : " to make entertainment out of racism is disgusting . "
i think it would become racist if they were to be disparaging of shilpa shetty because of her being asian sunny hundal asians in media website row not racist , says shetty send us your comments yet shetty herself has told housemates she does not believe the attacks on her are racially motivated .
and among the thousands of viewers who have emailed the bbc website , many said they thought the comments - before jade made her poppadom remark - reflected ignorance rather than racism .
so where does one end and the other begin ?
in the eyes of the law , shetty would have a case to make under race legislation , says solicitor chris boothman , an expert on race law .
he believes the complaints are not yet serious enough to warrant a criminal prosecution , which requires harassment over a long period , but he believes shetty could have a case to pursue in the civil courts .
