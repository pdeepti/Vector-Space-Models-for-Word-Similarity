kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .

he added that the 81-year-old economist would " provide ongoing advice and insight to deutsche bank 's investment team and its clients by sharing his perspective and opinions on a range of issues affecting markets . "
deutsche bank did not comment on greenspan 's salary .
active retirement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank chairman is hoping to profit from greenspan 's considerable experience greenspan headed the us central bank for 18 years .
he started a consultancy and has been prominent on the lecture circuit after handing over the reins to ben bernanke in january .
according to germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- on monday , the economist will not be advising the german bank on asset management as he already works in this role for pacific investment management -lrb- pimco -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 13.08.2007 press review : evidence of shoot-to-kill border policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the berlin wall began 46 years ago german newspapers commented on the discovery of evidence of written orders to east german border soldiers to shoot people , including women and children , fleeing to the west . the document proving that the stasi were ordered to shoot and kill east germans fleeing to west germany comes as the unified country is about to commemorate the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .
" just as with research on national socialism , the same approach must be adopted with respect to the second dark chapter of german history : to explain how it was possible for the gdr to sustain its regime for 28 years , " the bonn paper wrote .
" that is why the politics of the unified germany needs the insights of the stasi archive - at the very least to rebut irresponsible perversions of history that risk being disseminated about the socialist dictatorship , above all in the left party .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .
" just as with research on national socialism , the same approach must be adopted with respect to the second dark chapter of german history : to explain how it was possible for the gdr to sustain its regime for 28 years , " the bonn paper wrote .
" that is why the politics of the unified germany needs the insights of the stasi archive - at the very least to rebut irresponsible perversions of history that risk being disseminated about the socialist dictatorship , above all in the left party .

secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .
" just as with research on national socialism , the same approach must be adopted with respect to the second dark chapter of german history : to explain how it was possible for the gdr to sustain its regime for 28 years , " the bonn paper wrote .
" that is why the politics of the unified germany needs the insights of the stasi archive - at the very least to rebut irresponsible perversions of history that risk being disseminated about the socialist dictatorship , above all in the left party .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .

a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history .

thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "

anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .
maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is led by german brigadier-general friedrich eichele . instead of providing training and advice to criminal investigators and drug enforcement officers , many members of the mission are acting as mentors to police officers trained in earlier programs , der spiegel said . turkey block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan police officer , left , guards suspected taliban men the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is supposed to provide protection for the 20-nation contingent , which is scattered across afghanistan . but a dispute surrounding eu member cyprus and european bloc aspirant and nato member turkey has led to ankara blocking an agreement that regulates cooperation between the eu and the military alliance in afghanistan , the report said . another problem is the reliability of the police recruits , the report added . once they are trained , many offer their services to the taliban , local militia leaders or drug lords , who pay much better than the government in kabul , the report said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .
but if they stick to their opening positions , he acknowledged that there would be little chance for a compromise between the parties that negotiated with un mediator martti ahtisaari for over a year . ´ ' a good start ' to talks from the beginning of the weekend 's talks , the kosovo mediators had met with uncompromising negotiating partners , he said .
nonetheless , the talks are off to a " good start , " ischinger added .
eu , us and russian negotiators started talks on friday in the serbian capitol of belgrade , and continued them in albanian-dominated pristina .
bildunterschrift : troika diplomats , officials met in pristina on saturday after the talks , when asked whether a division of the country would be considered , ischinger said : " if they want to . ...
we are open to any possibilities . "
kosovo pm sticks to plan western policy on kosovo previously ruled out partition , arguing it could spark regional conflict .
any division would be likely to leave the northern slice - where about half of kosovo 's 100,000 serbs live - as part of serbia .
kosovo albanians , who number some 1.9 million , are principally opposed to dividing the province and have instead have called for complete independence from serbia .
after initial talks with the troika on saturday , kosovo 's prime minister agim ceku said he would stick to his demand for an independent serbia .
this should take place this year - and should represent the current borders of the province .
the serbs are not seeking independence .
serbian president boris tadic spoke friday of the " necessity " of keeping serbia 's " sovereignty and territorial integrity . " 120 day time limit along with ischinger , negotiators included russian alexander botsan-kharchenko and us diplomat frank wisner .
the troika was created after russia , a close ally of serbia , refused a suggestion for kosovo independence that the eu and usa brought to the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested for their cause : independence the troika has 120 days to make headway in the region , before presenting a report to the un on dec .
10 .
russia has , however , protested the deadline and called for open-ended talks .
the head of kfor peacekeeping troops , germany 's lt. gen. roland kather , urged a rapid solution in kosovo .
" people need this decision in order to have a clear view of the future , " he told german radio .
residents of kosovo care less about political status of the province than they do about having peaceful lives , he said .
observers say dividing kosovo could be a way out of the dead-end negotiations over kosovo 's status .
the southern-serbian province has been under the administration of the united nations since 1999 , with kfor troops overseeing public security and helping with civil reconstruction . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .
but if they stick to their opening positions , he acknowledged that there would be little chance for a compromise between the parties that negotiated with un mediator martti ahtisaari for over a year . ´ ' a good start ' to talks from the beginning of the weekend 's talks , the kosovo mediators had met with uncompromising negotiating partners , he said .

eu , us and russian negotiators started talks on friday in the serbian capitol of belgrade , and continued them in albanian-dominated pristina .

we are open to any possibilities . "
kosovo pm sticks to plan western policy on kosovo previously ruled out partition , arguing it could spark regional conflict .
any division would be likely to leave the northern slice - where about half of kosovo 's 100,000 serbs live - as part of serbia .
kosovo albanians , who number some 1.9 million , are principally opposed to dividing the province and have instead have called for complete independence from serbia .
after initial talks with the troika on saturday , kosovo 's prime minister agim ceku said he would stick to his demand for an independent serbia .
this should take place this year - and should represent the current borders of the province .
the serbs are not seeking independence .
serbian president boris tadic spoke friday of the " necessity " of keeping serbia 's " sovereignty and territorial integrity . " 120 day time limit along with ischinger , negotiators included russian alexander botsan-kharchenko and us diplomat frank wisner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .

those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .

realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .

in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens lost its board chairman , heinrich von pierer , in the scandal the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung said us lawyers and auditors had uncovered the payments , which relate to the company 's communications and power-generation divisions .
greater sums than expected internal auditors have been probing the company since december as part of a corruption affair in which payments were made in order to secure contracts .
the new information indicated that the " questionable payments " totaled three times more than previously thought , the südeutsche reported .
it quoted top managers as saying " huge amounts " were involved , and one manager referred to a " shocking sum . "
some 900 million euros were linked to the communications division , as opposed to the 420 million acknowledged earlier by siemens , the paper said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher was named ceo to help save the company 's image siemens refuses comment the transactions dated back to the beginning of the 1990s , the report claimed .
a siemens spokesperson refused to comment on the reports .
" beyond the quarterly report , we do not comment on ongoing internal investigations , " he told the associated press .
illicit payments at the power generation division came to 250 million to 300 million euros .
these flowed from the division into diverse international accounts , the report said .
the activity also went back to the 1990s .
two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the change means the coalition has ended , " kaczynski said after dismissing the league of polish families ' education minister roman giertych and maritime economy minister rafal wiechecki , as well as the agrarian self-defense party 's labor minister anna kalata and construction minister andrzej aumiller . the polish prime minister was given the go-ahead to push for a snap parliamentary vote by his party on saturday .
the league of polish families had already announced it was quitting the coalition .
kaczynski announced the likely date of elections after the law and justice party meeting . " it could be october 21 , or perhaps a week earlier or later , " he said .
" it does n't matter .
it will be november at the latest . " risky political business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been fierce fighting between the pis and its junior coalition partners polls suggest that jaroslaw and his twin brother , poland 's president lech kaczynski , are unlikely to come out on top in the approaching election , which is coming two years ahead of schedule . the most recent surveys from the tns obop institute shows the opposition liberal civic platform party with 33 percent of the vote compared to 22 percent for the pis .
meanwhile , analysts said that the rural self-defense party and the nationalist league of polish families may not even pass the 5 percent threshold required to win seats in parliament .
poland has seen fast economic growth under the kaczynski brothers , but they have gained a reputation as troublemakers in the european union and have fought almost constantly with their domestic coalition partners . european rift , coalition strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have gained a reputation as troublemakers early elections have been in the cards since early july when the premier sacked andrzej lepper , the deputy prime minister and leader of self defense over corruption allegations .
lepper , who has denied any wrongdoing , was questioned on sunday by investigators examining the land sales that led to his sacking .
the forthcoming election campaign looks set to be just as acrimonious as the current row . lpr leader giertych said the prime minister had told him he had tapes of top politicians that were so shocking they would " make people 's shoes fall off . "
a government spokesman has denied this . parliament reconvenes on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .
maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 13.08.2007 german banks continue to feel us credit crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european stocks started to recover monday but german banks still felt the bite german banks are still looking vulnerable to the after-shocks of the us subprime mortgages credit crunch of last week .
new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .
" we are not under pressure to sell .
we have spoken about it with investors and rating agencies . " article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .

inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .

more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .

anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .

realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .
but if they stick to their opening positions , he acknowledged that there would be little chance for a compromise between the parties that negotiated with un mediator martti ahtisaari for over a year . ´ ' a good start ' to talks from the beginning of the weekend 's talks , the kosovo mediators had met with uncompromising negotiating partners , he said .

we are open to any possibilities . "
kosovo pm sticks to plan western policy on kosovo previously ruled out partition , arguing it could spark regional conflict .
any division would be likely to leave the northern slice - where about half of kosovo 's 100,000 serbs live - as part of serbia .
kosovo albanians , who number some 1.9 million , are principally opposed to dividing the province and have instead have called for complete independence from serbia .
after initial talks with the troika on saturday , kosovo 's prime minister agim ceku said he would stick to his demand for an independent serbia .
this should take place this year - and should represent the current borders of the province .
the serbs are not seeking independence .
serbian president boris tadic spoke friday of the " necessity " of keeping serbia 's " sovereignty and territorial integrity . " 120 day time limit along with ischinger , negotiators included russian alexander botsan-kharchenko and us diplomat frank wisner .
the troika was created after russia , a close ally of serbia , refused a suggestion for kosovo independence that the eu and usa brought to the un security council .

the head of kfor peacekeeping troops , germany 's lt. gen. roland kather , urged a rapid solution in kosovo .
" people need this decision in order to have a clear view of the future , " he told german radio .
residents of kosovo care less about political status of the province than they do about having peaceful lives , he said .

kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .
but if they stick to their opening positions , he acknowledged that there would be little chance for a compromise between the parties that negotiated with un mediator martti ahtisaari for over a year . ´ ' a good start ' to talks from the beginning of the weekend 's talks , the kosovo mediators had met with uncompromising negotiating partners , he said .
nonetheless , the talks are off to a " good start , " ischinger added .
eu , us and russian negotiators started talks on friday in the serbian capitol of belgrade , and continued them in albanian-dominated pristina .

kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .
but if they stick to their opening positions , he acknowledged that there would be little chance for a compromise between the parties that negotiated with un mediator martti ahtisaari for over a year . ´ ' a good start ' to talks from the beginning of the weekend 's talks , the kosovo mediators had met with uncompromising negotiating partners , he said .
nonetheless , the talks are off to a " good start , " ischinger added .
eu , us and russian negotiators started talks on friday in the serbian capitol of belgrade , and continued them in albanian-dominated pristina .
bildunterschrift : troika diplomats , officials met in pristina on saturday after the talks , when asked whether a division of the country would be considered , ischinger said : " if they want to . ...
we are open to any possibilities . "
kosovo pm sticks to plan western policy on kosovo previously ruled out partition , arguing it could spark regional conflict .
any division would be likely to leave the northern slice - where about half of kosovo 's 100,000 serbs live - as part of serbia .
kosovo albanians , who number some 1.9 million , are principally opposed to dividing the province and have instead have called for complete independence from serbia .
after initial talks with the troika on saturday , kosovo 's prime minister agim ceku said he would stick to his demand for an independent serbia .
this should take place this year - and should represent the current borders of the province .
the serbs are not seeking independence .
serbian president boris tadic spoke friday of the " necessity " of keeping serbia 's " sovereignty and territorial integrity . " 120 day time limit along with ischinger , negotiators included russian alexander botsan-kharchenko and us diplomat frank wisner .
the troika was created after russia , a close ally of serbia , refused a suggestion for kosovo independence that the eu and usa brought to the un security council .

russia has , however , protested the deadline and called for open-ended talks .
the head of kfor peacekeeping troops , germany 's lt. gen. roland kather , urged a rapid solution in kosovo .
" people need this decision in order to have a clear view of the future , " he told german radio .
residents of kosovo care less about political status of the province than they do about having peaceful lives , he said .
observers say dividing kosovo could be a way out of the dead-end negotiations over kosovo 's status .
the southern-serbian province has been under the administration of the united nations since 1999 , with kfor troops overseeing public security and helping with civil reconstruction . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens lost its board chairman , heinrich von pierer , in the scandal the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung said us lawyers and auditors had uncovered the payments , which relate to the company 's communications and power-generation divisions .
greater sums than expected internal auditors have been probing the company since december as part of a corruption affair in which payments were made in order to secure contracts .
the new information indicated that the " questionable payments " totaled three times more than previously thought , the südeutsche reported .
it quoted top managers as saying " huge amounts " were involved , and one manager referred to a " shocking sum . "
some 900 million euros were linked to the communications division , as opposed to the 420 million acknowledged earlier by siemens , the paper said .

a siemens spokesperson refused to comment on the reports .
" beyond the quarterly report , we do not comment on ongoing internal investigations , " he told the associated press .
illicit payments at the power generation division came to 250 million to 300 million euros .
these flowed from the division into diverse international accounts , the report said .
the activity also went back to the 1990s .
two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .
" just as with research on national socialism , the same approach must be adopted with respect to the second dark chapter of german history : to explain how it was possible for the gdr to sustain its regime for 28 years , " the bonn paper wrote .
" that is why the politics of the unified germany needs the insights of the stasi archive - at the very least to rebut irresponsible perversions of history that risk being disseminated about the socialist dictatorship , above all in the left party .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .
" just as with research on national socialism , the same approach must be adopted with respect to the second dark chapter of german history : to explain how it was possible for the gdr to sustain its regime for 28 years , " the bonn paper wrote .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .

last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .

sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .
but if they stick to their opening positions , he acknowledged that there would be little chance for a compromise between the parties that negotiated with un mediator martti ahtisaari for over a year . ´ ' a good start ' to talks from the beginning of the weekend 's talks , the kosovo mediators had met with uncompromising negotiating partners , he said .
nonetheless , the talks are off to a " good start , " ischinger added .
eu , us and russian negotiators started talks on friday in the serbian capitol of belgrade , and continued them in albanian-dominated pristina .
bildunterschrift : troika diplomats , officials met in pristina on saturday after the talks , when asked whether a division of the country would be considered , ischinger said : " if they want to . ...
we are open to any possibilities . "
kosovo pm sticks to plan western policy on kosovo previously ruled out partition , arguing it could spark regional conflict .
any division would be likely to leave the northern slice - where about half of kosovo 's 100,000 serbs live - as part of serbia .
kosovo albanians , who number some 1.9 million , are principally opposed to dividing the province and have instead have called for complete independence from serbia .
after initial talks with the troika on saturday , kosovo 's prime minister agim ceku said he would stick to his demand for an independent serbia .
this should take place this year - and should represent the current borders of the province .
the serbs are not seeking independence .
serbian president boris tadic spoke friday of the " necessity " of keeping serbia 's " sovereignty and territorial integrity . " 120 day time limit along with ischinger , negotiators included russian alexander botsan-kharchenko and us diplomat frank wisner .
the troika was created after russia , a close ally of serbia , refused a suggestion for kosovo independence that the eu and usa brought to the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested for their cause : independence the troika has 120 days to make headway in the region , before presenting a report to the un on dec .

russia has , however , protested the deadline and called for open-ended talks .
the head of kfor peacekeeping troops , germany 's lt. gen. roland kather , urged a rapid solution in kosovo .
" people need this decision in order to have a clear view of the future , " he told german radio .
residents of kosovo care less about political status of the province than they do about having peaceful lives , he said .
observers say dividing kosovo could be a way out of the dead-end negotiations over kosovo 's status .
the southern-serbian province has been under the administration of the united nations since 1999 , with kfor troops overseeing public security and helping with civil reconstruction . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .
" we are not under pressure to sell .
we have spoken about it with investors and rating agencies . " article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens lost its board chairman , heinrich von pierer , in the scandal the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung said us lawyers and auditors had uncovered the payments , which relate to the company 's communications and power-generation divisions .
greater sums than expected internal auditors have been probing the company since december as part of a corruption affair in which payments were made in order to secure contracts .
the new information indicated that the " questionable payments " totaled three times more than previously thought , the südeutsche reported .
it quoted top managers as saying " huge amounts " were involved , and one manager referred to a " shocking sum . "
some 900 million euros were linked to the communications division , as opposed to the 420 million acknowledged earlier by siemens , the paper said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher was named ceo to help save the company 's image siemens refuses comment the transactions dated back to the beginning of the 1990s , the report claimed .
a siemens spokesperson refused to comment on the reports .
" beyond the quarterly report , we do not comment on ongoing internal investigations , " he told the associated press .
illicit payments at the power generation division came to 250 million to 300 million euros .
these flowed from the division into diverse international accounts , the report said .
the activity also went back to the 1990s .
two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .
" we are not under pressure to sell .

the report puts the blame on the kabul government . efforts by the european union to train afghanistan 's police are not going according to plan , the german news magazine der spiegel reported . although most members of a 160-strong police assistance mission have been in the country since june , they have very little to do , the magazine said in its online edition on saturday . the report blamed the inactivity on the afghan government 's failure to name participants for the planned training courses . the eu agreed on the assistance mission in may , the first time the bloc assumed a collective role in aiding afghanistan 's law-enforcement sector .
it is led by german brigadier-general friedrich eichele . instead of providing training and advice to criminal investigators and drug enforcement officers , many members of the mission are acting as mentors to police officers trained in earlier programs , der spiegel said . turkey block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan police officer , left , guards suspected taliban men the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is supposed to provide protection for the 20-nation contingent , which is scattered across afghanistan . but a dispute surrounding eu member cyprus and european bloc aspirant and nato member turkey has led to ankara blocking an agreement that regulates cooperation between the eu and the military alliance in afghanistan , the report said . another problem is the reliability of the police recruits , the report added . once they are trained , many offer their services to the taliban , local militia leaders or drug lords , who pay much better than the government in kabul , the report said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .

a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .
maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .
" we are not under pressure to sell .
we have spoken about it with investors and rating agencies . " article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .

anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .

the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens lost its board chairman , heinrich von pierer , in the scandal the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung said us lawyers and auditors had uncovered the payments , which relate to the company 's communications and power-generation divisions .
greater sums than expected internal auditors have been probing the company since december as part of a corruption affair in which payments were made in order to secure contracts .
the new information indicated that the " questionable payments " totaled three times more than previously thought , the südeutsche reported .
it quoted top managers as saying " huge amounts " were involved , and one manager referred to a " shocking sum . "
some 900 million euros were linked to the communications division , as opposed to the 420 million acknowledged earlier by siemens , the paper said .

a siemens spokesperson refused to comment on the reports .
" beyond the quarterly report , we do not comment on ongoing internal investigations , " he told the associated press .
illicit payments at the power generation division came to 250 million to 300 million euros .
these flowed from the division into diverse international accounts , the report said .
the activity also went back to the 1990s .

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens lost its board chairman , heinrich von pierer , in the scandal the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung said us lawyers and auditors had uncovered the payments , which relate to the company 's communications and power-generation divisions .
greater sums than expected internal auditors have been probing the company since december as part of a corruption affair in which payments were made in order to secure contracts .
the new information indicated that the " questionable payments " totaled three times more than previously thought , the südeutsche reported .
it quoted top managers as saying " huge amounts " were involved , and one manager referred to a " shocking sum . "
some 900 million euros were linked to the communications division , as opposed to the 420 million acknowledged earlier by siemens , the paper said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher was named ceo to help save the company 's image siemens refuses comment the transactions dated back to the beginning of the 1990s , the report claimed .
a siemens spokesperson refused to comment on the reports .
" beyond the quarterly report , we do not comment on ongoing internal investigations , " he told the associated press .
illicit payments at the power generation division came to 250 million to 300 million euros .
these flowed from the division into diverse international accounts , the report said .
the activity also went back to the 1990s .
two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .
" just as with research on national socialism , the same approach must be adopted with respect to the second dark chapter of german history : to explain how it was possible for the gdr to sustain its regime for 28 years , " the bonn paper wrote .
" that is why the politics of the unified germany needs the insights of the stasi archive - at the very least to rebut irresponsible perversions of history that risk being disseminated about the socialist dictatorship , above all in the left party .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .
" we are not under pressure to sell .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .
maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo could be divided into serbian and albanian sectors - a notion heretofore taboo - if all parties agreed to it , ischinger noted .
if both sides are prepared to follow up on any option , it would be " good for us , " ischinger told the press .
but if they stick to their opening positions , he acknowledged that there would be little chance for a compromise between the parties that negotiated with un mediator martti ahtisaari for over a year . ´ ' a good start ' to talks from the beginning of the weekend 's talks , the kosovo mediators had met with uncompromising negotiating partners , he said .
nonetheless , the talks are off to a " good start , " ischinger added .
eu , us and russian negotiators started talks on friday in the serbian capitol of belgrade , and continued them in albanian-dominated pristina .
bildunterschrift : troika diplomats , officials met in pristina on saturday after the talks , when asked whether a division of the country would be considered , ischinger said : " if they want to . ...
we are open to any possibilities . "
kosovo pm sticks to plan western policy on kosovo previously ruled out partition , arguing it could spark regional conflict .
any division would be likely to leave the northern slice - where about half of kosovo 's 100,000 serbs live - as part of serbia .
kosovo albanians , who number some 1.9 million , are principally opposed to dividing the province and have instead have called for complete independence from serbia .
after initial talks with the troika on saturday , kosovo 's prime minister agim ceku said he would stick to his demand for an independent serbia .
this should take place this year - and should represent the current borders of the province .
the serbs are not seeking independence .
serbian president boris tadic spoke friday of the " necessity " of keeping serbia 's " sovereignty and territorial integrity . " 120 day time limit along with ischinger , negotiators included russian alexander botsan-kharchenko and us diplomat frank wisner .
the troika was created after russia , a close ally of serbia , refused a suggestion for kosovo independence that the eu and usa brought to the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested for their cause : independence the troika has 120 days to make headway in the region , before presenting a report to the un on dec .
10 .
russia has , however , protested the deadline and called for open-ended talks .
the head of kfor peacekeeping troops , germany 's lt. gen. roland kather , urged a rapid solution in kosovo .
" people need this decision in order to have a clear view of the future , " he told german radio .
residents of kosovo care less about political status of the province than they do about having peaceful lives , he said .
observers say dividing kosovo could be a way out of the dead-end negotiations over kosovo 's status .
the southern-serbian province has been under the administration of the united nations since 1999 , with kfor troops overseeing public security and helping with civil reconstruction . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "

that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .

editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .

the document , written in october 1973 , is intended only for operatives of the intelligence service , the stasi , working within border guard units and not at the rank-and-file .
it urges : " do n't shy away from using your weapon , even if the breach of the border involves women and children . "
munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung commented : " it is an old psychological truth that there are things that are easier to do than to say . … the stasi apparatus expressed in words what it was prepared to do : to shoot at women and children .
that is , besides the possible legal consequences , an important piece of information about the gdr and the extent of its moral decay . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people killed fleeing to the west is still not known for sure the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " the persistence with which the one-time leaders of the gdr deny the existence of an order to shoot on the border between the two germanys , has become reminiscent of the macabre discussion about whether hitler himself actually gave the order to exterminate the jews in europe .
that , too , was never found . "
the faz commentator added : " just as it would have been absolutely inconceivable for the killing machinery to be set in motion by state authorities without an order from ' the very top , " so , too , could nothing have happened at east germany 's ' anti-fascist protection wall ' without an order .
and what kind of officer is supposed to have given the order on his own authority ?
secretly recruited stasi commandos , as it has just been shown again , had to ensure that an order that allegedly did not exist had to be rigorously enforced . "
editorialists from eastern germany 's sächsische zeitung focused on the continued denial by the former leaders of the communist regime of any order to shoot .
" no one can credibly continue to maintain that the gdr had no radical orders to kill its own citizens , " the paper opined .
" hundreds of people did not survive their attempts to escape to west germany .
but there are some former functionaries of the communist state who deny this very order to kill .
some of them are still politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former communist leaders still deny any official shoot-to-kill policy the stuttgarter nachrichten stressed the historical significance of the find and questioned the timing of its release .
" it was no coincidence that it has been revealed just before the anniversary of the building of the wall that there was an order to shoot at the border between east and west germany , " the paper wrote .
" the document was found some time ago .
but the stasi archive has shown its historical expertise by publishing it now .
as a result today 's anniversary will make more of an impact on public consciousness . "
the paper also called for the german government not to forget the deaths that took place while the country was divided .
" again and again people , particularly in the east , have been calling for the files to finally be closed , this shows just how wrong that is , " the daily said .
" we should be doing the opposite .
it is in german interest to keep the memory of what has happened alive . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger saw the discovery of the document as a vindication of the importance of the secret police archive run by marianne birthler and stressed its significance for german politics .
" just as with research on national socialism , the same approach must be adopted with respect to the second dark chapter of german history : to explain how it was possible for the gdr to sustain its regime for 28 years , " the bonn paper wrote .
" that is why the politics of the unified germany needs the insights of the stasi archive - at the very least to rebut irresponsible perversions of history that risk being disseminated about the socialist dictatorship , above all in the left party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .

driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .
maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens lost its board chairman , heinrich von pierer , in the scandal the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung said us lawyers and auditors had uncovered the payments , which relate to the company 's communications and power-generation divisions .
greater sums than expected internal auditors have been probing the company since december as part of a corruption affair in which payments were made in order to secure contracts .
the new information indicated that the " questionable payments " totaled three times more than previously thought , the südeutsche reported .
it quoted top managers as saying " huge amounts " were involved , and one manager referred to a " shocking sum . "
some 900 million euros were linked to the communications division , as opposed to the 420 million acknowledged earlier by siemens , the paper said .

" beyond the quarterly report , we do not comment on ongoing internal investigations , " he told the associated press .
illicit payments at the power generation division came to 250 million to 300 million euros .
these flowed from the division into diverse international accounts , the report said .
the activity also went back to the 1990s .

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .

" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .

the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .

siemens auditors said they have again uncovered illicit payments in the german electronics concern 's books , and these times the sums were reported to be " shocking " and over a billion euros . investigators examining the siemens books say they have found dubious payments dating back to the early 1990s totaling more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , during their probe of the traditional german industrial concern , a newspaper reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens lost its board chairman , heinrich von pierer , in the scandal the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung said us lawyers and auditors had uncovered the payments , which relate to the company 's communications and power-generation divisions .
greater sums than expected internal auditors have been probing the company since december as part of a corruption affair in which payments were made in order to secure contracts .
the new information indicated that the " questionable payments " totaled three times more than previously thought , the südeutsche reported .
it quoted top managers as saying " huge amounts " were involved , and one manager referred to a " shocking sum . "
some 900 million euros were linked to the communications division , as opposed to the 420 million acknowledged earlier by siemens , the paper said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher was named ceo to help save the company 's image siemens refuses comment the transactions dated back to the beginning of the 1990s , the report claimed .
a siemens spokesperson refused to comment on the reports .
" beyond the quarterly report , we do not comment on ongoing internal investigations , " he told the associated press .
illicit payments at the power generation division came to 250 million to 300 million euros .
these flowed from the division into diverse international accounts , the report said .
the activity also went back to the 1990s .
two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .
maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this must be investigated further " , said social democrat leader kurt beck .
" the whole political system of the gdr is tainted by murder . "
beck 's fellow sdp member , wolfgang thierse , the vice-president of the lower house of parliament , added that the recently discovered document proving the guards on the berlin wall had orders to use lethal force during the cold war " proves that we are still a long way from understanding the gdr ’ s history . "
thierse added that he found it absurd and outrageous that former gdr head of state , egon krenz , and other surviving east german politicians and officials still denied the shoot-to-kill policy , as if " the border guards murdered people at will and for fun . "
the east german regime had long claimed that the killings at the border , which was fortified with concrete , barbed wire and armed guards , were only a " last resort " to stop escapes when other methods such as firing warning shots were exhausted .
a lesson not fully learnt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are still mourned petra pau of the opposition left party called for a full investigation into the document and the policy .
" this must be pursued judicially because murder does not come under the statute of limitations , " she said .
ronald pofalla , the secretary-general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called the document a clear lesson " for all those who would gladly let the cruelty of that regime disappear into the drawers of history forever . "
on the 46th anniversary of the start of construction on the despised berlin wall , german prosecutors were also considering a full investigation .
a spokesperson for the state prosecutors office said authorities were weighing " whether further steps are necessary . "
as the country on monday held somber memorial ceremonies it conducts each year on the wall anniversary , officials said the new discovery made clear that this chapter of german history was not yet closed .
document describes indiscriminate policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guards were ordered not to hesitate to shoot the controversial document , uncovered last week and published at the weekend , contains clear orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including children .
" do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " the key passage , whose author is unknown , wrote .
a spokesman for the stasi archive acknowledged sunday that the passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience .
the discovery also prompted criticism of the federal office overseeing the massive archive of files left behind by the ministry for state security , or stasi , which was one of the most far-reaching and repressive intelligence services in the soviet bloc .
" it raises the question for me whether the office fulfilled its legal obligation to inform the state prosecutor 's office about its suspicion that a crime was committed , " the director of a stasi memorial in berlin , hubertus knabe , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin woke on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.08.2007 urinal driving simulator attempts to cut drink-related deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would the piss-screen have prevented this nasty crash ?
anything which helps to reduce the number of deaths through drink-driving must be lauded .
but is the urinal driving simulator a credible attempt or are its creators just taking the piss ? in days gone by , those deemed to be too " overly refreshed " to drive would be asked by the attending law enforcement officer to walk in a straight line to ascertain the level of sobriety .
those who slalomed down the road like a down-hill skier would have their car keys confiscated before being pointed in the direction of home with some stern advice ringing in their ears .
nowadays , education seems to have taken the place of hands-on prevention .
with fewer police officers around to stop determined drunks getting in their vehicles , it has been left in recent years to grisly posters and blood-splattered commercials to try and persuade death-wish drinkers to take a taxi home .
sadly , the number of deaths and accidents attributed to drunk driving seems to show that the message in this medium is not getting through .
maybe it is because these adverts and public service announcements never crop up when you ’ ve had a skin-full .
or they do and you 're just too plastered to take any notice .
when sober , the sight of an x-rated anti-drink driving message with mangled steel and broken bodies can convince even the most wayward soul to stay off the sauce .
but put ten pints inside that soul and you might as well be showing him starsky and hutch re-runs .
which is why advertising gurus saatchi & saatchi have developed the next generation of educational devices aimed at teaching would-be drunk drivers a lesson : the piss-screen .
driving simulator powered by driver 's own stream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heads i get the blue car , tails you get the red . "
realizing that posters and tv spots rarely grab the attention of drunken men unless they star barely-clad females , the advertising company - commissioned by the german city of frankfurt am main and its taxi drivers - has designed its learning tool to be used in the one place where it is almost guaranteed that drinkers will see it .
away from the bar , and fast food outlets , men on the lash will always have to relieve themselves .
which is why the piss-screen is positioned in the pub urinals .
in an attempt to keep potential drunk drivers out of their cars and get them safely into one of frankfurt 's numerous taxi cabs , the piss-screen combines the interactivity of a computer driving game with the necessity of taking a leak .
by peeing on either the left or right sensor on the game pad positioned in the urinal , the driver can steer the car through computerized streets on the screen in front of him .
the more drunk the driver is , the slower his reactions are likely to be .
the slower his reactions , the higher the chance of him having a gratuitously nasty on-screen crash .
the thinking behind this being that the nastier and more gruesome the crash , the more likely it is that the driver will realize how hammered he is which in turn will lead to him getting a cab home .
a recipe for beer-fuelled disaster ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " damn drunk drivers ! "
while this is an honorable attempt at preventing unnecessary deaths on the real-life streets of frankfurt , the creators of the piss-screen have overlooked one of the main factors in the psyche of the drunken male .
inebriated men become hugely competitive .
crashing the car in the piss-screen game will only make the drunken man more determined to complete the course successfully .
this can only be exacerbated by having a whole wall of wasted guys trying to piss their cars around the course faster than the others while making high-pitch formula one noises .
however , after emptying the bladder on one attempt , the drunken man - now more determined than ever after his first crash - will return to the bar for more fuel .
the next few attempts will of course show a rapid deterioration of driving skill , angering the drunken man further .
a number of unpleasant scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned urinals in the day before computer screens the end result could go a number of ways : the drunks tumble out of the bar into their own cars to really find out " who the daddy is , " with unavoidably disastrous effects .
more likely , the losing drivers will smash the piss-screens up in a rage before spending the night in the cells without , thankfully , claiming any lives .
the third , and probably safest , option will be that the constant pit-stops will render all the drivers completely incapacitated .
in this final scenario , the frankfurt taxi drivers - who were so desperate for clients that they employed saatchi & saatchi to develop a campaign for them - can go into the toilets and pick up as many passengers as they want off the flooded floors and charge them a small fortune to get them home .
maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new stateside bankruptcies and tremors from earlier ones are unnerving the german banking sector . despite european stocks rising in early morning trading on monday in a reverse of the two-day slump stemming from us subprime mortgages credit crunch , the bad news for german banks continued as reports broke of another us building society with connections to germany filing for bankruptcy .
german banks deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag , along with french bank bnp paribas , are among the creditors of homebanc corp. and are all listed as ' lenders ' in homebanc 's filings which were sent to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- on friday .
while reports on the bankruptcy did not specify how much homebanc owed to each bank , the filings to the sec listed its assets at $ 5.1 billion with debts of $ 4.9 billion .
the us subprime crisis also continued to dog germany 's troubled ikb industriebank ag .
after being bailed out to the tune of 8.1billion euros -lrb- $ 11.1billion -rrb- in the form of a liquidity line from the state-owned development bank kfw last month , ikb admitted friday that the state prosecutor 's office in düsseldorf had launched an investigation into the bank .
prosecutors said they had received two complaints about ikb and its information policy in relation to the us credit crunch .
they did not elaborate on the substance of the complaints .
ikb said that it would support and cooperate with the prosecutors .
ikb feeling the bite of us credit crunch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb had a week to forget as the crunch took affect it has been a torrid few days for ikb .
last week when the us crisis first emerged , ikb said that it had " felt the impact " from across the atlantic and that its operating profit target for the fiscal year , forecasted at 280 million euros , would not be met .
a subsequent announcement over potential losses related to its exposure in the us subprime markets saw investors flee the stricken bank 's rhineland funding fund .
then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .

then on thursday , german banking officials agreed to form a banking pool to shield ikb from any further losses or credit squeezes .
and by the weekend , both the bank 's chief executive , stefan ortseifen , and its chief financial officer , volker doberanzke , had resigned .
it has been reported that ikb and its affiliates or associates extended a total of 7.8 billion euros in the us mortgage sector , more than twice the 3.5 billion hitherto considered likely by financial experts .
ibk itself invested 544 million euros , its luxembourg-based subsidiary 757 million and the rhineland funding capital corporation a massive 6.5 billion , it said .
the bank could face further problems if the european commission decides to investigate the kfw rescue package .
the commission is alarmed at the german state bank 's action and has given germany less than a month to show it did not break eu competition laws .
sachsenlb and westlb issue assurances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis sent global markets into chaos at the same time , sachsenlb had to deny reports that it was at risk of being caught up in the growing crisis in the us housing market .
sachsenlb said friday it was not concerned about its ormond quay fund following a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that the german stock market watchdog was probing the bank because the fund was similar to the rhineland funding fund operated by ikb .
such funds are exposed to subprime mortgage loans , meaning loans to americans who have poor credit ratings - one of the sources of the current crisis .
meanwhile , westlb issued a statement at the weekend assuring its investors that its 1.25 billion euro exposure to subprime-related securities through subsidiaries was " relatively limited " and that the securities were highly rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb assured investors that its securities were stable spokesperson hans obermeier said that 98 percent of westlb 's securities were rated " a " or better , while 87 percent were rated " aa " or better .
" the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " he said .
" we are not under pressure to sell .

the annual event coincided with a new moon , providing stargazers with the best viewing conditions for years .
the shower lasts about two weeks , but reached its peak overnight on sunday .
it was most apparent in the north-east part of the sky near the perseus constellation - prime viewing locations were western europe and north america .
dr robert massey from the uk 's royal astronomical society said that as many as 100 meteors an hour would have been visible where the sky was clearest and darkest .
tiny particles the annual perseid showers are caused by small bits of debris , many no bigger than a grain of sand , that enter the earth 's atmosphere when our orbit passes through the tail of the swift-tuttle comet .
these particles travel at very high speeds , reaching up to 50km per second -lrb- 32 miles per second -rrb- , and burn up in the atmosphere .
this causes the air around them to get extremely hot , which produces the visible streak of light .
david hughes , professor of astronomy at the university of sheffield said the particles typically burned up at 97 to 193km -lrb- 60 to 120 miles -rrb- above the earth 's surface .
" we should have been able to see these things - i 'm sure - for millennia .
the first record of these is about 1,000 years ago , " professor hughes told the bbc .
the perseids were traditionally known as the " tears of st lawrence " because they often appeared around the saint 's feast day .
" it 's a spectacular phenomenon that everyone can enjoy .
the great thing is that you do n't need any equipment apart from your eyes , " dr massey said .
" it 's a laid back form of astronomy .
you can go outside , look up at the sky and enjoy it . "
as an added bonus , watchers should have been able to see mars , which was set to be in view as a bright red dot in the eastern sky after midnight .

the annual event coincided with a new moon , providing stargazers with the best viewing conditions for years .
the shower lasts about two weeks , but reached its peak overnight on sunday .
it was most apparent in the north-east part of the sky near the perseus constellation - prime viewing locations were western europe and north america .
dr robert massey from the uk 's royal astronomical society said that as many as 100 meteors an hour would have been visible where the sky was clearest and darkest .
tiny particles the annual perseid showers are caused by small bits of debris , many no bigger than a grain of sand , that enter the earth 's atmosphere when our orbit passes through the tail of the swift-tuttle comet .
these particles travel at very high speeds , reaching up to 50km per second -lrb- 32 miles per second -rrb- , and burn up in the atmosphere .
this causes the air around them to get extremely hot , which produces the visible streak of light .
david hughes , professor of astronomy at the university of sheffield said the particles typically burned up at 97 to 193km -lrb- 60 to 120 miles -rrb- above the earth 's surface .
the meteors were visible as streaks crossing the paths of stars " we should have been able to see these things - i 'm sure - for millennia .
the first record of these is about 1,000 years ago , " professor hughes told the bbc .
the perseids were traditionally known as the " tears of st lawrence " because they often appeared around the saint 's feast day .
" it 's a spectacular phenomenon that everyone can enjoy .
the great thing is that you do n't need any equipment apart from your eyes , " dr massey said .
" it 's a laid back form of astronomy .
you can go outside , look up at the sky and enjoy it . "
as an added bonus , watchers should have been able to see mars , which was set to be in view as a bright red dot in the eastern sky after midnight .

more than 3.5 million older people have mental health problems according to the uk inquiry into mental health and well-being in later life .
but years of under-funding and age discrimination in mental health services prevented people obtaining support and treatment , they said .
the government said they had set out guidance on improving services .
according to the inquiry , up to one in four people over 65 and two in five people over 85 - are suffering depression or serious symptoms of depression and one in five people over 80 suffers dementia .
action to improve the lives of older people who experience mental health difficulties is long overdue dr june crown one man 's story there are also higher rates of suicide in people over the age of 75 .
yet older people with mental health problems are often ignored and receive little support , the inquiry concluded .
it is estimated that two-thirds of older people with depression never even discuss it with their gps , and of the third that do discuss it , only half are diagnosed and treated .
even when they are diagnosed , older people are less likely to be offered treatment and the inquiry said some gps believe depression is simply a symptom of growing older .
discrimination in 2006 , a review of progress against the government 's national service framework for older people found that explicit age discrimination had not declined in mental health services .
and people over the age of 65 often receive different , lower cost and inferior services to younger people - even if they have same condition , the inquiry panel said .
dr june crown , chair of the inquiry , said mental health problems in later life were often preventable and treatable .
" action to improve the lives of older people who experience mental health difficulties is long overdue .
" current services for older people with mental health problems are inadequate in range , in quantity and in quality .
" our report draws attention to groups of older people who are currently invisible in the uk , who have been denied the fair treatment that should be a hallmark of a civilised society . "
dr crown told bbc radio 4 's today programme rates of depression were increasing among older people .
she said : " what we are very concerned about is that older people do n't get necessarily treatment for their depression even when they do report it to gps .
" and if they do they 're much less likely to be offered counselling and psychotherapy and are much more likely than younger people to be given tablets . "
there needed to be much more coordination of policy and the government should give a minister responsibility for the issue , she added .

more than 3.5 million older people have mental health problems according to the uk inquiry into mental health and well-being in later life .
but years of under-funding and age discrimination in mental health services prevented people obtaining support and treatment , they said .
the government said they had set out guidance on improving services .
according to the inquiry , up to one in four people over 65 and two in five people over 85 - are suffering depression or serious symptoms of depression and one in five people over 80 suffers dementia .
action to improve the lives of older people who experience mental health difficulties is long overdue dr june crown one man 's story there are also higher rates of suicide in people over the age of 75 .
yet older people with mental health problems are often ignored and receive little support , the inquiry concluded .
it is estimated that two-thirds of older people with depression never even discuss it with their gps , and of the third that do discuss it , only half are diagnosed and treated .
even when they are diagnosed , older people are less likely to be offered treatment and the inquiry said some gps believe depression is simply a symptom of growing older .
discrimination in 2006 , a review of progress against the government 's national service framework for older people found that explicit age discrimination had not declined in mental health services .
and people over the age of 65 often receive different , lower cost and inferior services to younger people - even if they have same condition , the inquiry panel said .
dr june crown , chair of the inquiry , said mental health problems in later life were often preventable and treatable .
" action to improve the lives of older people who experience mental health difficulties is long overdue .
" current services for older people with mental health problems are inadequate in range , in quantity and in quality .
" our report draws attention to groups of older people who are currently invisible in the uk , who have been denied the fair treatment that should be a hallmark of a civilised society . "
dr crown told bbc radio 4 's today programme rates of depression were increasing among older people .
she said : " what we are very concerned about is that older people do n't get necessarily treatment for their depression even when they do report it to gps .
" and if they do they 're much less likely to be offered counselling and psychotherapy and are much more likely than younger people to be given tablets . "
there needed to be much more coordination of policy and the government should give a minister responsibility for the issue , she added .

" cyberspace will be leaking into the real world , " said science-fiction visionary vernor vinge during a session at the siggraph conference that discussed whether the rise of user-generated worlds was a fad or the start of something more profound .
already online worlds such as second life challenged notions of what was meant by " cyberspace " , said amy bruckman , associate professor in the college of computing at the georgia institute of technology .
coined by william gibson , cyberspace has been defined as the " place " where a telephone conversation appears to occur .
increasingly it has been associated with online spaces , often games , where people go to play and socialize and are represented by an avatar .
however , said prof bruckman , it was becoming obvious that blogs and myspace and facebook pages were also in cyberspace , even though they also had strong links to the real world , because they were used to showcase events such as birthday parties , excursions or the birth of their children .
intelligent world technological advances , said mr vinge , guaranteed that the barriers between online and offline worlds would evaporate .
" soon , we should be able to get very high bit rates down to the last yard or fraction of an inch , " he said .
" -lsb- eventually -rsb- we will be able to get them to down to individuals even if they are free standing and untethered . "
at the same time , said mr vinge , the world would start to be populated with objects bearing embedded computers .
" the natural world around us will acquire a certain amount of innate intelligence , " he said .
" things will know what they are and where they are . "
at first , he said , it was likely that the screens on the devices we carried , such as mobile phones , would act as windows on to the world of data starting to surround us .
then other methods would be found to display this information - maybe initially on to spectacles and perhaps eventually by a direct link into the brain , said mr vinge .
the combination of fast net access and personal displays would bring about the unification of the virtual and real , he said .
in such a situation , virtual worlds would likely to be very widely used .
some would be personal and perhaps just help someone with a task they were doing such as repairing a car or decorating a room .
world power other sorts of virtual worlds , he suggested , could be put to more questionable uses .
" if you can have sports enhancement drugs you could certainly have that type of virtual reality to help a player , " he said .
mr vinge suggested one situation in which a person in the real world was connected to a vast community of people who can see and hear what they experience in a remote many-to-one connection .
" you could become superhuman in terms of your access to knowledge and expertise , " he said .
there was no doubt , he said , that such worlds would be built by the people that use them .
the empowerment that access to tools for creating virtual worlds gave individuals and groups was so extraordinary that preventing it from being universal made no sense , he said .
" we have six billion people in the world and hundreds of millions of people connected , " he said .
" that is an awesome force for production . "
" it 's a real source of optimism for the modern day , " said mr vinge .

" cyberspace will be leaking into the real world , " said science-fiction visionary vernor vinge during a session at the siggraph conference that discussed whether the rise of user-generated worlds was a fad or the start of something more profound .
already online worlds such as second life challenged notions of what was meant by " cyberspace " , said amy bruckman , associate professor in the college of computing at the georgia institute of technology .
coined by william gibson , cyberspace has been defined as the " place " where a telephone conversation appears to occur .
increasingly it has been associated with online spaces , often games , where people go to play and socialize and are represented by an avatar .
however , said prof bruckman , it was becoming obvious that blogs and myspace and facebook pages were also in cyberspace , even though they also had strong links to the real world , because they were used to showcase events such as birthday parties , excursions or the birth of their children .
intelligent world technological advances , said mr vinge , guaranteed that the barriers between online and offline worlds would evaporate .
" soon , we should be able to get very high bit rates down to the last yard or fraction of an inch , " he said .
" -lsb- eventually -rsb- we will be able to get them to down to individuals even if they are free standing and untethered . "
mobile phones could become a portal to another world at the same time , said mr vinge , the world would start to be populated with objects bearing embedded computers .
" the natural world around us will acquire a certain amount of innate intelligence , " he said .
" things will know what they are and where they are . "
at first , he said , it was likely that the screens on the devices we carried , such as mobile phones , would act as windows on to the world of data starting to surround us .
then other methods would be found to display this information - maybe initially on to spectacles and perhaps eventually by a direct link into the brain , said mr vinge .
the combination of fast net access and personal displays would bring about the unification of the virtual and real , he said .
in such a situation , virtual worlds would likely to be very widely used .
some would be personal and perhaps just help someone with a task they were doing such as repairing a car or decorating a room .
world power other sorts of virtual worlds , he suggested , could be put to more questionable uses .
virtual worlds could give humans superhuman powers " if you can have sports enhancement drugs you could certainly have that type of virtual reality to help a player , " he said .
mr vinge suggested one situation in which a person in the real world was connected to a vast community of people who can see and hear what they experience in a remote many-to-one connection .
" you could become superhuman in terms of your access to knowledge and expertise , " he said .
there was no doubt , he said , that such worlds would be built by the people that use them .
the empowerment that access to tools for creating virtual worlds gave individuals and groups was so extraordinary that preventing it from being universal made no sense , he said .
" we have six billion people in the world and hundreds of millions of people connected , " he said .
" that is an awesome force for production . "
" it 's a real source of optimism for the modern day , " said mr vinge .

" cyberspace will be leaking into the real world , " said science-fiction visionary vernor vinge during a session at the siggraph conference that discussed whether the rise of user-generated worlds was a fad or the start of something more profound .
already online worlds such as second life challenged notions of what was meant by " cyberspace " , said amy bruckman , associate professor in the college of computing at the georgia institute of technology .
coined by william gibson , cyberspace has been defined as the " place " where a telephone conversation appears to occur .
increasingly it has been associated with online spaces , often games , where people go to play and socialize and are represented by an avatar .
however , said prof bruckman , it was becoming obvious that blogs and myspace and facebook pages were also in cyberspace , even though they also had strong links to the real world , because they were used to showcase events such as birthday parties , excursions or the birth of their children .
intelligent world technological advances , said mr vinge , guaranteed that the barriers between online and offline worlds would evaporate .
" soon , we should be able to get very high bit rates down to the last yard or fraction of an inch , " he said .
" -lsb- eventually -rsb- we will be able to get them to down to individuals even if they are free standing and untethered . "
mobile phones could become a portal to another world at the same time , said mr vinge , the world would start to be populated with objects bearing embedded computers .
" the natural world around us will acquire a certain amount of innate intelligence , " he said .
" things will know what they are and where they are . "
at first , he said , it was likely that the screens on the devices we carried , such as mobile phones , would act as windows on to the world of data starting to surround us .
then other methods would be found to display this information - maybe initially on to spectacles and perhaps eventually by a direct link into the brain , said mr vinge .
the combination of fast net access and personal displays would bring about the unification of the virtual and real , he said .
in such a situation , virtual worlds would likely to be very widely used .
some would be personal and perhaps just help someone with a task they were doing such as repairing a car or decorating a room .
world power other sorts of virtual worlds , he suggested , could be put to more questionable uses .
virtual worlds could give humans superhuman powers " if you can have sports enhancement drugs you could certainly have that type of virtual reality to help a player , " he said .
mr vinge suggested one situation in which a person in the real world was connected to a vast community of people who can see and hear what they experience in a remote many-to-one connection .
" you could become superhuman in terms of your access to knowledge and expertise , " he said .
there was no doubt , he said , that such worlds would be built by the people that use them .
the empowerment that access to tools for creating virtual worlds gave individuals and groups was so extraordinary that preventing it from being universal made no sense , he said .
" we have six billion people in the world and hundreds of millions of people connected , " he said .
" that is an awesome force for production . "
" it 's a real source of optimism for the modern day , " said mr vinge .

in recent years a decline in the population and the spread of disease has seen grouse numbers dwindle .
animal rights ' groups condemned the shoot and said grouse shooting had , in some places , gone from being a country sport to an ' industrial ' activity .
the game conservancy trust experts predict a warm spring and rigorous pest control programme should result in an increase in shoots .

he inspires such devotion that every year 600,000 people make the pilgrimage to his former home graceland .
half of them are too young to remember the day he died .
presley is sometimes portrayed as a figure of fun from his latter years - gluttonous and drugged in a rhinestone jumpsuit .
but the truth is that he changed popular music forever .
" before elvis there was nothing , " john lennon famously said .
the beatle may have been bending the truth a little - presley drew on a vast well of what was then called " race music " .
but for many he was the first singer to bring rock and roll into the living room .
" it was like he came along and whispered some dream in everybody 's ear , " recalled bruce springsteen .
' aphrodisiac ' songs like hound dog , all shook up and jailhouse rock defined not only an era , but a new musical movement aimed squarely at the teenager - and not everyone was impressed .
early concerts saw the star chased by fans who tore at his clothes " his kind of music is deplorable , " raged frank sinatra .
" a rancid smelling aphrodisiac . "
" it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people . "
indeed , presley was repeatedly branded vulgar by moral guardians in the us , particularly after his hip-swivelling appearances on the ed sullivan tv show .
critics also sniped that presley was neither a musician nor a songwriter .
but the star provided something much more important - his voice .
presley released more than 60 albums before he died raised on gospel music and blues , his vocals were always impassioned and committed , even on shmaltzy ballads like are you lonesome tonight ?
with meatier material such as in the ghetto , presley 's delivery could reduce an audience to tears .
of course , that song had particular resonance for the star .
he was born into poverty in a two-room house in tupelo , mississippi .
his older twin brother , garon , was stillborn , and his mother worked as a cotton-picker .
chart success presley received his first guitar aged 12 and , six years later , he paid $ 3.98 to cut a demo at the memphis recording studios .
his second recording , from 1954 , found its way into the hands of sun records founder sam phillips , who quickly realised this " white man with the negro sound and the negro feel " would make him a fortune .
he guided presley through the early stages of his career , propelling him to number one in the country music charts and sending him out on the live circuit .
presley 's films include blue hawaii and viva las vegas -lrb- pictured -rrb- when the singer got too big for sun records , phillips sold his protege 's contract to rca for the then-unprecedented sum of $ 35,000 .
his first record for the label , 1956 's heartbreak hotel , was also his first number one .
in the same year , presley starred in the first of his 31 films , love me tender .
the run of chart hits kept coming even after he was drafted into the army in 1958 , thanks to his manager , colonel tom parker .
formerly the mastermind behind a dancing chicken circus act , parker exerted an uncanny level of control over presley 's career .
more concerned with money than quality , he ruthlessly exploited presley 's popularity , particularly during the mid-60s " hollywood period " which saw the star appear in an increasingly banal series of b-movies .
tv comeback these reached their nadir with 1965 's harum scarum - in which the king of rock 'n'roll dons a turban and prances around the desert singing while trying to escape a gang of assassins .
elvis and priscilla 's daughter lisa-marie was born in 1968 significantly , presley defied parker when he set about recording a spectacular 1968 tv show , later dubbed his comeback special .
the colonel had envisioned a christmas show , but presley sided with director steve binder , who wanted something more dynamic .
the singer duly obliged , performing hits old and new with a raw energy he rarely displayed on celluloid .
despite a rave response from the studio audience , presley was wracked with nerves when the show was broadcast , according to his then wife , priscilla .
" elvis was quiet and tense through the whole programme , " she wrote in her 1985 autobiography , elvis and me , " but as soon as the calls started we all knew he had a triumph . "
riding the crest of his comeback , presley scored a string of hit singles - including in the ghetto and suspicious minds - and embarked on a four-week , million-dollar stint at the international hotel in las vegas .
the star 's white rhinestone jumpsuit became iconic behind the scenes , however , the star was troubled .
his marriage fell apart in 1972 , and he filed for divorce on his birthday in 1973 .
he was plagued by self-doubt , and a gruelling schedule of touring and recording only exacerbated his increasing dependency on drugs .
presley claimed he needed pills to boost his energy while performing , followed by a different set of drugs to wind down after the show .
footage from his final concerts shows him going through the motions , even parodying his once-masterful voice .
but if presley was disillusioned and broken by global fame , it may be because he was the first to discover exactly what it entailed .

he inspires such devotion that every year 600,000 people make the pilgrimage to his former home graceland .
half of them are too young to remember the day he died .
presley is sometimes portrayed as a figure of fun from his latter years - gluttonous and drugged in a rhinestone jumpsuit .
but the truth is that he changed popular music forever .
" before elvis there was nothing , " john lennon famously said .
the beatle may have been bending the truth a little - presley drew on a vast well of what was then called " race music " .
but for many he was the first singer to bring rock and roll into the living room .
" it was like he came along and whispered some dream in everybody 's ear , " recalled bruce springsteen .
' aphrodisiac ' songs like hound dog , all shook up and jailhouse rock defined not only an era , but a new musical movement aimed squarely at the teenager - and not everyone was impressed .
early concerts saw the star chased by fans who tore at his clothes " his kind of music is deplorable , " raged frank sinatra .
" a rancid smelling aphrodisiac . "
" it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people . "
indeed , presley was repeatedly branded vulgar by moral guardians in the us , particularly after his hip-swivelling appearances on the ed sullivan tv show .
critics also sniped that presley was neither a musician nor a songwriter .
but the star provided something much more important - his voice .
presley released more than 60 albums before he died raised on gospel music and blues , his vocals were always impassioned and committed , even on shmaltzy ballads like are you lonesome tonight ?
with meatier material such as in the ghetto , presley 's delivery could reduce an audience to tears .
of course , that song had particular resonance for the star .
he was born into poverty in a two-room house in tupelo , mississippi .
his older twin brother , garon , was stillborn , and his mother worked as a cotton-picker .
chart success presley received his first guitar aged 12 and , six years later , he paid $ 3.98 to cut a demo at the memphis recording studios .
his second recording , from 1954 , found its way into the hands of sun records founder sam phillips , who quickly realised this " white man with the negro sound and the negro feel " would make him a fortune .
he guided presley through the early stages of his career , propelling him to number one in the country music charts and sending him out on the live circuit .
presley 's films include blue hawaii and viva las vegas -lrb- pictured -rrb- when the singer got too big for sun records , phillips sold his protege 's contract to rca for the then-unprecedented sum of $ 35,000 .
his first record for the label , 1956 's heartbreak hotel , was also his first number one .
in the same year , presley starred in the first of his 31 films , love me tender .
the run of chart hits kept coming even after he was drafted into the army in 1958 , thanks to his manager , colonel tom parker .
formerly the mastermind behind a dancing chicken circus act , parker exerted an uncanny level of control over presley 's career .
more concerned with money than quality , he ruthlessly exploited presley 's popularity , particularly during the mid-60s " hollywood period " which saw the star appear in an increasingly banal series of b-movies .
tv comeback these reached their nadir with 1965 's harum scarum - in which the king of rock 'n'roll dons a turban and prances around the desert singing while trying to escape a gang of assassins .
elvis and priscilla 's daughter lisa-marie was born in 1968 significantly , presley defied parker when he set about recording a spectacular 1968 tv show , later dubbed his comeback special .
the colonel had envisioned a christmas show , but presley sided with director steve binder , who wanted something more dynamic .
the singer duly obliged , performing hits old and new with a raw energy he rarely displayed on celluloid .
despite a rave response from the studio audience , presley was wracked with nerves when the show was broadcast , according to his then wife , priscilla .
" elvis was quiet and tense through the whole programme , " she wrote in her 1985 autobiography , elvis and me , " but as soon as the calls started we all knew he had a triumph . "

the plans have been put forward by john redwood - one of the most senior figures on the tory right - who called them " a tax cut by any other name " .
the focus is on easing regulation such as data protection laws , rules on hours , and health and safety regimes .
labour claims the proposals show the party is lurching back to the right in the face of disappointing polls .
' creative and enterprising ' mr redwood told the bbc that the proposals were aimed at improving britain 's " ability to compete " .
he said there had been previous successes in deregulation , such as opening up the telecommunications market .
" we need to extend that experience much more widely across the economy and show that getting rid of unnecessary rules and regulations is creative , is enterprising and extremely helpful to those who need some help in life . "
" i 'm absolutely sure the conservative government wants an enterprising britain " john redwood mp he said businesses which did not have to spend money on such regulations could instead invest the cash .
the report will call for the repeal of working time regulations and many rules affecting the financial services industry .
other proposed measures include scrapping controversial home information packs -lrb- hips -rrb- and relaxing the regulations on herbal remedies , charity bingo and raffles .
the policy package has been drawn up by a policy review group , set up by mr cameron and headed by mr redwood .
mr cameron , who has refused to bow to internal pressure to promise upfront tax cuts , was reported to be fully backing the plans .
shadow chancellor george osborne worked on the proposals with mr redwood , but a party spokesman said he was only advising him on how to write and present the report . "
the proposals give labour plenty of ammunition for an attack " bbc political correspondent laura kuenssberg the spokesman also told the bbc the proposals were not party policy and they would need to pass through " many hoops " before being adopted .
mr redwood told the bbc : " i 'm absolutely sure the conservative government wants an enterprising britain , and will recognise that means fewer rules and regulations - and fewer rules and regulations that achieve the opposite of what they set out to achieve . "
labour poll lead labour has seized on the proposals as evidence the right wing of the tory " old guard " is confidently pushing its agenda again .
cabinet minister andy burnham said it was a sure sign of mr cameron 's " loss of grip and authority " .
" and to shore up his position with the right wing , cameron is letting the old guard sing the old tunes again , " he said .
" but this directly undermines the spending pledges cameron has been making .
he is losing control and all his pr stunts to suggest change are being exposed as nothing more than that , empty stunts . "
" if these reports are true the conservative party will put itself on the side of bad employers and undercut the good who are happy to obey these legal minimum standards " tuc liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable claimed the conservatives ' figures did not add up .
" the tories once again claim to be able to cut taxes while pretending that no-one will have to pay , showing that these plans are as spurious as the last , " he said .
the confederation of british industry cautiously welcomed mr redwood 's proposal .
" we welcome any ideas that could reduce the intolerable burden on business from red tape , " a spokesman said .
" each proposal is bound to bring hard choices and we 'll need to examine them further .
what we need to do is make sure that it is the red tape we are getting rid of and that is not a lowering of standards . "
a spokesman for the tuc said : " if these reports are true the conservative party will put themselves on the side of bad employers and undercut the good who are happy to obey these legal minimum standards . "
the tory proposal comes amid a poll suggesting labour has moved to 10 points ahead of the conservatives since gordon brown took over as prime minister .
the poll for yougov put labour on 42 % - two points ahead of a month ago - with the conservatives down one on 32 % and the liberal democrats on 14 % .

the first stage of the £ 330m development will be built at llanilid , near llanharan , following delays caused by sewerage problems and bad weather .
developers said the initial phase of the dragon international ltd plan would feature four film stages and work on a major access road .
construction on the first stage of the plan is set to finish by june 2008 .
oscar-winning actor and director richard attenborough , who has been the project chairman , said in january 2006 the scheme would " build studios that have not been seen for decades throughout the world " .
organisers claim the sound stages and tv studios will make south wales a centre of the uk film industry . "
we have talked about the film studios but there is also potential there for a theme park or attraction that would be an all-weather , 365-days-a-year theme park " mp huw irranca davies the complex aims to bring 12 studios , including one of 30,000 sq ft and two of 20,000 sq ft , to provide facilities for recording anything from a quiz show to a big screen blockbuster .
the studios , which could create 1,700 jobs , are set to be built on the 317-acre site of a former opencast mine between cardiff and bridgend .
the scheme was granted outline planning permission by rhondda cynon taf council in december 2003 and includes consent for a business park , hotel and leisure facilities in addition to the film studios .
ogmore mp huw irranca davies said any spin-off developments would have to be properly served by an upgrading of the road network , including the possibility of another motorway junction .
" we have talked about the film studios but there is also potential there for a theme park or attraction that would be an all-weather , 365-days-a-year theme park , " he said .
" that sort of spin-off certainly does put strain on the infrastructure but i have to give praise to rhondda cynon taf council who have taken this project by the hand all the way through and have put everything in place . "
brian morgan , director of the creative leadership and enterprise centre at the university of wales institute , cardiff , said it was good news the project was " getting off the ground " but he warned the studios would need to offer " a very competitive product " to woo film and tv producers down from their bases in london .
kath ringwald from newport business school said the studios would also have a positive knock-on effect on the local economy .
" for one job that the studio creates we are going to be creating another one in the subsidiary industries and small businesses in wales desperately need this kind of stimulation , " she said .

the first stage of the £ 330m development will be built at llanilid , near llanharan , following delays caused by sewerage problems and bad weather .
developers said the initial phase of the dragon international ltd plan would feature four film stages and work on a major access road .
construction on the first stage of the plan is set to finish by june 2008 .
oscar-winning actor and director richard attenborough , who has been the project chairman , said in january 2006 the scheme would " build studios that have not been seen for decades throughout the world " .
organisers claim the sound stages and tv studios will make south wales a centre of the uk film industry .
we have talked about the film studios but there is also potential there for a theme park or attraction that would be an all-weather , 365-days-a-year theme park mp huw irranca davies the complex aims to bring 12 studios , including one of 30,000 sq ft and two of 20,000 sq ft , to provide facilities for recording anything from a quiz show to a big screen blockbuster .
the studios , which could create 1,700 jobs , are set to be built on the 317-acre site of a former opencast mine between cardiff and bridgend .
the scheme was granted outline planning permission by rhondda cynon taf council in december 2003 and includes consent for a business park , hotel and leisure facilities in addition to the film studios .
ogmore mp huw irranca davies said any spin-off developments would have to be properly served by an upgrading of the road network , including the possibility of another motorway junction .
lord richard attenborough is closely involved in the project " we have talked about the film studios but there is also potential there for a theme park or attraction that would be an all-weather , 365-days-a-year theme park , " he said .
" that sort of spin-off certainly does put strain on the infrastructure but i have to give praise to rhondda cynon taf council who have taken this project by the hand all the way through and have put everything in place . "
brian morgan , director of the creative leadership and enterprise centre at the university of wales institute , cardiff , said it was good news the project was " getting off the ground " but he warned the studios would need to offer " a very competitive product " to woo film and tv producers down from their bases in london .
kath ringwald from newport business school said the studios would also have a positive knock-on effect on the local economy .
" for one job that the studio creates we are going to be creating another one in the subsidiary industries and small businesses in wales desperately need this kind of stimulation , " she said .

barbara reid urged people to stand up and condemn gun violence but admitted she may have antagonised the gangs .
jessie , 15 , was killed after being shot three times as he rode through broadfield park in moss side , manchester in september 2006 .
two men being questioned on suspicion of the murder have been bailed .
the men , aged 21 and 20 , and with links to manchester street gangs , were already in prison and have now been bailed until september 20 while detectives make further inquiries .
he was under immense pressure .
it 's been going on for a number of months and the thing is jessie kept it to himself barbara reid , jessie 's mother ms reid told last week 's inquest into the schoolboy 's death that he was shot down in the notorious area of the city because he had " humiliated " a gang by refusing to join them .
she had been aware a gang was operating in her area before jessie was killed but did not act because he never told her about the threat he faced , ms reid explained .
" i am aware that the gang is in our community , deep-rooted in our community , but because jessie did not tell us that he was under any threat , i just tried to live it down , " she said .
" he was under immense pressure .
it 's been going on for a number of months and the thing is jessie kept it to himself and we , his family , were not aware of the sheer hell he was going through .
anonymous witness " jessie thought he and his friends had got that under control but it is a pity they did not know that it was far bigger than them , " she added .
his death had previously been surrounded by a wall of silence but an anonymous witness came forward for the first time to identify the pair .
the inquest into the teenager 's death was adjourned on wednesday when the new witness , known only as xz , came forward .
special measures had been put in place to protect witnesses at the inquest , which was being held at manchester crown court .
greater manchester police and manchester coroner nigel meadows allowed witnesses to give anonymous testimonies in a bid to find a new lead in the investigation .

he was at the heart of some of the biggest decisions made by the bush administration - and some of the biggest controversies .
mr rove was the chief strategist in george w bush 's two presidential election victories , a role that made him highly regarded by republicans and reviled by democrats .
early in president bush 's second term , mr rove was promoted to deputy chief of staff in charge of most white house policy co-ordination , including matters ranging from homeland security and domestic policy to the economy and national security .
just over a year later in april 2006 , he was relieved of this responsibility to concentrate on electoral politics - fundraising and big-picture thinking ahead of the november mid-term congressional elections .
the white house was grappling with mounting problems and falling approval ratings for the president , partly due to growing dissatisfaction over the handling of the iraq war .
mr rove 's task was to stop the republicans losing control of either or both houses of congress in november .
despite his previous electoral successes , he failed .
prosecutors row the latter part of his time in the bush administration was also overshadowed by investigations into the leaking of an undercover cia agent 's identity - a criminal offence .
rove was chief strategist in both bush 's presidential poll wins mr rove himself was not prosecuted over the leak but another official , lewis " scooter " libby , was found guilty of perjury and obstructing justice in connection with the case .
mr rove has also been at the centre of another political row that has pitted congress against the white house .
the dispute began after attorney general alberto gonzales fired eight federal prosecutors in 2006 - an unusual but not illegal move .
democrats said the sackings were politically motivated and that mr rove knew of the discussions about the firing of the attorneys nearly two years before they were sacked .
mr bush used his executive privilege as president to order mr rove not to testify at hearings on capitol hill .
there are some who considered everything mr rove did as machiavellian machination .
mr rove was accused of using underhand tactics against democrats ever since his teenage years .
as a student , he invited chicago vagrants to turn up for free beer at a plush reception for a democrat state candidate - an incident he later described as a " youthful prank " that he regretted .
later , in 1970 , he won control of the college republicans , and was embroiled in further allegations of dirty tricks .
he found himself being investigated by texas congressman and future president george bush sr , who exonerated him and then hired him .
clear victory since then , mr rove has been closely linked to the bush family 's fortunes , eventually helping propel george w bush into the white house .
he micro-managed his campaigns , but also governed the strategy .
karl rove : in the news and spinning the news he defied convention in the 2004 election campaign by aiming not at the middle ground but at mr bush 's base , the religious right .
the approach worked , delivering a clear victory in the popular vote for mr bush .
the younger bush is said to have endowed mr rove with the nickname " turd blossom " , after the beautiful wild flowers that sprout from cowpats in texas .
it appears the president appreciated his adviser 's ability to bring him out of the stinkiest situation smelling of roses .
mr rove , born in 1950 , survived some tough years .
his father walked out of the family home on christmas day 1969 - his 19th birthday .
then he found out this man was not , in fact , his father .
his mother committed suicide 12 years later .
from inauspicious beginnings , mr rove rose to one of the most powerful positions in us politics and became the man some considered to be the power behind the throne .
his supporters say that for the " genius " of his political direction , he fully deserved to be there .
mr rove has been married twice and has a son .

but are the right questions being asked ? "
like most of the electrified world , i am currently hypnotised by puzzle quest .
a variation on the classic task of matching three gems , it integrates role playing game elements into a simple puzzle game , producing something that has all the short-order appeal of tetris , and all the long-term pull of final fantasy .
and hypnotised is n't a word i use lightly .
the gentle clatter of gems and the steady whirl of primary colours soon become all-consuming .
it 's not that it 's hard to stop playing , it 's that it 's pointless .
just because my ds is closed and my eyes are back on my work does n't mean that i do n't see puzzle quest every time i blink .
just because it 's time for bed does n't mean i 'm not battling an ogre mage on the inside of my eyelids .
it 's a phenomenon most gamers are familiar with .
if you 're spending a lot of time with a game , it becomes your mental screen-saver , popping up when your brain is n't occupied .
it 's most obvious with visually simple , repetitive games like puzzle quest , but it can happen with anything .
screen time and it is n't necessarily just the visuals .
gamers are full of tales of how putting in a lot of screen time can affect how they see the world around them : heavy katamari damacy players tell of how , in the back of their minds , they automatically rank the objects around them small-to-big , as you need to in the game . "
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol " tony hawk 's fans find their eyes searching out fantastical skateboard routes among pedestrian walkways and telephone lines .
people who 've grown up with mario see him keeping pace , running and jumping along the building tops that streak by on a train journey .
at best , it 's a pleasant daydream - a happy reminder of a pastime you enjoy , and at worst , it 's a mild distraction .
until , that is , you swap the games around .
what if my screen dreams are n't of something so patently harmless as puzzle quest ?
what if they 're of the stealth kills in manhunt ?
what if instead of sizing up random objects - bicycles , road signs , can machines - for collection in katamari , i 'm sizing up their potential as weapons , as they can be used in yakuza ?
' abjectly apologise ' i 'd like to say that had never happened to me - it would be reassuring if i could .
but i ca n't .
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol .
it does n't affect my behaviour - i 'm british enough to abjectly apologise every time someone walks into me , or stands on my toes - but i 'd be lying if i said i 've never felt the echo of the violent games i play in my normal life , just as i do the non-violent games .
but saying so publicly is an uncomfortable thing to do .
but why should that be ?
puzzle quest and halo are both fictional .
they 're both , in their way , violent .
all i see when i 'm playing puzzle quest is coloured circles , but the game tells me i 'm slogging it out to the death with sentient opponents .
i have a sword -lrb- a + 3 fire poniard , since you ask -rrb- , and my companion is ever-eager to fill my enemies with arrows .
halo is several degrees more graphic ; manhunt many more than that .

but are the right questions being asked ?
like most of the electrified world , i am currently hypnotised by puzzle quest .
a variation on the classic task of matching three gems , it integrates role playing game elements into a simple puzzle game , producing something that has all the short-order appeal of tetris , and all the long-term pull of final fantasy .
and hypnotised is n't a word i use lightly .
the gentle clatter of gems and the steady whirl of primary colours soon become all-consuming .
it 's not that it 's hard to stop playing , it 's that it 's pointless .
just because my ds is closed and my eyes are back on my work does n't mean that i do n't see puzzle quest every time i blink .
just because it 's time for bed does n't mean i 'm not battling an ogre mage on the inside of my eyelids .
it 's a phenomenon most gamers are familiar with .
if you 're spending a lot of time with a game , it becomes your mental screen-saver , popping up when your brain is n't occupied .
it 's most obvious with visually simple , repetitive games like puzzle quest , but it can happen with anything .
screen time and it is n't necessarily just the visuals .
gamers are full of tales of how putting in a lot of screen time can affect how they see the world around them : heavy katamari damacy players tell of how , in the back of their minds , they automatically rank the objects around them small-to-big , as you need to in the game .
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol tony hawk 's fans find their eyes searching out fantastical skateboard routes among pedestrian walkways and telephone lines .
people who 've grown up with mario see him keeping pace , running and jumping along the building tops that streak by on a train journey .
at best , it 's a pleasant daydream - a happy reminder of a pastime you enjoy , and at worst , it 's a mild distraction .
until , that is , you swap the games around .
what if my screen dreams are n't of something so patently harmless as puzzle quest ?
what if they 're of the stealth kills in manhunt ?
what if instead of sizing up random objects - bicycles , road signs , can machines - for collection in katamari , i 'm sizing up their potential as weapons , as they can be used in yakuza ?
' abjectly apologise ' i 'd like to say that had never happened to me - it would be reassuring if i could .
but i ca n't .
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol .
it does n't affect my behaviour - i 'm british enough to abjectly apologise every time someone walks into me , or stands on my toes - but i 'd be lying if i said i 've never felt the echo of the violent games i play in my normal life , just as i do the non-violent games .
games like manhunt 2 have drawn the ire of campaigners but saying so publicly is an uncomfortable thing to do .
but why should that be ?
puzzle quest and halo are both fictional .
they 're both , in their way , violent .
all i see when i 'm playing puzzle quest is coloured circles , but the game tells me i 'm slogging it out to the death with sentient opponents .
i have a sword -lrb- a + 3 fire poniard , since you ask -rrb- , and my companion is ever-eager to fill my enemies with arrows .
halo is several degrees more graphic ; manhunt many more than that .
but they are all fantasies , and i 'm entirely confident none of them changes how i behave .

gamers are full of tales of how putting in a lot of screen time can affect how they see the world around them : heavy katamari damacy players tell of how , in the back of their minds , they automatically rank the objects around them small-to-big , as you need to in the game .
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol tony hawk 's fans find their eyes searching out fantastical skateboard routes among pedestrian walkways and telephone lines .
people who 've grown up with mario see him keeping pace , running and jumping along the building tops that streak by on a train journey .
at best , it 's a pleasant daydream - a happy reminder of a pastime you enjoy , and at worst , it 's a mild distraction .
until , that is , you swap the games around .
what if my screen dreams are n't of something so patently harmless as puzzle quest ?
what if they 're of the stealth kills in manhunt ?
what if instead of sizing up random objects - bicycles , road signs , can machines - for collection in katamari , i 'm sizing up their potential as weapons , as they can be used in yakuza ?
' abjectly apologise ' i 'd like to say that had never happened to me - it would be reassuring if i could .
but i ca n't .
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol .
it does n't affect my behaviour - i 'm british enough to abjectly apologise every time someone walks into me , or stands on my toes - but i 'd be lying if i said i 've never felt the echo of the violent games i play in my normal life , just as i do the non-violent games .
games like manhunt 2 have drawn the ire of campaigners but saying so publicly is an uncomfortable thing to do .
but why should that be ?
puzzle quest and halo are both fictional .
they 're both , in their way , violent .
all i see when i 'm playing puzzle quest is coloured circles , but the game tells me i 'm slogging it out to the death with sentient opponents .
i have a sword -lrb- a + 3 fire poniard , since you ask -rrb- , and my companion is ever-eager to fill my enemies with arrows .
halo is several degrees more graphic ; manhunt many more than that .
but they are all fantasies , and i 'm entirely confident none of them changes how i behave .
other than when i stay up till 3am playing puzzle quest when i should n't .
anyone who invests hours of focus and energy into an activity knows that it can burn an after-image into their brain .
pianists find themselves practising fingering as they wait at the counter in a sandwich shop .
cross-stichers have flickers of grids and colours as they doze off .
i do n't know what that chap who carved elvis on a pinhead sees when he closes his eyes , but i ' d be willing to take a guess .
but for gamers to admit they experience the same , and to admit they experience the same based on the violent games they may play , is taboo .
games are under such sustained , and unfounded , attack because of the violence that they portray - still dramatically less gruesome that what is commonplace in film and tv - that there is something of a code of silence .
gamers do n't want to give ammunition to those looking to start a witch-hunt .
it means that an interesting and valuable debate is stifled .
we still have a very poor understanding of what effect games have on the people who play them , partly because a great deal of the research that is done is focused on proving , or disproving , the worn-out theory that violent games make people do violent things .
perhaps , to fix that , we need to step away from talking about something as incendiary and extreme as manhunt , and start instead with puzzle quest .

like most of the electrified world , i am currently hypnotised by puzzle quest .

but are the right questions being asked ?
like most of the electrified world , i am currently hypnotised by puzzle quest .
a variation on the classic task of matching three gems , it integrates role playing game elements into a simple puzzle game , producing something that has all the short-order appeal of tetris , and all the long-term pull of final fantasy .
and hypnotised is n't a word i use lightly .
the gentle clatter of gems and the steady whirl of primary colours soon become all-consuming .
it 's not that it 's hard to stop playing , it 's that it 's pointless .
just because my ds is closed and my eyes are back on my work does n't mean that i do n't see puzzle quest every time i blink .
just because it 's time for bed does n't mean i 'm not battling an ogre mage on the inside of my eyelids .
it 's a phenomenon most gamers are familiar with .
if you 're spending a lot of time with a game , it becomes your mental screen-saver , popping up when your brain is n't occupied .
it 's most obvious with visually simple , repetitive games like puzzle quest , but it can happen with anything .
screen time and it is n't necessarily just the visuals .
gamers are full of tales of how putting in a lot of screen time can affect how they see the world around them : heavy katamari damacy players tell of how , in the back of their minds , they automatically rank the objects around them small-to-big , as you need to in the game .
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol tony hawk 's fans find their eyes searching out fantastical skateboard routes among pedestrian walkways and telephone lines .
people who 've grown up with mario see him keeping pace , running and jumping along the building tops that streak by on a train journey .
at best , it 's a pleasant daydream - a happy reminder of a pastime you enjoy , and at worst , it 's a mild distraction .
until , that is , you swap the games around .
what if my screen dreams are n't of something so patently harmless as puzzle quest ?
what if they 're of the stealth kills in manhunt ?
what if instead of sizing up random objects - bicycles , road signs , can machines - for collection in katamari , i 'm sizing up their potential as weapons , as they can be used in yakuza ?
' abjectly apologise ' i 'd like to say that had never happened to me - it would be reassuring if i could .
but i ca n't .
i know that , if i 've spent an entire weekend playing halo and you stick me behind a crowd of slow-moving tourists , there 's a split second when i wish i had my pistol .
it does n't affect my behaviour - i 'm british enough to abjectly apologise every time someone walks into me , or stands on my toes - but i 'd be lying if i said i 've never felt the echo of the violent games i play in my normal life , just as i do the non-violent games .
games like manhunt 2 have drawn the ire of campaigners but saying so publicly is an uncomfortable thing to do .
but why should that be ?
puzzle quest and halo are both fictional .
they 're both , in their way , violent .
all i see when i 'm playing puzzle quest is coloured circles , but the game tells me i 'm slogging it out to the death with sentient opponents .
i have a sword -lrb- a + 3 fire poniard , since you ask -rrb- , and my companion is ever-eager to fill my enemies with arrows .
halo is several degrees more graphic ; manhunt many more than that .
but they are all fantasies , and i 'm entirely confident none of them changes how i behave .
other than when i stay up till 3am playing puzzle quest when i should n't .
anyone who invests hours of focus and energy into an activity knows that it can burn an after-image into their brain .
pianists find themselves practising fingering as they wait at the counter in a sandwich shop .
cross-stichers have flickers of grids and colours as they doze off .
i do n't know what that chap who carved elvis on a pinhead sees when he closes his eyes , but i ' d be willing to take a guess .
but for gamers to admit they experience the same , and to admit they experience the same based on the violent games they may play , is taboo .
games are under such sustained , and unfounded , attack because of the violence that they portray - still dramatically less gruesome that what is commonplace in film and tv - that there is something of a code of silence .
gamers do n't want to give ammunition to those looking to start a witch-hunt .
it means that an interesting and valuable debate is stifled .
we still have a very poor understanding of what effect games have on the people who play them , partly because a great deal of the research that is done is focused on proving , or disproving , the worn-out theory that violent games make people do violent things .
perhaps , to fix that , we need to step away from talking about something as incendiary and extreme as manhunt , and start instead with puzzle quest .

archaeologists said the discovery could be as significant as the famous prehistoric village at skara brae , which was unearthed in 1850 .
the site at ness of brodgar lies in the heart of neolithic orkney , between the ring of brodgar and the stones of stenness .
the finds have included a neolithic mace head and decorated stones .
only a small part of the site has been dug , exposing large oval stone buildings subdivided into small chambers . "
this is going to tell us an enormous amount about how people interacted and worked within the stone circles " julie gibson archaeologist archaeologists from orkney college hope the area will unlock some of the secrets of the people who lived there .
nick card , who is leading the dig , said : " what we have is a whole series of buildings - unfortunately we 've only managed to open a tiny percentage of what is actually here .
" the buildings which we have been uncovered are of a kind never seen before .
" some of the structures do appear to be domestic in nature but one , the main structure in the big trench , is much more complex with very symmetrical architecture .
" the scale of the building and its refinement would suggest that it perhaps had some other function other than domestic . "
archaeologist julie gibson told bbc radio scotland that the site was hugely significant .
she added : " this is going to tell us an enormous amount about how people interacted and worked within the stone circles .
" people who were staying here were probably putting up the stone circles , or certainly having their ceremonies at them - living right next door or coming for meetings there . "
