german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.10.2007 close contest expected in crunch polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling kaczynski brothers want to consolidate power in poland an estimated 30 million poles are eligible to vote sunday in a snap parliamentary election .
the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .
reported fraud levels have not dropped in the eight years since the study was initiated .
yet companies are feeling more confident about their ability to catch criminal employees , the findings show . kerstin winter -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .

the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .

they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .

surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.10.2007 close contest expected in crunch polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling kaczynski brothers want to consolidate power in poland an estimated 30 million poles are eligible to vote sunday in a snap parliamentary election .
the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .
president lech kaczynski 's term expires in 2010 , while the new parliament would be able to sit through 2012 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .

that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .
reported fraud levels have not dropped in the eight years since the study was initiated .
yet companies are feeling more confident about their ability to catch criminal employees , the findings show . kerstin winter -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.10.2007 close contest expected in crunch polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling kaczynski brothers want to consolidate power in poland an estimated 30 million poles are eligible to vote sunday in a snap parliamentary election .
the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .
president lech kaczynski 's term expires in 2010 , while the new parliament would be able to sit through 2012 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .

that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 20.10.2007 economic crime rampant in german companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies do n't want problems made public half of all german companies are affected by white-collar crime , according to a recent study .
german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .
reported fraud levels have not dropped in the eight years since the study was initiated .
yet companies are feeling more confident about their ability to catch criminal employees , the findings show . kerstin winter -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .
president lech kaczynski 's term expires in 2010 , while the new parliament would be able to sit through 2012 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .
reported fraud levels have not dropped in the eight years since the study was initiated .

the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .
president lech kaczynski 's term expires in 2010 , while the new parliament would be able to sit through 2012 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 20.10.2007 economic crime rampant in german companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies do n't want problems made public half of all german companies are affected by white-collar crime , according to a recent study .
german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .

surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .

the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .
president lech kaczynski 's term expires in 2010 , while the new parliament would be able to sit through 2012 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .

that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.10.2007 close contest expected in crunch polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling kaczynski brothers want to consolidate power in poland an estimated 30 million poles are eligible to vote sunday in a snap parliamentary election .
the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .
president lech kaczynski 's term expires in 2010 , while the new parliament would be able to sit through 2012 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .
reported fraud levels have not dropped in the eight years since the study was initiated .
yet companies are feeling more confident about their ability to catch criminal employees , the findings show . kerstin winter -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.10.2007 close contest expected in crunch polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling kaczynski brothers want to consolidate power in poland an estimated 30 million poles are eligible to vote sunday in a snap parliamentary election .
the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .
president lech kaczynski 's term expires in 2010 , while the new parliament would be able to sit through 2012 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the collection of 37,000 works will then be made available to any online reader . all of the books to be scanned are works from the 16th century - from 1518 to 1600 . protection from damage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner sucks two pages towards itself , then captures the words and images digitally while more contemporary-minded readers may find the works a bit bland , the scanning is essential to preserve the fragile , unique works from damage through reader handling . the bavarian library has already enabled users to " borrow " thousands of different books by accessing them online . the library is also collaborating with the us search engine google to digitalize more contemporary books from its collection . up to 1,500 pages per hour for the current scanning project , an austrian firm developed the " scanrobot , " which uses gentle suction and air flows to turn and then scan the pages .
the robot can scan up to 1,500 pages an hour .
similar robots are used in the united states . the project is being sponsored by the german research foundation . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .
reported fraud levels have not dropped in the eight years since the study was initiated .

german companies lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud . it never feels good to get passed over for a promotion or a pay raise , but an increasing number of german employees are taking out their frustrations on employers by engaging in forms of economic crime .
the theft usually takes the form of pocketing company funds or deliberately sabotaging lucrative business deals , a new study found .
white-collar crime causes german companies to lose more than 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- each year due to corruption , embezzlement and fraud , according to a study conducted by the german martin luther university of halle-wittenberg in conjunction with the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and germany 's tns-emnid . attempt made to keep problems private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from walking away with cash to short-changing clients , white-collar crimes take different forms " german companies do not want to make these problems public , so there seems to be no problem , " professor kai bussmann from the university of halle told dw-radio .
" many believe that they are immune to white collar crime .
especially medium-sized companies are a little naive . "
companies are interested in making money quickly .
this causes them to underestimate the risks involved and they can be in danger of going bankrupt , bussmann said .
" half of the culprits work in the firm , the other half are customers , business partners or suppliers , " bussmann added .
" often german companies realize too late that their investments in , let 's say china have been embezzled . "
the study shows it 's extremely risky to do business with china , india , brazil and turkey .
but crime prevention needs to start within the company , the study said .
most german companies do have a code of conduct for their employees , but they do n't have sufficient control mechanisms to monitor whether employees are following the rules .
german corruption scandals , and more generally in all of europe , become public only by coincidence .
this is in contrast to the united states , where most companies have compliance programs .
although expensive , these programs make employees think twice before trying to embezzle and when it does happen , they are detected relatively quickly , bussmann said . better oversight advantageous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has been rocked by a corruption scandal recently the us has obligatory reporting requirements that create a different corporate culture .
that is in contrast to europe .
" in western europe , there are fewer regulations , " bussmann said .
" but the companies here are learning from their mistakes . "
while compliance programs do n't completely stop white-collar crime , less than 30 percent of companies with compliance programs become victims of embezzlement or other misappropriation , the study found .
in germany , companies often keep quiet when they uncover misdeeds out of worry about the firm 's reputation .
while the study put the annual loss at 6 billion euros , the real losses could be significantly higher , the study said .
engineering giant siemens was one german company that could n't keep its corruption scandal secret under wraps .
it has been making headlines for shady deals and bribery that amount to several million euros . the company 's reputation has suffered tremendously and has scared away investors .
but there are signs that siemens learned its lesson .
management has been replaced and a new department has been created that deals only with corruption and monitoring suspicious activity .
the biennial survey of 5,400 global companies , the most comprehensive study of its kind , found that economic crime affected all different types of companies around the globe .
reported fraud levels have not dropped in the eight years since the study was initiated .

the poll is being called the most important since the collapse of communism in 1989 . former polish president and solidarity trade union leader lech walesa said on friday , oct .
19 , that poles had a moral obligation to vote because only a high turnout might defeat the ruling party of prime minister jaroslaw and president lech kaczynski . " we are deciding if our country will be ruled by one family , by two twin brothers who do n't care about democracy and about our rights , " walesa , who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 , told reuters on friday . " it is the most important election since the end of the totalitarian state and we must attend it , " walesa , 64 , added . voters weary of political theater pre-election opinion polls showed the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- pulling ahead of the governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have protested the state of politics in their country the po catapulted into top spot after leader donald tusk dominated two high-profile televised debates , crushing both archrival kaczynski and left-wing contender and former president aleksander kwasniewski . however , given kaczynski 's knack for winning elections opinion polls suggest he will lose , analysts in warsaw are reluctant to predict second spot for the pis . the unrelenting grind of high-pitched scandals , rows , mudslinging and election threats that have dominated polish politics over the two years since the last regular parliamentary election have exhausted the electorate . while some pre-election opinion polls have predicted voter turnout of up to 70 percent on sunday , experts expect a repeat of the record low 40.5 percent showing at the ballot box in september 2005 . most of those who said they intend to vote will so out of a sense of civic duty rather than real enthusiasm .
they will choose what many termed the " lesser evil " in a country where most people consider all politicians to have dirty hands . both the po and pis promised voters a stable coalition prior to the september 2005 election .
the pis won by a narrow margin and subsequently failed to clinch a deal with the liberals . conflict and corruption rips coalition apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski dissolved parliament in september sunday 's snap ballot was called after jaroslaw kaczynski 's conflict-riddled coalition with two small populist parties collapsed this summer amid allegations of corruption .
the prime minister himself pushed for the self-dissolution of parliament on sept .
7 , which triggered the early general election . the snap ballot comes amid allegations by opposition politicians and analysts that jaroslaw kaczynski violated the fundamentals of democracy by using his government 's anti-corruption crusade to cover attempts by the secret service and justice ministry to neutralize his political rivals . kaczynski has , however , brushed aside the allegations as an unfounded smear campaign aimed at torpedoing his government 's effort to eliminate corruption and the grip of so-called " oligarchs , " or self-made polish businessmen , on the state apparatus .
surveys suggest no party will capture an outright majority in sunday 's election , potentially prolonging political instability in the ex-communist country of 38 million .
the votes of more than a million poles currently living and working mostly in the uk and ireland could prove decisive .
opposition promises a reverse of kaczynski policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk impressed poles in a pair of televised debates the business-friendly po is campaigning on promises of boosting entrepreneurship by slashing bureaucracy and introducing a 15 percent flat tax .
the liberals also want a withdrawal of poland 's 900 troops from iraq and have vowed to improve the absorption of vital eu funding . officials in brussels recently warned warsaw risks losing billions of euros in subsidies for much needed highway and public infrastructure projects due to the kaczynski government 's sluggishness in project planning and execution .
poland 's relations within the european union have also experienced stress during two years of rule by prime minister kaczynski and his identical twin brother president lech kaczynski .
this summer , poland threatened to block work on the 27-member bloc 's crucial future constitution and has scuppered a fresh eu-russia agreement over a bilateral poland-russia trade dispute .
political analysts point out that another pis victory would prolong the concentration of executive power in the hands of the twin brothers and could well compromise the health of poland 's democratic system .

university of east anglia researchers gauged co2 absorption through more than 90,000 measurements from merchant ships equipped with automatic instruments .
results of their 10-year study in the north atlantic show co2 uptake halved between the mid-90s and 2000 to 2005 .
scientists believe global warming might get worse if the oceans soak up less of the greenhouse gas .
researchers said the findings , published in a paper for the journal of geophysical research , were surprising and worrying because there were grounds for believing that , in time , the ocean might become saturated with our emissions .
' saturated ' ocean bbc environment analyst roger harrabin said : " the researchers do n't know if the change is due to climate change or to natural variations .
" but they say it is a tremendous surprise and very worrying because there were grounds for believing that in time the ocean might become ' saturated ' with our emissions - unable to soak up any more . "
he said that would " leave all our emissions to warm the atmosphere " .
of all the co2 emitted into the atmosphere , only half of it stays there ; the rest goes into carbon sinks .
there are two major carbon sinks in the biological cycle : the oceans and the land " biosphere " , which includes plants and the soil .

by marie jackson bbc news ernest norton 's killers were aged between 10 and 12 when he died as five boys begin two year sentences in a detention centre for manslaughter , calls are being made for the age of criminal responsibility in england and wales to be raised .
the boys were aged between 10 and 12 when they hurled stones at ernest norton as he played cricket with his son in south-east london , causing him to collapse and die .
had they been in most other countries in western europe , they would have been too young to be considered criminally responsible .
their cases could have resulted in social service action or juvenile proceedings but they would never have faced a trial in a criminal court .
but in england and wales the age of criminal responsibility currently stands at 10 - one of the lowest in the world .
some legal groups and children 's charities want the age raised to 14 , bringing it in line with italy , spain and germany .
lawyer stephen jakobi , of the just umbrella campaign group , believes the british approach to very young offenders is inappropriate .
taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction bobby cummines , unlock " the whole system is a system geared to mini-adults , " he says .
he fears by locking up children we are creating hardened criminals rather than showing children how to become responsible adults .
the figures , he says , bear this out with nearly three in four 10 to 14-year-old boys reoffending within a year of coming out of custody .
bobby cummines , chief executive of unlock , the national association of ex-offenders , says the task of rehabilitating a child can , in fact , be harder than an adult .
an adult will think ' i have done enough time in jail ' and try to change , but a child comes out of the experience very damaged , he says .
criminal ages in europe 10 - england , wales 14 - italy , germany , spain 15 - denmark , finland , norway , sweden 16 - portugal 18 - belgium and luxembourg source : the just umbrella a former bank robber himself , mr cummines has served 13 years behind bars and knows the toll it can take .
a child going into a detention centre will be traumatised for the first few months , he said .
according to mr cummines , then they will feel anger that they can not go back to their family as they realise what they did was a game that went wrong .
they become institutionalised and learn to respond to brutality by being more brutal themselves .
" taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction , " he said .
he believes the age should be raised as high as 16 - any younger and children have varying levels of maturity which make it difficult to judge who among them knows right from wrong .
he accepts in the most serious cases a dangerous child should be locked up , but in so many cases their mental health , background or education are the issue .
it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged ministry of justice spokeswoman the children 's society , which also wants the age raised , believes labelling children criminals and putting them through the court system is ineffective and inappropriate .
glyn farrow , head of children law uk , who also supports raising the age says to do so will require a massive shift in public attitude .
criminal law specialist robert brown believes cases , including the jamie bulger murder by two young boys in 1993 , created such public outrage that the government had to be seen to be tough on crime .
he said he could not foresee any change being made to the age , and recent changes in the law suggested the trend was , in fact , towards becoming tougher on children .
as recently as 1998 , the law was changed to abolish doli incapax - a presumption that a person under 14 does not have the knowledge to know the difference between right and wrong .
this meant the prosecution no longer had to show the children did understand they had done wrong for them to be convicted .
in scotland , children as young as eight can face prosecution .
but except for serious crimes , the majority are dealt with by children 's panels until the age of 16 .
community sentences a ministry of justice spokeswoman said the government has no plans to change the age of criminal responsibility .
as an alternative to detention , which was always a last resort , the range and intensity of community sentences available for young people had been expanded , she said .
the government believes children of 10 and over can differentiate between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing .
" it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged , " she said .
without a trial , could linda norton have felt justice had been done ?
and as det ch insp phil adams said after five boys were convicted in august of killing ernest norton , it was important to think of their victim .
" nobody likes to see children standing in the dock at the old bailey , crying , having been convicted of manslaughter , " he said .
" however your mind must then turn to mr norton 's family .
they have lost a father , a husband and a loved one , and we must not forget that . "
at the sentencing , the judge stressed he was in no doubt that despite their young age , their conduct had been " utterly disgraceful and criminally irresponsible " .
and without that court case , could mr norton 's family ever have felt satisfied that justice had been done ?

lawyer stephen jakobi , of the just umbrella campaign group , believes the british approach to very young offenders is inappropriate .
taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction bobby cummines , unlock " the whole system is a system geared to mini-adults , " he says .
he fears by locking up children we are creating hardened criminals rather than showing children how to become responsible adults .
the figures , he says , bear this out with nearly three in four 10 to 14-year-old boys reoffending within a year of coming out of custody .
bobby cummines , chief executive of unlock , the national association of ex-offenders , says the task of rehabilitating a child can , in fact , be harder than an adult .
an adult will think ' i have done enough time in jail ' and try to change , but a child comes out of the experience very damaged , he says .

a child going into a detention centre will be traumatised for the first few months , he said .
according to mr cummines , then they will feel anger that they can not go back to their family as they realise what they did was a game that went wrong .
they become institutionalised and learn to respond to brutality by being more brutal themselves .
" taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction , " he said .
he believes the age should be raised as high as 16 - any younger and children have varying levels of maturity which make it difficult to judge who among them knows right from wrong .
he accepts in the most serious cases a dangerous child should be locked up , but in so many cases their mental health , background or education are the issue .
it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged ministry of justice spokeswoman the children 's society , which also wants the age raised , believes labelling children criminals and putting them through the court system is ineffective and inappropriate .
glyn farrow , head of children law uk , who also supports raising the age says to do so will require a massive shift in public attitude .
criminal law specialist robert brown believes cases , including the jamie bulger murder by two young boys in 1993 , created such public outrage that the government had to be seen to be tough on crime .
he said he could not foresee any change being made to the age , and recent changes in the law suggested the trend was , in fact , towards becoming tougher on children .
as recently as 1998 , the law was changed to abolish doli incapax - a presumption that a person under 14 does not have the knowledge to know the difference between right and wrong .
this meant the prosecution no longer had to show the children did understand they had done wrong for them to be convicted .
in scotland , children as young as eight can face prosecution .
but except for serious crimes , the majority are dealt with by children 's panels until the age of 16 .
community sentences a ministry of justice spokeswoman said the government has no plans to change the age of criminal responsibility .
as an alternative to detention , which was always a last resort , the range and intensity of community sentences available for young people had been expanded , she said .
the government believes children of 10 and over can differentiate between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing .
" it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged , " she said .
without a trial , could linda norton have felt justice had been done ?
and as det ch insp phil adams said after five boys were convicted in august of killing ernest norton , it was important to think of their victim .
" nobody likes to see children standing in the dock at the old bailey , crying , having been convicted of manslaughter , " he said .
" however your mind must then turn to mr norton 's family .
they have lost a father , a husband and a loved one , and we must not forget that . "
at the sentencing , the judge stressed he was in no doubt that despite their young age , their conduct had been " utterly disgraceful and criminally irresponsible " .
and without that court case , could mr norton 's family ever have felt satisfied that justice had been done ?

by marie jackson bbc news ernest norton 's killers were aged between 10 and 12 when he died as five boys begin two year sentences in a detention centre for manslaughter , calls are being made for the age of criminal responsibility in england and wales to be raised .
the boys were aged between 10 and 12 when they hurled stones at ernest norton as he played cricket with his son in south-east london , causing him to collapse and die .
had they been in most other countries in western europe , they would have been too young to be considered criminally responsible .
their cases could have resulted in social service action or juvenile proceedings but they would never have faced a trial in a criminal court .
but in england and wales the age of criminal responsibility currently stands at 10 - one of the lowest in the world .
some legal groups and children 's charities want the age raised to 14 , bringing it in line with italy , spain and germany .
lawyer stephen jakobi , of the just umbrella campaign group , believes the british approach to very young offenders is inappropriate .
taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction bobby cummines , unlock " the whole system is a system geared to mini-adults , " he says .
he fears by locking up children we are creating hardened criminals rather than showing children how to become responsible adults .
the figures , he says , bear this out with nearly three in four 10 to 14-year-old boys reoffending within a year of coming out of custody .
bobby cummines , chief executive of unlock , the national association of ex-offenders , says the task of rehabilitating a child can , in fact , be harder than an adult .
an adult will think ' i have done enough time in jail ' and try to change , but a child comes out of the experience very damaged , he says .
criminal ages in europe 10 - england , wales 14 - italy , germany , spain 15 - denmark , finland , norway , sweden 16 - portugal 18 - belgium and luxembourg source : the just umbrella a former bank robber himself , mr cummines has served 13 years behind bars and knows the toll it can take .
a child going into a detention centre will be traumatised for the first few months , he said .
according to mr cummines , then they will feel anger that they can not go back to their family as they realise what they did was a game that went wrong .
they become institutionalised and learn to respond to brutality by being more brutal themselves .
" taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction , " he said .
he believes the age should be raised as high as 16 - any younger and children have varying levels of maturity which make it difficult to judge who among them knows right from wrong .
he accepts in the most serious cases a dangerous child should be locked up , but in so many cases their mental health , background or education are the issue .
it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged ministry of justice spokeswoman the children 's society , which also wants the age raised , believes labelling children criminals and putting them through the court system is ineffective and inappropriate .
glyn farrow , head of children law uk , who also supports raising the age says to do so will require a massive shift in public attitude .
criminal law specialist robert brown believes cases , including the jamie bulger murder by two young boys in 1993 , created such public outrage that the government had to be seen to be tough on crime .
he said he could not foresee any change being made to the age , and recent changes in the law suggested the trend was , in fact , towards becoming tougher on children .
as recently as 1998 , the law was changed to abolish doli incapax - a presumption that a person under 14 does not have the knowledge to know the difference between right and wrong .
this meant the prosecution no longer had to show the children did understand they had done wrong for them to be convicted .
in scotland , children as young as eight can face prosecution .
but except for serious crimes , the majority are dealt with by children 's panels until the age of 16 .
community sentences a ministry of justice spokeswoman said the government has no plans to change the age of criminal responsibility .
as an alternative to detention , which was always a last resort , the range and intensity of community sentences available for young people had been expanded , she said .
the government believes children of 10 and over can differentiate between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing .
" it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged , " she said .
without a trial , could linda norton have felt justice had been done ?

the boys were aged between 10 and 12 when they hurled stones at ernest norton as he played cricket with his son in south-east london , causing him to collapse and die .
had they been in most other countries in western europe , they would have been too young to be considered criminally responsible .
their cases could have resulted in social service action or juvenile proceedings but they would never have faced a trial in a criminal court .
but in england and wales the age of criminal responsibility currently stands at 10 - one of the lowest in the world .
some legal groups and children 's charities want the age raised to 14 , bringing it in line with italy , spain and germany .
lawyer stephen jakobi , of the just umbrella campaign group , believes the british approach to very young offenders is inappropriate .
taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction bobby cummines , unlock " the whole system is a system geared to mini-adults , " he says .
he fears by locking up children we are creating hardened criminals rather than showing children how to become responsible adults .
the figures , he says , bear this out with nearly three in four 10 to 14-year-old boys reoffending within a year of coming out of custody .
bobby cummines , chief executive of unlock , the national association of ex-offenders , says the task of rehabilitating a child can , in fact , be harder than an adult .
an adult will think ' i have done enough time in jail ' and try to change , but a child comes out of the experience very damaged , he says .
criminal ages in europe 10 - england , wales 14 - italy , germany , spain 15 - denmark , finland , norway , sweden 16 - portugal 18 - belgium and luxembourg source : the just umbrella a former bank robber himself , mr cummines has served 13 years behind bars and knows the toll it can take .
a child going into a detention centre will be traumatised for the first few months , he said .
according to mr cummines , then they will feel anger that they can not go back to their family as they realise what they did was a game that went wrong .
they become institutionalised and learn to respond to brutality by being more brutal themselves .
" taking a child out of the care of its family - it 's almost like abduction , " he said .
he believes the age should be raised as high as 16 - any younger and children have varying levels of maturity which make it difficult to judge who among them knows right from wrong .
he accepts in the most serious cases a dangerous child should be locked up , but in so many cases their mental health , background or education are the issue .
it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged ministry of justice spokeswoman the children 's society , which also wants the age raised , believes labelling children criminals and putting them through the court system is ineffective and inappropriate .
glyn farrow , head of children law uk , who also supports raising the age says to do so will require a massive shift in public attitude .
criminal law specialist robert brown believes cases , including the jamie bulger murder by two young boys in 1993 , created such public outrage that the government had to be seen to be tough on crime .
he said he could not foresee any change being made to the age , and recent changes in the law suggested the trend was , in fact , towards becoming tougher on children .
as recently as 1998 , the law was changed to abolish doli incapax - a presumption that a person under 14 does not have the knowledge to know the difference between right and wrong .
this meant the prosecution no longer had to show the children did understand they had done wrong for them to be convicted .
in scotland , children as young as eight can face prosecution .
but except for serious crimes , the majority are dealt with by children 's panels until the age of 16 .
community sentences a ministry of justice spokeswoman said the government has no plans to change the age of criminal responsibility .
as an alternative to detention , which was always a last resort , the range and intensity of community sentences available for young people had been expanded , she said .
the government believes children of 10 and over can differentiate between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing .
" it is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged , " she said .
without a trial , could linda norton have felt justice had been done ?
and as det ch insp phil adams said after five boys were convicted in august of killing ernest norton , it was important to think of their victim .
" nobody likes to see children standing in the dock at the old bailey , crying , having been convicted of manslaughter , " he said .
" however your mind must then turn to mr norton 's family .
they have lost a father , a husband and a loved one , and we must not forget that . "
at the sentencing , the judge stressed he was in no doubt that despite their young age , their conduct had been " utterly disgraceful and criminally irresponsible " .
and without that court case , could mr norton 's family ever have felt satisfied that justice had been done ?
