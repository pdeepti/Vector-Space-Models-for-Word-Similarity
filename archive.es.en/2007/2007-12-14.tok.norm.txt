program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.12.2007 germans want to play larger global role , survey shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 46 percent of germans said they think germany will still be a world power in 2020 a new study shows that nearly half of germans see their country as a world power .
but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .
germany is not on a self-righteous , nationalistic course but , in fact , moving in the opposite direction . interview : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with this week 's climate talks in bali wrapping up , readers responded to our many articles covering the event with a degree of uncertainty about the human role in climate change . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . recent research by danish and swedish scientists are blowing the co2 emissions theory away , demonstrating the influence of solar cycles on earth 's temperature .
if you do n't think it 's worth waiting until climate science gets this right before severely impacting industries and the developing nations , then knock yourselves out . - john barnes , usa i am not a scientist so i wo n't dispute whether the climate is changing or not .
but as a layperson who likes to gather information on the issue myself , i am becoming increasingly disturbed by the amount of information i am finding -lrb- mostly internet sources -rrb- from competent scientists who do dispute the validity of the " scientific " findings being drawn upon as a basis for the enormous commotion that we are seeing in the world regarding climate change and co2 .
i think that , if there are valid scientific concerns regarding the validity / accuracy / reliability of the ipcc scientific data , world leaders should stop and consider before deciding to commit vast sums of money to solutions which may turn out to be totally wrong . - rick tachek , germany if you wonder why some of us are so obtuse as to be dubious of the scenarios portrayed by the media about global warming , just look at the item on your newscasts today -lsb- dec .
13 -rsb- in which a group claims that sea turtles may die out if the beaches on which they lay their eggs are inundated by rising sea levels .
oddly , sea turtles have been around for tens of millions of years , and have survived several changes in sea level before , including one at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago .
the people making up these scenarios seem to have no idea of the geological past .
if they did , they would n't make such stupid claims , unnecessarily adding to the hysteria about the subject . - douglas ort , thailand denial is a natural human response when faced with very bad news or a serious prognosis - even when the evidence is beyond proof .
think back to the arrest and prosecution of galileo 300 years ago when he proved that the earth revolves around the sun .
it took a long while for humans to accept that their old beliefs were wrong .
it normally takes around 40 years for such a transition in belief to take place .
even the most brilliant brain ever - albert einstein - took some years to accept the theory of intercontinental drift , long after other scientists were convinced .
i have pity on those few remaining folks who are having trouble accepting the news -lsb- about climate change -rsb- , but i wo n't ridicule them any more than i would ridicule a person who can not accept the news that their loved one has deceased .
denial is a natural response to a serious crisis . - chris harries , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .

14 , to send a police and civilian mission to the serbian breakaway province of kosovo , the eu 's portuguese presidency announced after a summit in brussels . " we took a political decision to send an esdp -lrb- european security and defense policy -rrb- mission to kosovo , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates told reporters . " this is the clearest signal that the european union could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , " he said , adding that the eu mission would be deployed " not before christmas but immediately after . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica vehemently opposes kosovo 's independence but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica branded the mission an attempt to create a " puppet state " on serbian soil . " it is especially insulting to offer a crippled serbia the reward of fast-track to the eu in exchange for its consent to violence , " kostunica said in a statement released in belgrade . the european union 's traditional end-of-year meeting on friday , dec .
14 , came just a day after prime ministers and heads of state gathered in lisbon to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process . diplomats said thursday 's signing ceremony officially ended months of discussions and years of navel-gazing by eu leaders , allowing them to move on to " deal with real issues . " the main " real issue " on the agenda of friday 's meeting was the potential for unrest in the balkans after a failed attempt to negotiate a deal between kosovar and serbian leaders on the future states of kosovo . political test for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority wants independence from serbia peace in the balkans is seen by many observers as a test of the 27-member bloc 's strength as a player in international politics . " we have seen what happened in former yugoslavia when the european union did not take things in hand , " belgian foreign minister karel de gucht said , pointing to the balkans wars in the 1990s that led to thousands of deaths in the region . in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province in serbia , kosovar leaders are set to declare independence in " coordination " with its us and european allies .
serbia is strongly opposed to anything beyond autonomy for kosovo .
it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .

increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .
" food is neither a reward , nor a punishment , " she said , calling for web sites promoting incorrect ideals on weight to be closed down by their operators . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.12.2007 germans want to play larger global role , survey shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 46 percent of germans said they think germany will still be a world power in 2020 a new study shows that nearly half of germans see their country as a world power .
but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .
germany is not on a self-righteous , nationalistic course but , in fact , moving in the opposite direction . interview : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . recent research by danish and swedish scientists are blowing the co2 emissions theory away , demonstrating the influence of solar cycles on earth 's temperature .
if you do n't think it 's worth waiting until climate science gets this right before severely impacting industries and the developing nations , then knock yourselves out . - john barnes , usa i am not a scientist so i wo n't dispute whether the climate is changing or not .
but as a layperson who likes to gather information on the issue myself , i am becoming increasingly disturbed by the amount of information i am finding -lrb- mostly internet sources -rrb- from competent scientists who do dispute the validity of the " scientific " findings being drawn upon as a basis for the enormous commotion that we are seeing in the world regarding climate change and co2 .
i think that , if there are valid scientific concerns regarding the validity / accuracy / reliability of the ipcc scientific data , world leaders should stop and consider before deciding to commit vast sums of money to solutions which may turn out to be totally wrong . - rick tachek , germany if you wonder why some of us are so obtuse as to be dubious of the scenarios portrayed by the media about global warming , just look at the item on your newscasts today -lsb- dec .
13 -rsb- in which a group claims that sea turtles may die out if the beaches on which they lay their eggs are inundated by rising sea levels .
oddly , sea turtles have been around for tens of millions of years , and have survived several changes in sea level before , including one at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago .
the people making up these scenarios seem to have no idea of the geological past .
if they did , they would n't make such stupid claims , unnecessarily adding to the hysteria about the subject . - douglas ort , thailand denial is a natural human response when faced with very bad news or a serious prognosis - even when the evidence is beyond proof .
think back to the arrest and prosecution of galileo 300 years ago when he proved that the earth revolves around the sun .
it took a long while for humans to accept that their old beliefs were wrong .
it normally takes around 40 years for such a transition in belief to take place .
even the most brilliant brain ever - albert einstein - took some years to accept the theory of intercontinental drift , long after other scientists were convinced .
i have pity on those few remaining folks who are having trouble accepting the news -lsb- about climate change -rsb- , but i wo n't ridicule them any more than i would ridicule a person who can not accept the news that their loved one has deceased .
denial is a natural response to a serious crisis . - chris harries , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .

14 , to send a police and civilian mission to the serbian breakaway province of kosovo , the eu 's portuguese presidency announced after a summit in brussels . " we took a political decision to send an esdp -lrb- european security and defense policy -rrb- mission to kosovo , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates told reporters . " this is the clearest signal that the european union could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , " he said , adding that the eu mission would be deployed " not before christmas but immediately after . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica vehemently opposes kosovo 's independence but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica branded the mission an attempt to create a " puppet state " on serbian soil . " it is especially insulting to offer a crippled serbia the reward of fast-track to the eu in exchange for its consent to violence , " kostunica said in a statement released in belgrade . the european union 's traditional end-of-year meeting on friday , dec .
14 , came just a day after prime ministers and heads of state gathered in lisbon to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process . diplomats said thursday 's signing ceremony officially ended months of discussions and years of navel-gazing by eu leaders , allowing them to move on to " deal with real issues . " the main " real issue " on the agenda of friday 's meeting was the potential for unrest in the balkans after a failed attempt to negotiate a deal between kosovar and serbian leaders on the future states of kosovo . political test for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority wants independence from serbia peace in the balkans is seen by many observers as a test of the 27-member bloc 's strength as a player in international politics . " we have seen what happened in former yugoslavia when the european union did not take things in hand , " belgian foreign minister karel de gucht said , pointing to the balkans wars in the 1990s that led to thousands of deaths in the region . in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province in serbia , kosovar leaders are set to declare independence in " coordination " with its us and european allies .
serbia is strongly opposed to anything beyond autonomy for kosovo .
it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , to send a police and civilian mission to the serbian breakaway province of kosovo , the eu 's portuguese presidency announced after a summit in brussels . " we took a political decision to send an esdp -lrb- european security and defense policy -rrb- mission to kosovo , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates told reporters . " this is the clearest signal that the european union could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , " he said , adding that the eu mission would be deployed " not before christmas but immediately after . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica vehemently opposes kosovo 's independence but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica branded the mission an attempt to create a " puppet state " on serbian soil . " it is especially insulting to offer a crippled serbia the reward of fast-track to the eu in exchange for its consent to violence , " kostunica said in a statement released in belgrade . the european union 's traditional end-of-year meeting on friday , dec .
14 , came just a day after prime ministers and heads of state gathered in lisbon to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process . diplomats said thursday 's signing ceremony officially ended months of discussions and years of navel-gazing by eu leaders , allowing them to move on to " deal with real issues . " the main " real issue " on the agenda of friday 's meeting was the potential for unrest in the balkans after a failed attempt to negotiate a deal between kosovar and serbian leaders on the future states of kosovo . political test for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority wants independence from serbia peace in the balkans is seen by many observers as a test of the 27-member bloc 's strength as a player in international politics . " we have seen what happened in former yugoslavia when the european union did not take things in hand , " belgian foreign minister karel de gucht said , pointing to the balkans wars in the 1990s that led to thousands of deaths in the region . in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province in serbia , kosovar leaders are set to declare independence in " coordination " with its us and european allies .
serbia is strongly opposed to anything beyond autonomy for kosovo .
it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.12.2007 readers skeptical of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is climate change real ?
with this week 's climate talks in bali wrapping up , readers responded to our many articles covering the event with a degree of uncertainty about the human role in climate change . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . recent research by danish and swedish scientists are blowing the co2 emissions theory away , demonstrating the influence of solar cycles on earth 's temperature .
if you do n't think it 's worth waiting until climate science gets this right before severely impacting industries and the developing nations , then knock yourselves out . - john barnes , usa i am not a scientist so i wo n't dispute whether the climate is changing or not .
but as a layperson who likes to gather information on the issue myself , i am becoming increasingly disturbed by the amount of information i am finding -lrb- mostly internet sources -rrb- from competent scientists who do dispute the validity of the " scientific " findings being drawn upon as a basis for the enormous commotion that we are seeing in the world regarding climate change and co2 .
i think that , if there are valid scientific concerns regarding the validity / accuracy / reliability of the ipcc scientific data , world leaders should stop and consider before deciding to commit vast sums of money to solutions which may turn out to be totally wrong . - rick tachek , germany if you wonder why some of us are so obtuse as to be dubious of the scenarios portrayed by the media about global warming , just look at the item on your newscasts today -lsb- dec .
13 -rsb- in which a group claims that sea turtles may die out if the beaches on which they lay their eggs are inundated by rising sea levels .
oddly , sea turtles have been around for tens of millions of years , and have survived several changes in sea level before , including one at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago .
the people making up these scenarios seem to have no idea of the geological past .
if they did , they would n't make such stupid claims , unnecessarily adding to the hysteria about the subject . - douglas ort , thailand denial is a natural human response when faced with very bad news or a serious prognosis - even when the evidence is beyond proof .
think back to the arrest and prosecution of galileo 300 years ago when he proved that the earth revolves around the sun .
it took a long while for humans to accept that their old beliefs were wrong .
it normally takes around 40 years for such a transition in belief to take place .
even the most brilliant brain ever - albert einstein - took some years to accept the theory of intercontinental drift , long after other scientists were convinced .
i have pity on those few remaining folks who are having trouble accepting the news -lsb- about climate change -rsb- , but i wo n't ridicule them any more than i would ridicule a person who can not accept the news that their loved one has deceased .
denial is a natural response to a serious crisis . - chris harries , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu pressures us to reach climate consensus in bali germany 's environment minister is leading eu efforts to push the us into accepting climate change targets , warning that if washington blocks progress in bali , eu nations will boycott us-led climate talks next month .
-lrb- 13.12.2007 -rrb- carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth .
-lrb- 13.12.2007 -rrb- un chief pleads for climate breakthrough the time to act is now , said un chief ban ki-moon at the climate conference in bali .
he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week .
-lrb- 12.12.2007 -rrb- climate change : a planet at risk dw-world.de examines the effects of climate change on all seven continents .

but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.12.2007 opinion : reform treaty signed , but neither sealed nor delivered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders said the treaty of lisbon would be the basis for a more modern and democratic europe .
but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .

she appealed for more education and research into the effects .

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .
" food is neither a reward , nor a punishment , " she said , calling for web sites promoting incorrect ideals on weight to be closed down by their operators . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .

the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .

but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .

for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 14.12.2007 revealing film on russian elite faces mysterious roadblock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamborghini owners do n't have anything to fear at the road checks on rublyovka a political documentary that reveals uncomfortable realities in today 's russia premiered this week in germany .
tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .

but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.12.2007 opinion : reform treaty signed , but neither sealed nor delivered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders said the treaty of lisbon would be the basis for a more modern and democratic europe .
but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.12.2007 readers skeptical of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is climate change real ?
with this week 's climate talks in bali wrapping up , readers responded to our many articles covering the event with a degree of uncertainty about the human role in climate change . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . recent research by danish and swedish scientists are blowing the co2 emissions theory away , demonstrating the influence of solar cycles on earth 's temperature .
if you do n't think it 's worth waiting until climate science gets this right before severely impacting industries and the developing nations , then knock yourselves out . - john barnes , usa i am not a scientist so i wo n't dispute whether the climate is changing or not .
but as a layperson who likes to gather information on the issue myself , i am becoming increasingly disturbed by the amount of information i am finding -lrb- mostly internet sources -rrb- from competent scientists who do dispute the validity of the " scientific " findings being drawn upon as a basis for the enormous commotion that we are seeing in the world regarding climate change and co2 .
i think that , if there are valid scientific concerns regarding the validity / accuracy / reliability of the ipcc scientific data , world leaders should stop and consider before deciding to commit vast sums of money to solutions which may turn out to be totally wrong . - rick tachek , germany if you wonder why some of us are so obtuse as to be dubious of the scenarios portrayed by the media about global warming , just look at the item on your newscasts today -lsb- dec .
13 -rsb- in which a group claims that sea turtles may die out if the beaches on which they lay their eggs are inundated by rising sea levels .
oddly , sea turtles have been around for tens of millions of years , and have survived several changes in sea level before , including one at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago .
the people making up these scenarios seem to have no idea of the geological past .
if they did , they would n't make such stupid claims , unnecessarily adding to the hysteria about the subject . - douglas ort , thailand denial is a natural human response when faced with very bad news or a serious prognosis - even when the evidence is beyond proof .
think back to the arrest and prosecution of galileo 300 years ago when he proved that the earth revolves around the sun .
it took a long while for humans to accept that their old beliefs were wrong .
it normally takes around 40 years for such a transition in belief to take place .
even the most brilliant brain ever - albert einstein - took some years to accept the theory of intercontinental drift , long after other scientists were convinced .
i have pity on those few remaining folks who are having trouble accepting the news -lsb- about climate change -rsb- , but i wo n't ridicule them any more than i would ridicule a person who can not accept the news that their loved one has deceased .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.12.2007 germans want to play larger global role , survey shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 46 percent of germans said they think germany will still be a world power in 2020 a new study shows that nearly half of germans see their country as a world power .
but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .
germany is not on a self-righteous , nationalistic course but , in fact , moving in the opposite direction . interview : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , to send a police and civilian mission to the serbian breakaway province of kosovo , the eu 's portuguese presidency announced after a summit in brussels . " we took a political decision to send an esdp -lrb- european security and defense policy -rrb- mission to kosovo , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates told reporters . " this is the clearest signal that the european union could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , " he said , adding that the eu mission would be deployed " not before christmas but immediately after . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica vehemently opposes kosovo 's independence but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica branded the mission an attempt to create a " puppet state " on serbian soil . " it is especially insulting to offer a crippled serbia the reward of fast-track to the eu in exchange for its consent to violence , " kostunica said in a statement released in belgrade . the european union 's traditional end-of-year meeting on friday , dec .
14 , came just a day after prime ministers and heads of state gathered in lisbon to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process . diplomats said thursday 's signing ceremony officially ended months of discussions and years of navel-gazing by eu leaders , allowing them to move on to " deal with real issues . " the main " real issue " on the agenda of friday 's meeting was the potential for unrest in the balkans after a failed attempt to negotiate a deal between kosovar and serbian leaders on the future states of kosovo . political test for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority wants independence from serbia peace in the balkans is seen by many observers as a test of the 27-member bloc 's strength as a player in international politics . " we have seen what happened in former yugoslavia when the european union did not take things in hand , " belgian foreign minister karel de gucht said , pointing to the balkans wars in the 1990s that led to thousands of deaths in the region . in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province in serbia , kosovar leaders are set to declare independence in " coordination " with its us and european allies .
serbia is strongly opposed to anything beyond autonomy for kosovo .
it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .

prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .
" food is neither a reward , nor a punishment , " she said , calling for web sites promoting incorrect ideals on weight to be closed down by their operators . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .

" the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .
" food is neither a reward , nor a punishment , " she said , calling for web sites promoting incorrect ideals on weight to be closed down by their operators . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

" the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.12.2007 germans want to play larger global role , survey shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 46 percent of germans said they think germany will still be a world power in 2020 a new study shows that nearly half of germans see their country as a world power .
but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .
germany is not on a self-righteous , nationalistic course but , in fact , moving in the opposite direction . interview : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 14.12.2007 eu agrees to send mission to kosovo after christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars want independence for their home european union leaders agreed on friday , dec .
14 , to send a police and civilian mission to the serbian breakaway province of kosovo , the eu 's portuguese presidency announced after a summit in brussels . " we took a political decision to send an esdp -lrb- european security and defense policy -rrb- mission to kosovo , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates told reporters . " this is the clearest signal that the european union could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , " he said , adding that the eu mission would be deployed " not before christmas but immediately after . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica vehemently opposes kosovo 's independence but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica branded the mission an attempt to create a " puppet state " on serbian soil . " it is especially insulting to offer a crippled serbia the reward of fast-track to the eu in exchange for its consent to violence , " kostunica said in a statement released in belgrade . the european union 's traditional end-of-year meeting on friday , dec .
14 , came just a day after prime ministers and heads of state gathered in lisbon to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process . diplomats said thursday 's signing ceremony officially ended months of discussions and years of navel-gazing by eu leaders , allowing them to move on to " deal with real issues . " the main " real issue " on the agenda of friday 's meeting was the potential for unrest in the balkans after a failed attempt to negotiate a deal between kosovar and serbian leaders on the future states of kosovo . political test for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority wants independence from serbia peace in the balkans is seen by many observers as a test of the 27-member bloc 's strength as a player in international politics . " we have seen what happened in former yugoslavia when the european union did not take things in hand , " belgian foreign minister karel de gucht said , pointing to the balkans wars in the 1990s that led to thousands of deaths in the region . in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province in serbia , kosovar leaders are set to declare independence in " coordination " with its us and european allies .
serbia is strongly opposed to anything beyond autonomy for kosovo .
it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard .

but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .
germany is not on a self-righteous , nationalistic course but , in fact , moving in the opposite direction . interview : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .

this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .

i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .
germany is not on a self-righteous , nationalistic course but , in fact , moving in the opposite direction . interview : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , to send a police and civilian mission to the serbian breakaway province of kosovo , the eu 's portuguese presidency announced after a summit in brussels . " we took a political decision to send an esdp -lrb- european security and defense policy -rrb- mission to kosovo , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates told reporters . " this is the clearest signal that the european union could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , " he said , adding that the eu mission would be deployed " not before christmas but immediately after . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica vehemently opposes kosovo 's independence but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica branded the mission an attempt to create a " puppet state " on serbian soil . " it is especially insulting to offer a crippled serbia the reward of fast-track to the eu in exchange for its consent to violence , " kostunica said in a statement released in belgrade . the european union 's traditional end-of-year meeting on friday , dec .
14 , came just a day after prime ministers and heads of state gathered in lisbon to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process . diplomats said thursday 's signing ceremony officially ended months of discussions and years of navel-gazing by eu leaders , allowing them to move on to " deal with real issues . " the main " real issue " on the agenda of friday 's meeting was the potential for unrest in the balkans after a failed attempt to negotiate a deal between kosovar and serbian leaders on the future states of kosovo . political test for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority wants independence from serbia peace in the balkans is seen by many observers as a test of the 27-member bloc 's strength as a player in international politics . " we have seen what happened in former yugoslavia when the european union did not take things in hand , " belgian foreign minister karel de gucht said , pointing to the balkans wars in the 1990s that led to thousands of deaths in the region . in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province in serbia , kosovar leaders are set to declare independence in " coordination " with its us and european allies .
serbia is strongly opposed to anything beyond autonomy for kosovo .
it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.12.2007 opinion : reform treaty signed , but neither sealed nor delivered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders said the treaty of lisbon would be the basis for a more modern and democratic europe .
but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 14.12.2007 revealing film on russian elite faces mysterious roadblock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamborghini owners do n't have anything to fear at the road checks on rublyovka a political documentary that reveals uncomfortable realities in today 's russia premiered this week in germany .
tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .
" food is neither a reward , nor a punishment , " she said , calling for web sites promoting incorrect ideals on weight to be closed down by their operators . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .

schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .

a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .

it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation . " i now have the impression that -lsb- esin -rsb- is not independent but has a larger structure behind him , " said langemann , who came to germany in 1990 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union . lichtfilm confirmed to dw-world.de that esin is not responding to their efforts to contact him and that he has neither promoted nor permitted the showing of the film outside of germany , france , austria and switzerland . a connection between the roadblock esin has put on the film and the presidential campaign ties in all too well with langemann 's impressions of her homeland during her stay . just as they were during soviet times , " people are treated like marionettes and not respected as individuals , " she said .

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .

14 , to send a police and civilian mission to the serbian breakaway province of kosovo , the eu 's portuguese presidency announced after a summit in brussels . " we took a political decision to send an esdp -lrb- european security and defense policy -rrb- mission to kosovo , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates told reporters . " this is the clearest signal that the european union could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , " he said , adding that the eu mission would be deployed " not before christmas but immediately after . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica vehemently opposes kosovo 's independence but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica branded the mission an attempt to create a " puppet state " on serbian soil . " it is especially insulting to offer a crippled serbia the reward of fast-track to the eu in exchange for its consent to violence , " kostunica said in a statement released in belgrade . the european union 's traditional end-of-year meeting on friday , dec .
14 , came just a day after prime ministers and heads of state gathered in lisbon to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process . diplomats said thursday 's signing ceremony officially ended months of discussions and years of navel-gazing by eu leaders , allowing them to move on to " deal with real issues . " the main " real issue " on the agenda of friday 's meeting was the potential for unrest in the balkans after a failed attempt to negotiate a deal between kosovar and serbian leaders on the future states of kosovo . political test for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority wants independence from serbia peace in the balkans is seen by many observers as a test of the 27-member bloc 's strength as a player in international politics . " we have seen what happened in former yugoslavia when the european union did not take things in hand , " belgian foreign minister karel de gucht said , pointing to the balkans wars in the 1990s that led to thousands of deaths in the region . in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province in serbia , kosovar leaders are set to declare independence in " coordination " with its us and european allies .
serbia is strongly opposed to anything beyond autonomy for kosovo .
it views the province as an integral part of its country . german defense minister franz josef jung said on friday that he received a letter from his serbian counterpart promising belgrade would not send troops into kosovo should the province declare independence . " he clearly stressed that the serbian side would not resort to violence in kosovo , which is , of course , very important for the peaceful development -lsb- of the province -rsb- , " jung told reporters . speed up accession an option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen said the eu would stand up for peace in the balkans eu leaders are reported to be considering offering belgrade the option of a fast-track to eu membership as one way of maintaining peace in the balkans since the status quo is untenable and a decision on kosovo 's future status is essential for stability in the region , a draft of the summit communiqué said , according to the reuters news agency . " -lsb- the european council -rsb- reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the eu , including candidate status , can be accelerated , " the draft said . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen told reporters ahead of the summit in brussels that by the end of the meeting it needed to be clear that " europe will ensure peace and stability in the balkans " and that " the western balkans have a clear eu perspective . " candidate status is a preliminary step in negotiations for future eu members .
serbia , which receives aid from the eu to institute political and judicial reforms , initialed an association agreement with the bloc last month , but the document is mainly of symbolic value since it is not legally binding . no compromise from serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's foreign minister called trading kosovo for the eu " indecent " serbia , however , would never agree to trade kosovo in order to speed up accession to the european union , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday . " a trade-off is out of the question , " jeremic said .
" it would be an indecent proposal , and european leaders are decent people , they have not made such an offer . " some eu countries , including greece , slovakia , romania and the divided island of cyprus , strongly oppose recognizing an independent kosovo for fear that it might encourage other ethnic minorities to do the same . eu leaders were not expected to reach unanimity on how to react to kosovo 's secessionist plans on friday , but were nevertheless expected to conclude that whatever action they may take would not set a precedent for other minorities in europe seeking autonomy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with this week 's climate talks in bali wrapping up , readers responded to our many articles covering the event with a degree of uncertainty about the human role in climate change . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . recent research by danish and swedish scientists are blowing the co2 emissions theory away , demonstrating the influence of solar cycles on earth 's temperature .
if you do n't think it 's worth waiting until climate science gets this right before severely impacting industries and the developing nations , then knock yourselves out . - john barnes , usa i am not a scientist so i wo n't dispute whether the climate is changing or not .
but as a layperson who likes to gather information on the issue myself , i am becoming increasingly disturbed by the amount of information i am finding -lrb- mostly internet sources -rrb- from competent scientists who do dispute the validity of the " scientific " findings being drawn upon as a basis for the enormous commotion that we are seeing in the world regarding climate change and co2 .
i think that , if there are valid scientific concerns regarding the validity / accuracy / reliability of the ipcc scientific data , world leaders should stop and consider before deciding to commit vast sums of money to solutions which may turn out to be totally wrong . - rick tachek , germany if you wonder why some of us are so obtuse as to be dubious of the scenarios portrayed by the media about global warming , just look at the item on your newscasts today -lsb- dec .
13 -rsb- in which a group claims that sea turtles may die out if the beaches on which they lay their eggs are inundated by rising sea levels .
oddly , sea turtles have been around for tens of millions of years , and have survived several changes in sea level before , including one at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago .
the people making up these scenarios seem to have no idea of the geological past .
if they did , they would n't make such stupid claims , unnecessarily adding to the hysteria about the subject . - douglas ort , thailand denial is a natural human response when faced with very bad news or a serious prognosis - even when the evidence is beyond proof .
think back to the arrest and prosecution of galileo 300 years ago when he proved that the earth revolves around the sun .
it took a long while for humans to accept that their old beliefs were wrong .
it normally takes around 40 years for such a transition in belief to take place .
even the most brilliant brain ever - albert einstein - took some years to accept the theory of intercontinental drift , long after other scientists were convinced .
i have pity on those few remaining folks who are having trouble accepting the news -lsb- about climate change -rsb- , but i wo n't ridicule them any more than i would ridicule a person who can not accept the news that their loved one has deceased .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.12.2007 germans want to play larger global role , survey shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 46 percent of germans said they think germany will still be a world power in 2020 a new study shows that nearly half of germans see their country as a world power .
but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .
germany is not on a self-righteous , nationalistic course but , in fact , moving in the opposite direction . interview : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.12.2007 germans want to play larger global role , survey shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 46 percent of germans said they think germany will still be a world power in 2020 a new study shows that nearly half of germans see their country as a world power .
but that should n't be seen as a sign of growing german nationalism , the report 's author told dw-world.de and gave a different explanation . germany 's bertelsmann foundation commissioned and presented the results of the survey , titled " who rules the world , " this week .
the organization said its goal was to examine the public 's opinion of what defines a world power by polling 1,000 people in each of nine countries : brazil , china , france , germany , india , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states . in the decades since world war ii , germany has largely kept a low-profile in international affairs , and especially military deployments , but has begun to gain confidence on the world stage with more germans saying they should play a larger role in maintaining world peace and stability . the study 's author , stefani weiss , spoke with dw-world.de about the views of german respondents and the country 's growing sense of self-confidence on the international stage . dw-world.de : did the results surprise you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german exports in 2006 accounted for more than any other nation stefani weiss : yes , i have to say they did .
normally we think that we are reserved , but even the first study we did in 2005 shows that we have a healthy amount of self-confidence .
i think the main reason can be seen in other surveys , showing that germany is a strong export country and that its economy has been ranked third for a long time . in the nine countries surveyed , there was not a predominant notion of what defines a world power .
what were the most important characteristics for germans ? the survey shows that germans , more than other nations , do not see military strength as an important quality of a world power .
when you look at what qualities germans attribute to world powers , it comes down to political stability and economic strength .
when you put these two things together you can come to the opinion germans have of themselves . at the same time , it is downplayed a bit as well .
because of our past , we know there are historical accusations that germany tends towards megalomania .
but if you look at the study 's results in light of the qualities germans regard as traits of world powers , then germany - because of its gross national product and political stability - certainly belongs in that group . germans ' views of themselves as a world power increased from the 2005 study by 8 percent to 49 percent in 2007 .
do you think germany 's international role this year as president of both the european union and the group of eight shaped germans ' opinions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 presidency increased germans awareness of their role in the world , weiss said it certainly contributed to showing people in germany that we are responsible not only for ourselves , but that we also have a responsibility in the world .
for years there has been an accusation that germany is absorbed with itself , and i do not think this accusation can be made anymore . germans say that , after the un and the eu , they themselves should be the next ones taking on more international responsibility .
is there a feeling among germans that they are n't doing enough on an international level ? the accusation we 've had to answer most in the recent past is that we are doing too little .
that is a problem of germany 's history : whenever we begin getting involved someone is n't pleased .
we 've had a very hard time taking on responsibility outside of nato .
the mission to kosovo under -lsb- former german chancellor and foreign ministers -rsb- schröder and fischer was certainly difficult for germans , just as the continuing military and civil commitments in afghanistan are still regularly debated .
this is going on even as other states call on us to take on even more responsibility .
at the moment we are extremely reserved , and it is very , very difficult for us to commit ourselves .
i do n't see it as a bad signal when the german population is of the opinion that germany should contribute more . how does that fit with the response from germans that they want the united nations and european union to take on larger roles when it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has repeatedly asked germany to contribute more to missions in afghanistan it shows that the self-confidence that does exist is being tempered by multilateralism .
when it comes to shaping the world , germans are among the first to say they would like global governance and that the eu , in particular , should take on a bigger role . because germany gives precedence to the un and eu , i do n't think german self-confidence can be interpreted as new nationalistic course .
germany sees itself as a meaningful power in the realm of large powers , but still wants the world to be shaped by the un , and the region by the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.12.2007 opinion : reform treaty signed , but neither sealed nor delivered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders said the treaty of lisbon would be the basis for a more modern and democratic europe .
but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen if the reforms will meet with approval in the bloc 's 27 member states , says dw 's bernd riegert . the politicians ' speeches all sounded strangely similar .
a " historic day , " a " milestone , " a " new stage " and a " managed crisis : " all words that were used before at the signing of a treaty three years ago in rome .
that 's when the then 25 eu heads of government signed the eu constitution in a ceremony just as serious and solemn as in lisbon .
but everyone knows what happened to the constitution draft - it failed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it .
then a number of countries , including great britain and poland , developed fundamental aversions to the constitutional project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during two and a half years of painful discussions , a new eu treaty was created - a watered-down constitution that happens to be called the " treaty of lisbon " because portugal holds the rotating eu presidency .
the evaluations of the constitution signed in rome and the reform treaty signed in lisbon are the same .
now one can only hope that the " treaty " does n't meet the same fate as her big sister , the " constitution . " the reform treaty - or the treaty of changes , as the european council 's president for the first half of 2007 , germany 's angela merkel , called it - still has to be ratified by the bloc 's 27 member states within a year to become binding international legislation .
at the moment , it looks like only great britain could still cause problems .
the euro-skeptics there are vehemently calling for a referendum .
prime minister gordon brown wants to avoid one because he knows very well that his countrymen and women could reject the treaty .
they believe in a fairy tale of a european super-state that might be created by the treaty .
but actually all the state symbols , like a flag or anthem , have been explicitly struck from the text . the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , cited an old , but no less true , eu principle in lisbon : europeans have always emerged stronger from a crisis .
it 's true that the treaty of lisbon contains the tools to modernize the eu and fit the union 's growing size .
but it 's also true that the eu does n't make any of the long overdue statements about which direction the eu should be heading and where its borders possibly lie .
this debate is still pending .
french president nicolas sarkozy has announced that he wants to lead the debate during his council presidency in the second half of 2008 . the eternal dispute between the eu 's two camps - those who want to deepen ties and those who want to expand as quickly as possible - ca n't be decided .
not even the lisbon treaty will be able to do it .
the treaty is a milestone , but it will never be the keystone .
as in the past 50 years , the eu will develop - sometimes faster , sometimes slower - and the treaty of lisbon wo n't be the last one . but there is one consolation for euro-skeptics : for the first time , a treaty offers the possibility to leave the european union . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .
" food is neither a reward , nor a punishment , " she said , calling for web sites promoting incorrect ideals on weight to be closed down by their operators . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tight restrictions on international distribution indicate producers have hit a nerve among russia 's elite . rublyovka , the moscow street that serves as both the setting and the title of irene langemann 's new documentary , is a synonym for wealth , luxury and social divide in modern russia . it was there that josef stalin placed his lavish dachas in the 1930s and , since then , the 30-kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- stretch has been home to the russian upper-class - and , more recently , the businesspeople and politicians who profited practically overnight from post-communist capitalism . current president vladimir putin has a home on rublyovka , where houses go for anywhere from three to $ 20 million , along with billionaire roman abramowitsch and boris yeltsin 's daughter tatiana diatchenko . that would explain why the street is the most closely guarded place in a country that langemann said harkens back to soviet times . not only do putin and company live practically next door to those who did n't have quite as much luck during capitalism 's jump-start in the early 1990s , but the poor are essentially being pushed out .
as the coveted luxury plots become scarce , there have even been cases of arson when owners of modest homes on the road refused to turn them over to developers . director sheds -lrb- too much -rrb- light on putin 's russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langemann -lrb- center right -rrb- and her team were constantly hassled by police it is precisely that juxtaposition that russian-born filmmaker irene langemann set out to capture and convey in her documentary , which was produced by her husband wolfgang bergmann 's cologne-based film company lichtfilm . glimpses into the lives of art collector and philanthropist janna bullock , fur designer helen yarmak , the intelligent and politically skeptical 12-year-old roman romanov , and other rublyovka residents on both sides of the social fence take on a politically critical timbre in a country where democracy hangs by a thread . " the film gives a social portrait of today 's russia , where putin 's ' controlled democracy ' is taking on more and more dictatorial undertones , " said the lichtfilm web site . filming burdened by financing , red tape as is the case with most documentaries , funding was scarce and bergmann supplemented grants from the north rhine-westphalian film foundation , berlin-brandenburg radio and western german broadcaster wdr with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,000 -rrb- from his own pocket . langemann and her film crew spent over half a year obtaining permission from the traffic police , the kremlin security service , and the secret service - the successor of the kgb - to film on russia 's most prestigious site . they also had to disguise themselves as a purely russian film team and some scenes had to be filmed with a hidden camera , including an illegal shot of putin 's motorcade pulling out of his residence . police harassment , threats and kgb-like treatment continued throughout the filming process , which finally began in may 2006 , said langemann . russian millionaire halts film distribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film poster : putin as napoleon the real trouble came after the completion of the film , however , when bergmann and langemann were approached by russian millionaire and art collector alexander esin . in a meeting in a café near the frankfurt airport in september , esin offered 50,000 euros for the exclusive distribution rights to the film , with the exception of germany , france , austria and switzerland , where the rights had already been bought .
he said he wanted to found a documentary channel and thought " rublyovka " would make an ideal addition . " no one else would have given me so much money , " bergmann told spiegel magazine .
the film 's maker and producer were skeptical , but accepted the lucrative offer . instead of distributing the politically delicate film , esin has put the project on ice .
a month later , after " rublyovka " had met with success at festivals in munich and vienna , he demanded distribution rights in the four european countries where they had already been set , offering an additional 300,000 euros and support for langemann 's next three films in russia . when his bid was rejected , esin " turned into a cold snake -lrb- … -rrb- and said , ' you do n't know how difficult it 's become in russia to get permission to film , " ' langemann told spiegel . bildunterschrift : most russians do n't live like this film could damage putin 's popularity in an e-mail to lichtfilm , esin reportedly said he would address the distribution issue in february , which has led to the suspicion that his buying the rights is closely linked to an interest in protecting putin ahead of the presidential elections on march 2 . putin , whose two-term limit as president expires then , has already backed the candidacy of his ally dimitry medvedev as his successor .
the 42-year-old board chairman at gas giant gazprom and putin 's first deputy prime minister , in turn , offered putin the post of prime minister if he is elected president . images of not only the president 's opulent lifestyle but of those he brought to the upper social echelons , paralleled with scenes of poverty and simplicity , could damage putin 's reputation .

the organizers have enlisted some heavy-hitters to add weight to the crusade . if fat is a feminist issue , skinniness in now officially a political one .
the german government has taken a rare step into the breach by criticizing the fashion and advertising sectors for promoting ultra-thin models in their campaigns .
" skinny models belong neither on the catwalk nor in advertising , " health minister ulla schmidt said in berlin on thursday , dec .
13 , adding that that the fashion world had a responsibility to regulate itself in this regard .
schmidt , accompanied by family minister ursula von der leyen , education minister annette schavan and austrian family minister andrea kdolsky , was kicking off a campaign entitled " life has weight - together against slimming madness . "
increase in eating disorders prompts response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong image to promote ?
the government stance comes as data shows an alarming increase in eating disorders , particularly among girls and women in germany , which some observers have connected with the promotion of the waif-like body ethic in certain sections of the media .
a recent comprehensive survey by germany 's robert koch institute found that around 22 percent of youngsters aged 11 to 17 suffer from some form of eating disorder .
in boys , the rate then falls off , while among girls it rises to 30 percent at the age of 17 .
schmidt called the numbers " shocking , " while von der leyen said 90 percent of those affected by the body cult were girls or young women .
" anorexia is overwhelmingly female and it is very youthful , " she said .
taking a stand for her industry , alice schwarzer , founder and publisher of the german feminist magazine emma , is behind the campaign , which has now received the backing of the politicians .
" being thin should no longer be seen as chic , rather as a shock , " she said .
media and fashion sectors take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is one of the countries leading the fight against anorexia schwarzer called the skinny body cult a " mass psychosis of the west " and warned that germany was dragging its heels in the fight against compulsive slimming , with britain , italy and spain well ahead in countering it .
prominent german fashion designer jette joop said it was a " good idea " for the sector to commit itself to self-regulation .
health certificates for models were another possibility , she said .
schavan said that if the wrong images could have an effect on the behavior of women , then so could more natural images .
she appealed for more education and research into the effects .
von der leyen also called for the promotion of healthy eating in the home and in child care centers .

jan galbraith , warden of st mary 's in woodnesborough , near sandwich , said rain leaking into the church had damaged the organ .
" there 's certainly no carol service in woodnesborough this year , " she said .
the service will instead have to be held at st james the great church in nearby staple .
ms galbraith said : " we discovered when we had a great torrential downpour that some people had stolen the lead from our beautiful church , and we had a deluge of rain come in .
keeping thieves going is not one of the things our congregation expects to pay for jan galbraith " some rain has unfortunately caused damage to the organ which has got water inside .
" we can not use it until it dries out naturally , and then we shall have to see how much damage is there . "
plastic sheeting , newspapers and buckets are now a temporary feature of the church at st mary 's .
ms galbraith said : " our architect advises us it will cost £ 55,000 to replace what is missing .
" but we are a small parish and we rely very much on our growing congregation to pay for the needs of the church , but unfortunately keeping thieves going is not one of the things they expect to pay for .
