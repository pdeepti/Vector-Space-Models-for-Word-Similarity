dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .

21 elections won by ultra-nationalists and the unveiling last week of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo status proposal . the eu troika said they wanted to encourage serbian president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica to engage in the final phase of efforts to grant kosovo a new status , almost eight years since its interethnic war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy for kosovo martti ahtisaari " it 's important that they -lrb- the serbs -rrb- respond constructively , positively and on time to the proposal , " solana said . agreement could bring stability steinmeier said he was hoping that serbia would take part in the search for a compromise and that final talks about the status of kosovo could begin soon . " we are hoping for the decisiveness on the difficult issue of kosovo , " he said .
" it is now important that this agreement will create stability in the balkans . " solana said brussels was ready to conditionally accept belgrade 's request for a brief delay to the kosovo status , and sought to give serbia time to form a parliament and new kosovo talks team . in his draft report on kosovo 's final status delivered last week , ahtisaari avoided the word independence but was immediately criticized by belgrade for offering the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , security force , anthem , flag , and the ability to join international organizations . belgrade remains firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women protested outside while ahtisaari presented his draft plan though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . belgrade and most serbs see kosovo as the cradle of their nation 's history , culture and orthodox christian religion . " we need a minimal delay in order to form the parliament and take other necessary measures , " said kostunica , who renewed his strong opposition to kosovo 's independence . tadic , for his part , said he told the european leaders that kosovo 's independence was " unacceptable " but pledged to continue the talks " fully convinced that it is possible to change ahtisaari 's plan . " eu waiting for new government wednesday 's delicate talks between the eu and serbia also addressed the formation of a pro-western government following elections and the country 's lack of war crimes cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian radical party won january elections but did not get enough seats to govern in the polls , no single party emerged as the clear winner , leaving the country in political paralysis . the serbian radical party , which favors strong ties with traditional ally russia instead of the west , won the most votes but fell short of a parliamentary majority . " it will be very important for the -lrb- formation of the -rrb- government to take place as soon as possible , " solana said after meeting with kostunica , seen as the king-maker in coalition talks . " i was glad to hear that the prime minister is willing to make an effort ...
these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership . " it is important that the new government makes immediately a clear commitment to arrest all the fugitives and take concrete actions to that effect , " said rehn . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .

21 elections won by ultra-nationalists and the unveiling last week of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo status proposal . the eu troika said they wanted to encourage serbian president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica to engage in the final phase of efforts to grant kosovo a new status , almost eight years since its interethnic war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy for kosovo martti ahtisaari " it 's important that they -lrb- the serbs -rrb- respond constructively , positively and on time to the proposal , " solana said . agreement could bring stability steinmeier said he was hoping that serbia would take part in the search for a compromise and that final talks about the status of kosovo could begin soon . " we are hoping for the decisiveness on the difficult issue of kosovo , " he said .
" it is now important that this agreement will create stability in the balkans . " solana said brussels was ready to conditionally accept belgrade 's request for a brief delay to the kosovo status , and sought to give serbia time to form a parliament and new kosovo talks team . in his draft report on kosovo 's final status delivered last week , ahtisaari avoided the word independence but was immediately criticized by belgrade for offering the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , security force , anthem , flag , and the ability to join international organizations . belgrade remains firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women protested outside while ahtisaari presented his draft plan though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . belgrade and most serbs see kosovo as the cradle of their nation 's history , culture and orthodox christian religion . " we need a minimal delay in order to form the parliament and take other necessary measures , " said kostunica , who renewed his strong opposition to kosovo 's independence . tadic , for his part , said he told the european leaders that kosovo 's independence was " unacceptable " but pledged to continue the talks " fully convinced that it is possible to change ahtisaari 's plan . " eu waiting for new government wednesday 's delicate talks between the eu and serbia also addressed the formation of a pro-western government following elections and the country 's lack of war crimes cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian radical party won january elections but did not get enough seats to govern in the polls , no single party emerged as the clear winner , leaving the country in political paralysis . the serbian radical party , which favors strong ties with traditional ally russia instead of the west , won the most votes but fell short of a parliamentary majority . " it will be very important for the -lrb- formation of the -rrb- government to take place as soon as possible , " solana said after meeting with kostunica , seen as the king-maker in coalition talks . " i was glad to hear that the prime minister is willing to make an effort ...
these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership . " it is important that the new government makes immediately a clear commitment to arrest all the fugitives and take concrete actions to that effect , " said rehn . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .

21 elections won by ultra-nationalists and the unveiling last week of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo status proposal . the eu troika said they wanted to encourage serbian president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica to engage in the final phase of efforts to grant kosovo a new status , almost eight years since its interethnic war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy for kosovo martti ahtisaari " it 's important that they -lrb- the serbs -rrb- respond constructively , positively and on time to the proposal , " solana said . agreement could bring stability steinmeier said he was hoping that serbia would take part in the search for a compromise and that final talks about the status of kosovo could begin soon . " we are hoping for the decisiveness on the difficult issue of kosovo , " he said .
" it is now important that this agreement will create stability in the balkans . " solana said brussels was ready to conditionally accept belgrade 's request for a brief delay to the kosovo status , and sought to give serbia time to form a parliament and new kosovo talks team . in his draft report on kosovo 's final status delivered last week , ahtisaari avoided the word independence but was immediately criticized by belgrade for offering the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , security force , anthem , flag , and the ability to join international organizations . belgrade remains firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women protested outside while ahtisaari presented his draft plan though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . belgrade and most serbs see kosovo as the cradle of their nation 's history , culture and orthodox christian religion . " we need a minimal delay in order to form the parliament and take other necessary measures , " said kostunica , who renewed his strong opposition to kosovo 's independence . tadic , for his part , said he told the european leaders that kosovo 's independence was " unacceptable " but pledged to continue the talks " fully convinced that it is possible to change ahtisaari 's plan . " eu waiting for new government wednesday 's delicate talks between the eu and serbia also addressed the formation of a pro-western government following elections and the country 's lack of war crimes cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian radical party won january elections but did not get enough seats to govern in the polls , no single party emerged as the clear winner , leaving the country in political paralysis . the serbian radical party , which favors strong ties with traditional ally russia instead of the west , won the most votes but fell short of a parliamentary majority . " it will be very important for the -lrb- formation of the -rrb- government to take place as soon as possible , " solana said after meeting with kostunica , seen as the king-maker in coalition talks . " i was glad to hear that the prime minister is willing to make an effort ...
these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership . " it is important that the new government makes immediately a clear commitment to arrest all the fugitives and take concrete actions to that effect , " said rehn . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.02.2007 " justification for right-wing extremism is behind the scenes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young people do the deeds but the hate is rooted in the older generation , said heitmeyer the number of right-wing extremists and ethnically motivated crimes in germany has reached a six-year high .
dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .

a deal to end underground coal mining in germany was sealed on feb .
7 in berlin , with eight remaining pits to close by 2018 when the miners have reached retirement age . while opencast mining of lignite for power station furnaces is to continue , the extraction of hard coal from seams up to 2,000 meters deep will end , but not before subsidies of billions of euros have been paid in to the industry . broad consensus the deal was reached between the social democrats , who adamantly opposed any layoffs of miners , and the christian democratic union , which sees the subsidies as a waste of public money .
the industry absorbs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of state subsidies per year , which works out to 75,000 per job annually and more than a miner earns . under a last-minute amendment to a plan announced last week , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , where most of the deep mines are located , is to cease subsidies in 2015 , leaving the federal government to shoulder the load alone for the final three years . the state 's cdu premier jürgen rüttgers , and the german finance minister peer steinbrück , who must provide the extra funds , signed the accord after a day of talks in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must look to new energy sources miners unions welcomed the plan as the best they could achieve , as did the state-owned company rag , which runs the mines that gives the industry a prolonged and gentle demise .
rag is to be privatized and can likely look forward to a profitable future , as most environmental liabilities will be borne by the government . energy future questions coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic miracle . however , it 's become an economic drain - the price for a ton of quality coal for steelmaking on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 .
-lrb- 31.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.02.2007 " justification for right-wing extremism is behind the scenes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young people do the deeds but the hate is rooted in the older generation , said heitmeyer the number of right-wing extremists and ethnically motivated crimes in germany has reached a six-year high .
dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .
heitmeyer directs the institute for interdisciplinary conflict and violence research , which he founded in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right wing group sidelined in european parliament european parliamentarians have ditched normal procedures as a means of freezing out europe 's new extreme right group out of strasbourg 's positions of power .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .

the us is appealing for more troops and equipment to confront a growing threat from taliban insurgents in afghanistan . us defense secretary robert gates is expected to warn the nato defense ministers that time is running out to blunt the insurgency , with the taliban likely to mount a new offensive in the coming months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an expectant us defense secretary robert gates afghanistan 's lawless border regions with pakistan are a major haven for international terrorism , and the area where the taliban militia have regrouped supplies much of the opium that reaches europe . yet despite repeated calls over several months by nato commanders for more resources , the 26 member countries have appeared reluctant to put more of their forces in harm 's way . " we are saying to the allies all of us need to be prepared to blunt this and defeat it .
and now is the time to stand up to the military necessity .
waiting is n't going to help us , " said a senior official traveling with gates . " now 's the time to be ready to inflict a defeat on them , the offensive should be our offensive , " he said .
" that 's the philosophy we are communicating to the allies .

" " neither the secretary general nor general craddock are going to be handing around the begging bowl looking for contributions , " john colston , nato 's assistant secretary general for defense policy and planning , said on tuesday . yet last month , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said : " force generation will no doubt be discussed in seville . " a decisive year some 4,000 people were killed in the insurgency last year and us officials say suicide attacks have increased four-fold since 2005 .
in recent days , the taliban have held control of a town in southern helmand province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's government is too weak to control the taliban officials on both sides of the atlantic have insisted that 2007 is a decisive year to defeat the taliban , ousted from power in late 2001 for harboring osama bin laden , and push ahead with reconstruction . if nato fails to spread the influence of president hamid karzai 's weak central government throughout the country and revive the economy , ordinary afghans could turn back to the fundamentalist militia . the way the afghan mission - nato 's most ambitious ever - plays out could indeed determine the future of the 60-year-old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat operations , or just peacekeeping and reconstruction . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " some regions can only be secured by force " on wednesday the german cabinet agreed to propose using bundeswehr tornados to help nato combat the taliban in southern afghanistan .

" ukraine will abide by its duties in the energy sector , " yushchenko said on thursday after meeting with merkel .
" ukraine is conscious of the responsibility to ensure a steady flow of energy to western europe . " the german chancellor , whose nation currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said she supported kiev 's call for a treaty on closer cooperation with the eu , adding that berlin backed the process of reforms and economic transformation in the ukraine . in a reference to a cut-off in gas supplies a year ago and more recent arguments between ukraine and russia over gas transport , she said the eu had an interest in receiving a reliable energy supply . " i have no doubt that a lot of effort is going in this direction , " merkel said . ukrainian reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is embroiled in a power struggle between pro-russian and pro-western forces merkel urged yushchenko to give his full backing to talks on binding the former soviet state and the european union closer together . " we want to work towards a fuller cooperation agreement with ukraine to make it clear that we want to strengthen ties that are already strong , " merkel said . " we want to do everything possible to ensure that the process of democratization and transformation in ukraine continues successfully , " she added . negotiations on the accord began on tuesday , with germany playing a major role as the current holder of the six-month rotating eu presidency . still no eu membership talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take time before ukraine can join the eu the partnership and cooperation agreement with ukraine will replace a treaty signed in 1998 , which is due to expire next year .
it will allow stronger cooperation on security policy , justice issues , gas and oil transit and visa policy as well expanding free trade between ukraine and the 27-member european bloc . ukraine has expressed disappointment that the agreement does not automatically open the door to eu membership . but yushchenko said he had " no doubt " that ukraine would " eventually be part of the structures of the eu . " a parliamentary ban earlier this week , ukraine 's parliament adopted a law putting a stopper on all transactions on ukrainian gas pipelines , after moscow suggested uniting russian and ukrainian gas assets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control over ukraine 's gas system is essential for russia the new law won overwhelming approval , with 430 lawmakers out of a total 450 voting in favor , and must now be signed by yushchenko to come into force , the interfax news agency reported . the document bans all " reorganization , fusion , attachment , division " and " privatization " of ukrainian gas pipelines , also outlawing the alienation or concession of their assets . russian president vladimir putin 's idea to " unite the -lrb- gas -rrb- assets " of the two countries in exchange for ukraine 's access to gas production in russia sparked mixed feelings in ukraine . control over ukraine 's gas system is essential for russia , which has 80 percent of its gas exports to europe transported by way of its western neighbor . the pro-western yushchenko was reserved in noting his russian counterpart 's project , saying that it was too early to consider it . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , ukraine launch negotiations on bolstering ties the european union and ukraine have kicked off negotiations on a new partnership agreement .

21 elections won by ultra-nationalists and the unveiling last week of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo status proposal . the eu troika said they wanted to encourage serbian president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica to engage in the final phase of efforts to grant kosovo a new status , almost eight years since its interethnic war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy for kosovo martti ahtisaari " it 's important that they -lrb- the serbs -rrb- respond constructively , positively and on time to the proposal , " solana said . agreement could bring stability steinmeier said he was hoping that serbia would take part in the search for a compromise and that final talks about the status of kosovo could begin soon . " we are hoping for the decisiveness on the difficult issue of kosovo , " he said .
" it is now important that this agreement will create stability in the balkans . " solana said brussels was ready to conditionally accept belgrade 's request for a brief delay to the kosovo status , and sought to give serbia time to form a parliament and new kosovo talks team . in his draft report on kosovo 's final status delivered last week , ahtisaari avoided the word independence but was immediately criticized by belgrade for offering the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , security force , anthem , flag , and the ability to join international organizations . belgrade remains firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women protested outside while ahtisaari presented his draft plan though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . belgrade and most serbs see kosovo as the cradle of their nation 's history , culture and orthodox christian religion . " we need a minimal delay in order to form the parliament and take other necessary measures , " said kostunica , who renewed his strong opposition to kosovo 's independence . tadic , for his part , said he told the european leaders that kosovo 's independence was " unacceptable " but pledged to continue the talks " fully convinced that it is possible to change ahtisaari 's plan . " eu waiting for new government wednesday 's delicate talks between the eu and serbia also addressed the formation of a pro-western government following elections and the country 's lack of war crimes cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian radical party won january elections but did not get enough seats to govern in the polls , no single party emerged as the clear winner , leaving the country in political paralysis . the serbian radical party , which favors strong ties with traditional ally russia instead of the west , won the most votes but fell short of a parliamentary majority . " it will be very important for the -lrb- formation of the -rrb- government to take place as soon as possible , " solana said after meeting with kostunica , seen as the king-maker in coalition talks . " i was glad to hear that the prime minister is willing to make an effort ...
these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership . " it is important that the new government makes immediately a clear commitment to arrest all the fugitives and take concrete actions to that effect , " said rehn . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .

21 elections won by ultra-nationalists and the unveiling last week of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo status proposal . the eu troika said they wanted to encourage serbian president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica to engage in the final phase of efforts to grant kosovo a new status , almost eight years since its interethnic war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy for kosovo martti ahtisaari " it 's important that they -lrb- the serbs -rrb- respond constructively , positively and on time to the proposal , " solana said . agreement could bring stability steinmeier said he was hoping that serbia would take part in the search for a compromise and that final talks about the status of kosovo could begin soon . " we are hoping for the decisiveness on the difficult issue of kosovo , " he said .
" it is now important that this agreement will create stability in the balkans . " solana said brussels was ready to conditionally accept belgrade 's request for a brief delay to the kosovo status , and sought to give serbia time to form a parliament and new kosovo talks team . in his draft report on kosovo 's final status delivered last week , ahtisaari avoided the word independence but was immediately criticized by belgrade for offering the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , security force , anthem , flag , and the ability to join international organizations . belgrade remains firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women protested outside while ahtisaari presented his draft plan though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . belgrade and most serbs see kosovo as the cradle of their nation 's history , culture and orthodox christian religion . " we need a minimal delay in order to form the parliament and take other necessary measures , " said kostunica , who renewed his strong opposition to kosovo 's independence . tadic , for his part , said he told the european leaders that kosovo 's independence was " unacceptable " but pledged to continue the talks " fully convinced that it is possible to change ahtisaari 's plan . " eu waiting for new government wednesday 's delicate talks between the eu and serbia also addressed the formation of a pro-western government following elections and the country 's lack of war crimes cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian radical party won january elections but did not get enough seats to govern in the polls , no single party emerged as the clear winner , leaving the country in political paralysis . the serbian radical party , which favors strong ties with traditional ally russia instead of the west , won the most votes but fell short of a parliamentary majority . " it will be very important for the -lrb- formation of the -rrb- government to take place as soon as possible , " solana said after meeting with kostunica , seen as the king-maker in coalition talks . " i was glad to hear that the prime minister is willing to make an effort ...
these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership . " it is important that the new government makes immediately a clear commitment to arrest all the fugitives and take concrete actions to that effect , " said rehn . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .

the us is appealing for more troops and equipment to confront a growing threat from taliban insurgents in afghanistan . us defense secretary robert gates is expected to warn the nato defense ministers that time is running out to blunt the insurgency , with the taliban likely to mount a new offensive in the coming months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an expectant us defense secretary robert gates afghanistan 's lawless border regions with pakistan are a major haven for international terrorism , and the area where the taliban militia have regrouped supplies much of the opium that reaches europe . yet despite repeated calls over several months by nato commanders for more resources , the 26 member countries have appeared reluctant to put more of their forces in harm 's way . " we are saying to the allies all of us need to be prepared to blunt this and defeat it .

" " neither the secretary general nor general craddock are going to be handing around the begging bowl looking for contributions , " john colston , nato 's assistant secretary general for defense policy and planning , said on tuesday . yet last month , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said : " force generation will no doubt be discussed in seville . " a decisive year some 4,000 people were killed in the insurgency last year and us officials say suicide attacks have increased four-fold since 2005 .

" we have a vital interest in the stabilization of afghanistan , " kasuri said after a meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin . kasuri said a fence would stop militants crossing the mountainous 2,500-kilometer -lrb- 1,500-mile -rrb- border , but pakistan would like assistance from the european union to realize the project . both ministers agreed about the importance of securing the afghan border . " we must improve the safety of pakistan 's border with afghanistan and curb illegal border-crossings , " steinmeier said . eu cooperation in afghanistan was one of the issues kasuri discussed with the german foreign minister , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union . other topics included pakistan 's trade relations with the eu , combating the illegal drug trade and the fight against terrorism , steinmeier said . a joint commission a joint declaration issued after the talks said the first meeting of the eu-pakistan joint commission , set up under a cooperation agreement signed in 2004 , would be held in the pakistani capital of islamabad later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between pakistan and afghanistan is often crossed by terrorist groups kasuri said the control of pakistan 's frontier with afghanistan was of major importance for bringing stability to its neighbor , where remnants of the ousted taliban regime are battling nato-led forces . " pakistan has offered to entirely fence the border , " kasuri said .
" in fact we wanted to mine the border so that there would be no movement across the border , but as a mark of respect to the sensitivities of our european colleagues , we have decided that we will not mine the border for the time being .

this could show that it would be better for the environment to build the pipeline above ground , kollatz-ahnen said . the eib 's comment came just a day after germany 's former chancellor gerhard schröder - now head of the supervisory board of the russian-german consortium in charge of building the undersea pipeline - promoted the controversial project in brussels . schröder said the baltic sea pipe would bolster eu energy security without damaging the environment . gazprom plans to seek eib funding to help meet the costs of the 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- scheme . eib invests in massive projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is chairman of the consortium building the disputed pipeline the planned pipeline is to ship 27.5 billion cubic meters of the fuel annually from russia 's arctic shkotman deposit to germany . the eib also called for talks with banks in china , warning that chinese loans to african countries could undermine european efforts to improve governance standards in african states and could put the poor continent in excessive debt . in 2006 , the eib lent a total of 45.8 billion euros for projects mainly in the area of infrastructure and research and development . while the overall spending is likely to stay the same this year , the eib said it plans to drive up lending on energy projects by 1 billion euros to 4 billion euros in 2007 .

" these plans are tasteless , arrogant and a slap in the face for all those who lost their job , " ig metall union spokesman georgios arwanitidis told thursday 's edition of the daily berliner zeitung . the same paper quoted rainer brüderle from the free-market liberal fdp party as saying , " it is understandable that the employees who have just been sacked are outraged by this news . " benq mobile - formerly the mobile phone business of german electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq in 2005 - filed for insolvency at the end of september . some 2,000 people , who used to be employed by benq mobile in germany , have been out of work since jan .

they were laid off in an attempt to safeguard the remaining 1,000 jobs at the insolvent company , which in the past 12 months made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- . a hefty deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 2008 tournament will be held in austria and switzerland on monday , benq was unveiled as the fourth official sponsor for euro 2008 to be played in austria and switzerland , joining adidas , castrol and continental .
the company was also a sponsor of euro 2004 and is shirt sponsor of spanish club real madrid . the latest deal is said to be worth at least 15 million euros , with others naming figures between 30 million and 40 million euros . " if benq wants to make an image campaign , it can start here in kamt-lintfort by spending the same sum they are giving uefa on the creation of new jobs , " ig metall official ulrich marschner from the former benq mobile plant in western german kamp-lintfort told the neue rhein / neue ruhr zeitung . court proceedings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless an eleventh-hour buyer is found , benq mobile will be completely shut down the news of euro 2008 's sponsorship deal with the taiwanese company came less then a week after insolvency proceedings were opened against benq mobile in germany . after the court-appointed administrator martin prager failed to find a buyer for the company , a court in munich said that benq 's production operations in munich and kamp-lintfort would be shut down . a spokeswoman for the munich court said it was still possible that an investor could take over part of the operation during the insolvency proceedings . according to reports , some 500 benq mobile employees have already found positions elsewhere .
if an 11th-hour buyer does n't turn up , the remaining 2,500 can receive a portion of their paycheck for up to a year , paid for by a state-sponsored transitional employment agency , until they can be placed in other jobs . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens chief promises full explanation of bribery scandal managers at siemens faced angry shareholders at the annual meeting here on thursday , as the venerable german electronics giant battles a crisis over a string of corruption allegations .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .
" a clear statement , " the paper continued , before adding that there had been plenty of clear - and contradictory - statements from other politicians . spd parliamentary leader , and former defense minister , peter struck , for example .

" politicians ambiguous but german not ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if parliament approves , six to eight jets manned by some 500 soldiers would be sent " so is it a war mission or not ? , " the tagesspiegel questioned .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .
" a clear statement , " the paper continued , before adding that there had been plenty of clear - and contradictory - statements from other politicians . spd parliamentary leader , and former defense minister , peter struck , for example .
he told bonn 's general anzeiger , " it 's a war mission anyways . " politicians ambiguous but german not ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if parliament approves , six to eight jets manned by some 500 soldiers would be sent " so is it a war mission or not ? , " the tagesspiegel questioned .
" probably both are right somehow .
jung , when he says that the tornados wo n't directly intervene in the fighting with their canons .
struck , when he says that the overall mission in afghanistan is a war mission .
it just gets a bit complicated when the government means two different things with the same word . " die welt commented that the tornados " would not alter the character of the existing mission . "
the daily wrote that since it 's not chancing the tone of army 's mission , sending the jets is a simple decision .
" the government 's decision to send the jets is practically a matter of course , " die welt wrote .
" they will contribute to improving reconnaissance in the hindu kush for the bundeswehr , its threatened allies and the civilian population .
even more than that : it underlines the fact that germany is n't ambivalent to the fate of its partners . " an unavoidable fight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans said reconstruction needs to remain the focus " a little bit pregnant " was the title of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung 's commentary on the tornado decision .
" behind all the efforts to limit the tornados ' task and not let it look like a war mission is the hope of being a little bit pregnant in international politics , " the faz opined .
" participating in what is considered an unavoidable fight -lrb- for the closest allies -rrb- against transnational terrorism and its supporters without having to get one 's own hands too dirty , or even burn them . "
the paper then concluded that , " in afghanistan they are going to survey the enemy so that he can be fought against . " the leipziger volkszeitung took up the issue of germany 's responsibility as a nato member .
" the tornado decision is a reaction to pressure from brussels and washington , but it 's also a necessary consequence of solidarity with the alliance , " the daily commented , adding that it would be irresponsible to leave the country in the hindu kush to the mercy of the taliban .

these range from dumping toxic waste to unsafe transport of hazardous materials , harming protected plants or species , and unlawful trade in ozone-depleting substances . intentional crimes punished heavily the heaviest sentence - at least five to 10 years of jail - would apply to crimes committed intentionally that killed or seriously injured people .

" ukraine will abide by its duties in the energy sector , " yushchenko said on thursday after meeting with merkel .
" ukraine is conscious of the responsibility to ensure a steady flow of energy to western europe . " the german chancellor , whose nation currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said she supported kiev 's call for a treaty on closer cooperation with the eu , adding that berlin backed the process of reforms and economic transformation in the ukraine . in a reference to a cut-off in gas supplies a year ago and more recent arguments between ukraine and russia over gas transport , she said the eu had an interest in receiving a reliable energy supply . " i have no doubt that a lot of effort is going in this direction , " merkel said . ukrainian reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is embroiled in a power struggle between pro-russian and pro-western forces merkel urged yushchenko to give his full backing to talks on binding the former soviet state and the european union closer together . " we want to work towards a fuller cooperation agreement with ukraine to make it clear that we want to strengthen ties that are already strong , " merkel said . " we want to do everything possible to ensure that the process of democratization and transformation in ukraine continues successfully , " she added . negotiations on the accord began on tuesday , with germany playing a major role as the current holder of the six-month rotating eu presidency . still no eu membership talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take time before ukraine can join the eu the partnership and cooperation agreement with ukraine will replace a treaty signed in 1998 , which is due to expire next year .
it will allow stronger cooperation on security policy , justice issues , gas and oil transit and visa policy as well expanding free trade between ukraine and the 27-member european bloc . ukraine has expressed disappointment that the agreement does not automatically open the door to eu membership . but yushchenko said he had " no doubt " that ukraine would " eventually be part of the structures of the eu . " a parliamentary ban earlier this week , ukraine 's parliament adopted a law putting a stopper on all transactions on ukrainian gas pipelines , after moscow suggested uniting russian and ukrainian gas assets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control over ukraine 's gas system is essential for russia the new law won overwhelming approval , with 430 lawmakers out of a total 450 voting in favor , and must now be signed by yushchenko to come into force , the interfax news agency reported . the document bans all " reorganization , fusion , attachment , division " and " privatization " of ukrainian gas pipelines , also outlawing the alienation or concession of their assets . russian president vladimir putin 's idea to " unite the -lrb- gas -rrb- assets " of the two countries in exchange for ukraine 's access to gas production in russia sparked mixed feelings in ukraine . control over ukraine 's gas system is essential for russia , which has 80 percent of its gas exports to europe transported by way of its western neighbor . the pro-western yushchenko was reserved in noting his russian counterpart 's project , saying that it was too early to consider it . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , ukraine launch negotiations on bolstering ties the european union and ukraine have kicked off negotiations on a new partnership agreement .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .

but the us continued to push for tough european action . european countries will use informal contacts with top iranian negotiator ali larijani at a security conference this weekend to try to defuse the crisis over iran 's atomic ambitions , diplomats said . the goal is to get iran " to come up with some realistic , achievable proposals " to meet the un 's demand for it to suspend uranium enrichment , a european diplomat told afp news service in vienna , where the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is headquartered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei has his work cut out for him on the iran nukes issue the crisis is at a clear standoff as iran rejects the un security council resolution of dec .
23 which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium .
enriched uranium makes fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors but also explosive material for atom bombs . switzerland plays ' water-carrier ' role this process is at the heart of us charges that iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons behind what tehran claims is a peaceful energy program . a second diplomat said switzerland was " playing a secret role to carry some water and find countries that want to seek common ground with iran and use carrots and not just sticks , " referring to offering iran benefits if it were to freeze enrichment work . germany would also lead this initiative , at the conference on security policy being held in munich from friday to sunday , diplomats said . france , britain in backseat britain and france , germany 's partners in the eu-3 line up that has negotiated with iran , were taking a harder line .
they want to see iran first take the step of ceasing uranium enrichment , the diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin wants to combine talk with action in iran but french prime minister dominique de villepin told the financial times on tuesday that the west " must combine dialogue with firmness in our approach -lrb- to iran -rrb- .
i think the us and europe can go further in dialogue and proposals . " the security council could impose tougher sanctions if a report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei later this month shows tehran continuing to defy the security council . message for larijani the message in munich will be " very clear " as the europeans will urge larijani to have iran " re-engage -lrb- with the international community -rrb- .
do n't dig yourself deeper in the famous hole , " one diplomat said . on monday , larijani told iran 's isna news agency that he hoped to have " good talks and negotiations , " in munich . but in a sign the stalemate is not about to end anytime soon , he ruled out meeting with us officials on the sidelines of the event . like the davos economic forum , the munich meeting gathers key world leaders in a framework that favors informal contacts . new us defense secretary robert gates will be there , as well as russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor angela merkel and european union foreign policy chief javier solana , who led the eu 's now-stalled talks with iran . no breakthrough expected the european diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said : " i do n't expect breakthroughs from that meeting -lrb- with larijani -rrb- .
this is hopefully a chance to sound out feelers and not more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , led the eu 's now-stalled talks with iran speaking to a conference in munich , us ambassador to the iaea gregory schulte warned of possible " additional measures " against iran if that country continued to deny security council demands to stop uranium enrichment . he praised the eu for swiftly implementing the un resolution banning trade in nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology .
but he once again said europeans could do more , including ending credits subsidizing exports to iran and taking other measures to discourage investment . " a non-military campaign , if serious and sustained , and supported by other like-minded countries , has the potential to succeed against a regime that … needs foreign investment to sustain government revenue . " but he added that whatever they do , the us and europe must avoid looking like the west is on a new " crusade " against muslim countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

a deal to end underground coal mining in germany was sealed on feb .
7 in berlin , with eight remaining pits to close by 2018 when the miners have reached retirement age . while opencast mining of lignite for power station furnaces is to continue , the extraction of hard coal from seams up to 2,000 meters deep will end , but not before subsidies of billions of euros have been paid in to the industry . broad consensus the deal was reached between the social democrats , who adamantly opposed any layoffs of miners , and the christian democratic union , which sees the subsidies as a waste of public money .
the industry absorbs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of state subsidies per year , which works out to 75,000 per job annually and more than a miner earns . under a last-minute amendment to a plan announced last week , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , where most of the deep mines are located , is to cease subsidies in 2015 , leaving the federal government to shoulder the load alone for the final three years . the state 's cdu premier jürgen rüttgers , and the german finance minister peer steinbrück , who must provide the extra funds , signed the accord after a day of talks in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must look to new energy sources miners unions welcomed the plan as the best they could achieve , as did the state-owned company rag , which runs the mines that gives the industry a prolonged and gentle demise .
rag is to be privatized and can likely look forward to a profitable future , as most environmental liabilities will be borne by the government . energy future questions coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic miracle . however , it 's become an economic drain - the price for a ton of quality coal for steelmaking on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 .
-lrb- 31.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .
-lrb- 16.12.2006 -rrb- germany breaks ground on first non-polluting coal power plant as global energy demands increase , the need for clean sources of power has become crucial .
on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases .

but the us continued to push for tough european action . european countries will use informal contacts with top iranian negotiator ali larijani at a security conference this weekend to try to defuse the crisis over iran 's atomic ambitions , diplomats said . the goal is to get iran " to come up with some realistic , achievable proposals " to meet the un 's demand for it to suspend uranium enrichment , a european diplomat told afp news service in vienna , where the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is headquartered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei has his work cut out for him on the iran nukes issue the crisis is at a clear standoff as iran rejects the un security council resolution of dec .
23 which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium .
enriched uranium makes fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors but also explosive material for atom bombs . switzerland plays ' water-carrier ' role this process is at the heart of us charges that iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons behind what tehran claims is a peaceful energy program . a second diplomat said switzerland was " playing a secret role to carry some water and find countries that want to seek common ground with iran and use carrots and not just sticks , " referring to offering iran benefits if it were to freeze enrichment work . germany would also lead this initiative , at the conference on security policy being held in munich from friday to sunday , diplomats said . france , britain in backseat britain and france , germany 's partners in the eu-3 line up that has negotiated with iran , were taking a harder line .
they want to see iran first take the step of ceasing uranium enrichment , the diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin wants to combine talk with action in iran but french prime minister dominique de villepin told the financial times on tuesday that the west " must combine dialogue with firmness in our approach -lrb- to iran -rrb- .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .
heitmeyer directs the institute for interdisciplinary conflict and violence research , which he founded in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right wing group sidelined in european parliament european parliamentarians have ditched normal procedures as a means of freezing out europe 's new extreme right group out of strasbourg 's positions of power .

this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .

it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .
" a clear statement , " the paper continued , before adding that there had been plenty of clear - and contradictory - statements from other politicians . spd parliamentary leader , and former defense minister , peter struck , for example .
he told bonn 's general anzeiger , " it 's a war mission anyways . " politicians ambiguous but german not ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if parliament approves , six to eight jets manned by some 500 soldiers would be sent " so is it a war mission or not ? , " the tagesspiegel questioned .
" probably both are right somehow .
jung , when he says that the tornados wo n't directly intervene in the fighting with their canons .
struck , when he says that the overall mission in afghanistan is a war mission .
it just gets a bit complicated when the government means two different things with the same word . " die welt commented that the tornados " would not alter the character of the existing mission . "
the daily wrote that since it 's not chancing the tone of army 's mission , sending the jets is a simple decision .
" the government 's decision to send the jets is practically a matter of course , " die welt wrote .
" they will contribute to improving reconnaissance in the hindu kush for the bundeswehr , its threatened allies and the civilian population .
even more than that : it underlines the fact that germany is n't ambivalent to the fate of its partners . " an unavoidable fight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans said reconstruction needs to remain the focus " a little bit pregnant " was the title of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung 's commentary on the tornado decision .
" behind all the efforts to limit the tornados ' task and not let it look like a war mission is the hope of being a little bit pregnant in international politics , " the faz opined .
" participating in what is considered an unavoidable fight -lrb- for the closest allies -rrb- against transnational terrorism and its supporters without having to get one 's own hands too dirty , or even burn them . "
the paper then concluded that , " in afghanistan they are going to survey the enemy so that he can be fought against . " the leipziger volkszeitung took up the issue of germany 's responsibility as a nato member .
" the tornado decision is a reaction to pressure from brussels and washington , but it 's also a necessary consequence of solidarity with the alliance , " the daily commented , adding that it would be irresponsible to leave the country in the hindu kush to the mercy of the taliban .

" ukraine will abide by its duties in the energy sector , " yushchenko said on thursday after meeting with merkel .
" ukraine is conscious of the responsibility to ensure a steady flow of energy to western europe . " the german chancellor , whose nation currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said she supported kiev 's call for a treaty on closer cooperation with the eu , adding that berlin backed the process of reforms and economic transformation in the ukraine . in a reference to a cut-off in gas supplies a year ago and more recent arguments between ukraine and russia over gas transport , she said the eu had an interest in receiving a reliable energy supply . " i have no doubt that a lot of effort is going in this direction , " merkel said . ukrainian reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is embroiled in a power struggle between pro-russian and pro-western forces merkel urged yushchenko to give his full backing to talks on binding the former soviet state and the european union closer together . " we want to work towards a fuller cooperation agreement with ukraine to make it clear that we want to strengthen ties that are already strong , " merkel said .

21 elections won by ultra-nationalists and the unveiling last week of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo status proposal . the eu troika said they wanted to encourage serbian president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica to engage in the final phase of efforts to grant kosovo a new status , almost eight years since its interethnic war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy for kosovo martti ahtisaari " it 's important that they -lrb- the serbs -rrb- respond constructively , positively and on time to the proposal , " solana said . agreement could bring stability steinmeier said he was hoping that serbia would take part in the search for a compromise and that final talks about the status of kosovo could begin soon . " we are hoping for the decisiveness on the difficult issue of kosovo , " he said .
" it is now important that this agreement will create stability in the balkans . " solana said brussels was ready to conditionally accept belgrade 's request for a brief delay to the kosovo status , and sought to give serbia time to form a parliament and new kosovo talks team . in his draft report on kosovo 's final status delivered last week , ahtisaari avoided the word independence but was immediately criticized by belgrade for offering the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , security force , anthem , flag , and the ability to join international organizations . belgrade remains firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women protested outside while ahtisaari presented his draft plan though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . belgrade and most serbs see kosovo as the cradle of their nation 's history , culture and orthodox christian religion . " we need a minimal delay in order to form the parliament and take other necessary measures , " said kostunica , who renewed his strong opposition to kosovo 's independence . tadic , for his part , said he told the european leaders that kosovo 's independence was " unacceptable " but pledged to continue the talks " fully convinced that it is possible to change ahtisaari 's plan . " eu waiting for new government wednesday 's delicate talks between the eu and serbia also addressed the formation of a pro-western government following elections and the country 's lack of war crimes cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian radical party won january elections but did not get enough seats to govern in the polls , no single party emerged as the clear winner , leaving the country in political paralysis . the serbian radical party , which favors strong ties with traditional ally russia instead of the west , won the most votes but fell short of a parliamentary majority . " it will be very important for the -lrb- formation of the -rrb- government to take place as soon as possible , " solana said after meeting with kostunica , seen as the king-maker in coalition talks . " i was glad to hear that the prime minister is willing to make an effort ...
these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership .

a deal to end underground coal mining in germany was sealed on feb .
7 in berlin , with eight remaining pits to close by 2018 when the miners have reached retirement age . while opencast mining of lignite for power station furnaces is to continue , the extraction of hard coal from seams up to 2,000 meters deep will end , but not before subsidies of billions of euros have been paid in to the industry . broad consensus the deal was reached between the social democrats , who adamantly opposed any layoffs of miners , and the christian democratic union , which sees the subsidies as a waste of public money .
the industry absorbs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of state subsidies per year , which works out to 75,000 per job annually and more than a miner earns . under a last-minute amendment to a plan announced last week , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , where most of the deep mines are located , is to cease subsidies in 2015 , leaving the federal government to shoulder the load alone for the final three years . the state 's cdu premier jürgen rüttgers , and the german finance minister peer steinbrück , who must provide the extra funds , signed the accord after a day of talks in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must look to new energy sources miners unions welcomed the plan as the best they could achieve , as did the state-owned company rag , which runs the mines that gives the industry a prolonged and gentle demise .
rag is to be privatized and can likely look forward to a profitable future , as most environmental liabilities will be borne by the government . energy future questions coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic miracle . however , it 's become an economic drain - the price for a ton of quality coal for steelmaking on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .

we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .

but the us continued to push for tough european action . european countries will use informal contacts with top iranian negotiator ali larijani at a security conference this weekend to try to defuse the crisis over iran 's atomic ambitions , diplomats said . the goal is to get iran " to come up with some realistic , achievable proposals " to meet the un 's demand for it to suspend uranium enrichment , a european diplomat told afp news service in vienna , where the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is headquartered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei has his work cut out for him on the iran nukes issue the crisis is at a clear standoff as iran rejects the un security council resolution of dec .
23 which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium .
enriched uranium makes fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors but also explosive material for atom bombs . switzerland plays ' water-carrier ' role this process is at the heart of us charges that iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons behind what tehran claims is a peaceful energy program . a second diplomat said switzerland was " playing a secret role to carry some water and find countries that want to seek common ground with iran and use carrots and not just sticks , " referring to offering iran benefits if it were to freeze enrichment work . germany would also lead this initiative , at the conference on security policy being held in munich from friday to sunday , diplomats said . france , britain in backseat britain and france , germany 's partners in the eu-3 line up that has negotiated with iran , were taking a harder line .

but the us continued to push for tough european action . european countries will use informal contacts with top iranian negotiator ali larijani at a security conference this weekend to try to defuse the crisis over iran 's atomic ambitions , diplomats said . the goal is to get iran " to come up with some realistic , achievable proposals " to meet the un 's demand for it to suspend uranium enrichment , a european diplomat told afp news service in vienna , where the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is headquartered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei has his work cut out for him on the iran nukes issue the crisis is at a clear standoff as iran rejects the un security council resolution of dec .
23 which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium .
enriched uranium makes fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors but also explosive material for atom bombs . switzerland plays ' water-carrier ' role this process is at the heart of us charges that iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons behind what tehran claims is a peaceful energy program . a second diplomat said switzerland was " playing a secret role to carry some water and find countries that want to seek common ground with iran and use carrots and not just sticks , " referring to offering iran benefits if it were to freeze enrichment work . germany would also lead this initiative , at the conference on security policy being held in munich from friday to sunday , diplomats said . france , britain in backseat britain and france , germany 's partners in the eu-3 line up that has negotiated with iran , were taking a harder line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.02.2007 " justification for right-wing extremism is behind the scenes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young people do the deeds but the hate is rooted in the older generation , said heitmeyer the number of right-wing extremists and ethnically motivated crimes in germany has reached a six-year high .
dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .

another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .

but the us continued to push for tough european action . european countries will use informal contacts with top iranian negotiator ali larijani at a security conference this weekend to try to defuse the crisis over iran 's atomic ambitions , diplomats said . the goal is to get iran " to come up with some realistic , achievable proposals " to meet the un 's demand for it to suspend uranium enrichment , a european diplomat told afp news service in vienna , where the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is headquartered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei has his work cut out for him on the iran nukes issue the crisis is at a clear standoff as iran rejects the un security council resolution of dec .

enriched uranium makes fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors but also explosive material for atom bombs . switzerland plays ' water-carrier ' role this process is at the heart of us charges that iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons behind what tehran claims is a peaceful energy program . a second diplomat said switzerland was " playing a secret role to carry some water and find countries that want to seek common ground with iran and use carrots and not just sticks , " referring to offering iran benefits if it were to freeze enrichment work . germany would also lead this initiative , at the conference on security policy being held in munich from friday to sunday , diplomats said . france , britain in backseat britain and france , germany 's partners in the eu-3 line up that has negotiated with iran , were taking a harder line .
they want to see iran first take the step of ceasing uranium enrichment , the diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin wants to combine talk with action in iran but french prime minister dominique de villepin told the financial times on tuesday that the west " must combine dialogue with firmness in our approach -lrb- to iran -rrb- .
i think the us and europe can go further in dialogue and proposals . " the security council could impose tougher sanctions if a report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei later this month shows tehran continuing to defy the security council . message for larijani the message in munich will be " very clear " as the europeans will urge larijani to have iran " re-engage -lrb- with the international community -rrb- .

they were laid off in an attempt to safeguard the remaining 1,000 jobs at the insolvent company , which in the past 12 months made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- . a hefty deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 2008 tournament will be held in austria and switzerland on monday , benq was unveiled as the fourth official sponsor for euro 2008 to be played in austria and switzerland , joining adidas , castrol and continental .
the company was also a sponsor of euro 2004 and is shirt sponsor of spanish club real madrid . the latest deal is said to be worth at least 15 million euros , with others naming figures between 30 million and 40 million euros .

if an 11th-hour buyer does n't turn up , the remaining 2,500 can receive a portion of their paycheck for up to a year , paid for by a state-sponsored transitional employment agency , until they can be placed in other jobs . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens chief promises full explanation of bribery scandal managers at siemens faced angry shareholders at the annual meeting here on thursday , as the venerable german electronics giant battles a crisis over a string of corruption allegations .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .

" the government 's decision to send the jets is practically a matter of course , " die welt wrote .
" they will contribute to improving reconnaissance in the hindu kush for the bundeswehr , its threatened allies and the civilian population .

the paper then concluded that , " in afghanistan they are going to survey the enemy so that he can be fought against . " the leipziger volkszeitung took up the issue of germany 's responsibility as a nato member .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .
" a clear statement , " the paper continued , before adding that there had been plenty of clear - and contradictory - statements from other politicians . spd parliamentary leader , and former defense minister , peter struck , for example .

" politicians ambiguous but german not ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if parliament approves , six to eight jets manned by some 500 soldiers would be sent " so is it a war mission or not ? , " the tagesspiegel questioned .

jung , when he says that the tornados wo n't directly intervene in the fighting with their canons .
struck , when he says that the overall mission in afghanistan is a war mission .
it just gets a bit complicated when the government means two different things with the same word . " die welt commented that the tornados " would not alter the character of the existing mission . "
the daily wrote that since it 's not chancing the tone of army 's mission , sending the jets is a simple decision .
" the government 's decision to send the jets is practically a matter of course , " die welt wrote .
" they will contribute to improving reconnaissance in the hindu kush for the bundeswehr , its threatened allies and the civilian population .
even more than that : it underlines the fact that germany is n't ambivalent to the fate of its partners . " an unavoidable fight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans said reconstruction needs to remain the focus " a little bit pregnant " was the title of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung 's commentary on the tornado decision .

" participating in what is considered an unavoidable fight -lrb- for the closest allies -rrb- against transnational terrorism and its supporters without having to get one 's own hands too dirty , or even burn them . "
the paper then concluded that , " in afghanistan they are going to survey the enemy so that he can be fought against . " the leipziger volkszeitung took up the issue of germany 's responsibility as a nato member .
" the tornado decision is a reaction to pressure from brussels and washington , but it 's also a necessary consequence of solidarity with the alliance , " the daily commented , adding that it would be irresponsible to leave the country in the hindu kush to the mercy of the taliban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 08.02.2007 us to prod nato allies for more troops to defeat taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's ambitious afghan mission could determine the future of the alliance nato defense ministers gathered thursday in seville , southern spain , for two days of informal talks .
the us is appealing for more troops and equipment to confront a growing threat from taliban insurgents in afghanistan . us defense secretary robert gates is expected to warn the nato defense ministers that time is running out to blunt the insurgency , with the taliban likely to mount a new offensive in the coming months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an expectant us defense secretary robert gates afghanistan 's lawless border regions with pakistan are a major haven for international terrorism , and the area where the taliban militia have regrouped supplies much of the opium that reaches europe . yet despite repeated calls over several months by nato commanders for more resources , the 26 member countries have appeared reluctant to put more of their forces in harm 's way . " we are saying to the allies all of us need to be prepared to blunt this and defeat it .
and now is the time to stand up to the military necessity .
waiting is n't going to help us , " said a senior official traveling with gates . " now 's the time to be ready to inflict a defeat on them , the offensive should be our offensive , " he said .
" that 's the philosophy we are communicating to the allies . " new requirements nato 's new military chief us general bantz craddock , who along with gates faces a baptism of fire in his first official meeting , is to present the allies with a new list of military requirements for the nato-led force in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's border with pakistan is a terrorist haven craddock is expected to call for three more battalions for the 35,000-strong international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which nato has led since 2003 and which has assumed responsibility for security across afghanistan . ahead of the talks , germany said it planned to send six reconnaissance jets to afghanistan , although not in a combat role , while britain said it expects to have 800 more troops in place by the afghan summer . these offers came after a us offer at nato headquarters on january 26 to provide 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in aid over the next two years and keep more than 3,000 troops already in afghanistan there for an extra four months . an embarrassment for the alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is sending tornados to afghanistan the slowness shown by many allies has embarrassed nato in past meetings , and before these talks officials insisted that the meeting here would not be about " force generation . " " neither the secretary general nor general craddock are going to be handing around the begging bowl looking for contributions , " john colston , nato 's assistant secretary general for defense policy and planning , said on tuesday . yet last month , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said : " force generation will no doubt be discussed in seville . " a decisive year some 4,000 people were killed in the insurgency last year and us officials say suicide attacks have increased four-fold since 2005 .
in recent days , the taliban have held control of a town in southern helmand province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's government is too weak to control the taliban officials on both sides of the atlantic have insisted that 2007 is a decisive year to defeat the taliban , ousted from power in late 2001 for harboring osama bin laden , and push ahead with reconstruction . if nato fails to spread the influence of president hamid karzai 's weak central government throughout the country and revive the economy , ordinary afghans could turn back to the fundamentalist militia . the way the afghan mission - nato 's most ambitious ever - plays out could indeed determine the future of the 60-year-old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat operations , or just peacekeeping and reconstruction . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " some regions can only be secured by force " on wednesday the german cabinet agreed to propose using bundeswehr tornados to help nato combat the taliban in southern afghanistan .
dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision .
-lrb- 08.02.2007 -rrb- german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .

" new requirements nato 's new military chief us general bantz craddock , who along with gates faces a baptism of fire in his first official meeting , is to present the allies with a new list of military requirements for the nato-led force in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's border with pakistan is a terrorist haven craddock is expected to call for three more battalions for the 35,000-strong international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which nato has led since 2003 and which has assumed responsibility for security across afghanistan . ahead of the talks , germany said it planned to send six reconnaissance jets to afghanistan , although not in a combat role , while britain said it expects to have 800 more troops in place by the afghan summer . these offers came after a us offer at nato headquarters on january 26 to provide 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in aid over the next two years and keep more than 3,000 troops already in afghanistan there for an extra four months . an embarrassment for the alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is sending tornados to afghanistan the slowness shown by many allies has embarrassed nato in past meetings , and before these talks officials insisted that the meeting here would not be about " force generation . " " neither the secretary general nor general craddock are going to be handing around the begging bowl looking for contributions , " john colston , nato 's assistant secretary general for defense policy and planning , said on tuesday . yet last month , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said : " force generation will no doubt be discussed in seville . " a decisive year some 4,000 people were killed in the insurgency last year and us officials say suicide attacks have increased four-fold since 2005 .
in recent days , the taliban have held control of a town in southern helmand province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's government is too weak to control the taliban officials on both sides of the atlantic have insisted that 2007 is a decisive year to defeat the taliban , ousted from power in late 2001 for harboring osama bin laden , and push ahead with reconstruction . if nato fails to spread the influence of president hamid karzai 's weak central government throughout the country and revive the economy , ordinary afghans could turn back to the fundamentalist militia . the way the afghan mission - nato 's most ambitious ever - plays out could indeed determine the future of the 60-year-old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat operations , or just peacekeeping and reconstruction . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " some regions can only be secured by force " on wednesday the german cabinet agreed to propose using bundeswehr tornados to help nato combat the taliban in southern afghanistan .

21 elections won by ultra-nationalists and the unveiling last week of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo status proposal . the eu troika said they wanted to encourage serbian president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica to engage in the final phase of efforts to grant kosovo a new status , almost eight years since its interethnic war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy for kosovo martti ahtisaari " it 's important that they -lrb- the serbs -rrb- respond constructively , positively and on time to the proposal , " solana said . agreement could bring stability steinmeier said he was hoping that serbia would take part in the search for a compromise and that final talks about the status of kosovo could begin soon . " we are hoping for the decisiveness on the difficult issue of kosovo , " he said .
" it is now important that this agreement will create stability in the balkans . " solana said brussels was ready to conditionally accept belgrade 's request for a brief delay to the kosovo status , and sought to give serbia time to form a parliament and new kosovo talks team . in his draft report on kosovo 's final status delivered last week , ahtisaari avoided the word independence but was immediately criticized by belgrade for offering the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , security force , anthem , flag , and the ability to join international organizations . belgrade remains firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women protested outside while ahtisaari presented his draft plan though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . belgrade and most serbs see kosovo as the cradle of their nation 's history , culture and orthodox christian religion . " we need a minimal delay in order to form the parliament and take other necessary measures , " said kostunica , who renewed his strong opposition to kosovo 's independence . tadic , for his part , said he told the european leaders that kosovo 's independence was " unacceptable " but pledged to continue the talks " fully convinced that it is possible to change ahtisaari 's plan . " eu waiting for new government wednesday 's delicate talks between the eu and serbia also addressed the formation of a pro-western government following elections and the country 's lack of war crimes cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian radical party won january elections but did not get enough seats to govern in the polls , no single party emerged as the clear winner , leaving the country in political paralysis . the serbian radical party , which favors strong ties with traditional ally russia instead of the west , won the most votes but fell short of a parliamentary majority . " it will be very important for the -lrb- formation of the -rrb- government to take place as soon as possible , " solana said after meeting with kostunica , seen as the king-maker in coalition talks . " i was glad to hear that the prime minister is willing to make an effort ...
these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership . " it is important that the new government makes immediately a clear commitment to arrest all the fugitives and take concrete actions to that effect , " said rehn . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .

" these plans are tasteless , arrogant and a slap in the face for all those who lost their job , " ig metall union spokesman georgios arwanitidis told thursday 's edition of the daily berliner zeitung . the same paper quoted rainer brüderle from the free-market liberal fdp party as saying , " it is understandable that the employees who have just been sacked are outraged by this news . " benq mobile - formerly the mobile phone business of german electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq in 2005 - filed for insolvency at the end of september . some 2,000 people , who used to be employed by benq mobile in germany , have been out of work since jan .

the company was also a sponsor of euro 2004 and is shirt sponsor of spanish club real madrid . the latest deal is said to be worth at least 15 million euros , with others naming figures between 30 million and 40 million euros .

if an 11th-hour buyer does n't turn up , the remaining 2,500 can receive a portion of their paycheck for up to a year , paid for by a state-sponsored transitional employment agency , until they can be placed in other jobs . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens chief promises full explanation of bribery scandal managers at siemens faced angry shareholders at the annual meeting here on thursday , as the venerable german electronics giant battles a crisis over a string of corruption allegations .

a 16-year-old german girl has been sentenced to two weeks in prison for repeatedly skipping school .
the case put a new twist on the concept of serving detention . " whaddya gonna do , arrest me ? " it 's a common last-ditch comment made by moody teens looking to get out of a sticky situation . but in the case of a 16-year-old habitually truant teen from görlitz , in eastern germany , the answer was , " er , yeah . " after the schoolgirl failed to show up for a healthy portion of her government mandated education last year , the education ministry in the eastern german state of saxony , as well as the courts , were called into the fray . but it was n't until the girl 's parents refused to pay a fine for their daughter 's truancy , and the teen herself turned her nose up at working off the fine via community service , the court , it seems , was left with no recourse . it sentenced her to two weeks in prison . what can you learn locked up ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : showing up is a prerequisite for taking part a spokeswoman for the education ministry in dresden said she did not want to comment on the court decision . but a greens party politician pointed out that in this case , the punishment was far from fitting the crime . " i wonder what a school girl is expected to learn in prison , " astrid günther-schmidt , parliamentary party speaker for education issues , told the dpa news service . moreover , schmidt pointed out that normally , fines against truancy are paid by the parents .

" we have a vital interest in the stabilization of afghanistan , " kasuri said after a meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin . kasuri said a fence would stop militants crossing the mountainous 2,500-kilometer -lrb- 1,500-mile -rrb- border , but pakistan would like assistance from the european union to realize the project . both ministers agreed about the importance of securing the afghan border . " we must improve the safety of pakistan 's border with afghanistan and curb illegal border-crossings , " steinmeier said . eu cooperation in afghanistan was one of the issues kasuri discussed with the german foreign minister , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union . other topics included pakistan 's trade relations with the eu , combating the illegal drug trade and the fight against terrorism , steinmeier said . a joint commission a joint declaration issued after the talks said the first meeting of the eu-pakistan joint commission , set up under a cooperation agreement signed in 2004 , would be held in the pakistani capital of islamabad later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between pakistan and afghanistan is often crossed by terrorist groups kasuri said the control of pakistan 's frontier with afghanistan was of major importance for bringing stability to its neighbor , where remnants of the ousted taliban regime are battling nato-led forces . " pakistan has offered to entirely fence the border , " kasuri said .

" these plans are tasteless , arrogant and a slap in the face for all those who lost their job , " ig metall union spokesman georgios arwanitidis told thursday 's edition of the daily berliner zeitung . the same paper quoted rainer brüderle from the free-market liberal fdp party as saying , " it is understandable that the employees who have just been sacked are outraged by this news . " benq mobile - formerly the mobile phone business of german electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq in 2005 - filed for insolvency at the end of september . some 2,000 people , who used to be employed by benq mobile in germany , have been out of work since jan .

the company was also a sponsor of euro 2004 and is shirt sponsor of spanish club real madrid . the latest deal is said to be worth at least 15 million euros , with others naming figures between 30 million and 40 million euros .

if an 11th-hour buyer does n't turn up , the remaining 2,500 can receive a portion of their paycheck for up to a year , paid for by a state-sponsored transitional employment agency , until they can be placed in other jobs . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens chief promises full explanation of bribery scandal managers at siemens faced angry shareholders at the annual meeting here on thursday , as the venerable german electronics giant battles a crisis over a string of corruption allegations .

a deal to end underground coal mining in germany was sealed on feb .
7 in berlin , with eight remaining pits to close by 2018 when the miners have reached retirement age . while opencast mining of lignite for power station furnaces is to continue , the extraction of hard coal from seams up to 2,000 meters deep will end , but not before subsidies of billions of euros have been paid in to the industry . broad consensus the deal was reached between the social democrats , who adamantly opposed any layoffs of miners , and the christian democratic union , which sees the subsidies as a waste of public money .
the industry absorbs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of state subsidies per year , which works out to 75,000 per job annually and more than a miner earns . under a last-minute amendment to a plan announced last week , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , where most of the deep mines are located , is to cease subsidies in 2015 , leaving the federal government to shoulder the load alone for the final three years . the state 's cdu premier jürgen rüttgers , and the german finance minister peer steinbrück , who must provide the extra funds , signed the accord after a day of talks in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must look to new energy sources miners unions welcomed the plan as the best they could achieve , as did the state-owned company rag , which runs the mines that gives the industry a prolonged and gentle demise .
rag is to be privatized and can likely look forward to a profitable future , as most environmental liabilities will be borne by the government . energy future questions coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic miracle . however , it 's become an economic drain - the price for a ton of quality coal for steelmaking on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 .
-lrb- 31.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .
-lrb- 16.12.2006 -rrb- germany breaks ground on first non-polluting coal power plant as global energy demands increase , the need for clean sources of power has become crucial .
on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases .

-lrb- 31.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.02.2007 " justification for right-wing extremism is behind the scenes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young people do the deeds but the hate is rooted in the older generation , said heitmeyer the number of right-wing extremists and ethnically motivated crimes in germany has reached a six-year high .
dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .
heitmeyer directs the institute for interdisciplinary conflict and violence research , which he founded in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right wing group sidelined in european parliament european parliamentarians have ditched normal procedures as a means of freezing out europe 's new extreme right group out of strasbourg 's positions of power .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .
since 1982 , his primary research interests have included right-wing extremism , violence , xenophobia , ethnic-cultural conflict , social disintegration and , more recently , hostility against particular social groups .
heitmeyer directs the institute for interdisciplinary conflict and violence research , which he founded in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right wing group sidelined in european parliament european parliamentarians have ditched normal procedures as a means of freezing out europe 's new extreme right group out of strasbourg 's positions of power .
-lrb- 02.02.2007 -rrb- germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 08.02.2007 german press review : " a little bit pregnant " in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german papers took the chance to define the word " combat " in editorials on thursday germany 's cabinet voted this week to send tornado jets to southern afghanistan to assist the nato mission with reconnaissance .
while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .
" a clear statement , " the paper continued , before adding that there had been plenty of clear - and contradictory - statements from other politicians . spd parliamentary leader , and former defense minister , peter struck , for example .
he told bonn 's general anzeiger , " it 's a war mission anyways . " politicians ambiguous but german not ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if parliament approves , six to eight jets manned by some 500 soldiers would be sent " so is it a war mission or not ? , " the tagesspiegel questioned .
" probably both are right somehow .
jung , when he says that the tornados wo n't directly intervene in the fighting with their canons .
struck , when he says that the overall mission in afghanistan is a war mission .
it just gets a bit complicated when the government means two different things with the same word . " die welt commented that the tornados " would not alter the character of the existing mission . "
the daily wrote that since it 's not chancing the tone of army 's mission , sending the jets is a simple decision .
" the government 's decision to send the jets is practically a matter of course , " die welt wrote .
" they will contribute to improving reconnaissance in the hindu kush for the bundeswehr , its threatened allies and the civilian population .
even more than that : it underlines the fact that germany is n't ambivalent to the fate of its partners . " an unavoidable fight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans said reconstruction needs to remain the focus " a little bit pregnant " was the title of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung 's commentary on the tornado decision .
" behind all the efforts to limit the tornados ' task and not let it look like a war mission is the hope of being a little bit pregnant in international politics , " the faz opined .
" participating in what is considered an unavoidable fight -lrb- for the closest allies -rrb- against transnational terrorism and its supporters without having to get one 's own hands too dirty , or even burn them . "
the paper then concluded that , " in afghanistan they are going to survey the enemy so that he can be fought against . " the leipziger volkszeitung took up the issue of germany 's responsibility as a nato member .
" the tornado decision is a reaction to pressure from brussels and washington , but it 's also a necessary consequence of solidarity with the alliance , " the daily commented , adding that it would be irresponsible to leave the country in the hindu kush to the mercy of the taliban .

these are difficult times , " solana added . brussels hopes reformists led by tadic 's pro-european democratic party and kostunica 's moderate nationalist democratic party of serbia will be able to form a new government . war crime persecution brussels suspended rapprochement talks last year with belgrade for a lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court , notably its failure to fulfill a promise to arrest genocide suspect ratko mladic . eu enlargement chief rehn hinted at a more flexible approach from brussels on war crimes . " the new government can make a new start , " rehn said when asked how belgrade could resume negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , seen as the first step to eventual eu membership . " it is important that the new government makes immediately a clear commitment to arrest all the fugitives and take concrete actions to that effect , " said rehn . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .

but the us continued to push for tough european action . european countries will use informal contacts with top iranian negotiator ali larijani at a security conference this weekend to try to defuse the crisis over iran 's atomic ambitions , diplomats said . the goal is to get iran " to come up with some realistic , achievable proposals " to meet the un 's demand for it to suspend uranium enrichment , a european diplomat told afp news service in vienna , where the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is headquartered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei has his work cut out for him on the iran nukes issue the crisis is at a clear standoff as iran rejects the un security council resolution of dec .
23 which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium .
enriched uranium makes fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors but also explosive material for atom bombs . switzerland plays ' water-carrier ' role this process is at the heart of us charges that iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons behind what tehran claims is a peaceful energy program . a second diplomat said switzerland was " playing a secret role to carry some water and find countries that want to seek common ground with iran and use carrots and not just sticks , " referring to offering iran benefits if it were to freeze enrichment work . germany would also lead this initiative , at the conference on security policy being held in munich from friday to sunday , diplomats said . france , britain in backseat britain and france , germany 's partners in the eu-3 line up that has negotiated with iran , were taking a harder line .
they want to see iran first take the step of ceasing uranium enrichment , the diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin wants to combine talk with action in iran but french prime minister dominique de villepin told the financial times on tuesday that the west " must combine dialogue with firmness in our approach -lrb- to iran -rrb- .
i think the us and europe can go further in dialogue and proposals . " the security council could impose tougher sanctions if a report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei later this month shows tehran continuing to defy the security council . message for larijani the message in munich will be " very clear " as the europeans will urge larijani to have iran " re-engage -lrb- with the international community -rrb- .
do n't dig yourself deeper in the famous hole , " one diplomat said . on monday , larijani told iran 's isna news agency that he hoped to have " good talks and negotiations , " in munich . but in a sign the stalemate is not about to end anytime soon , he ruled out meeting with us officials on the sidelines of the event . like the davos economic forum , the munich meeting gathers key world leaders in a framework that favors informal contacts . new us defense secretary robert gates will be there , as well as russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor angela merkel and european union foreign policy chief javier solana , who led the eu 's now-stalled talks with iran . no breakthrough expected the european diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said : " i do n't expect breakthroughs from that meeting -lrb- with larijani -rrb- .
this is hopefully a chance to sound out feelers and not more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , led the eu 's now-stalled talks with iran speaking to a conference in munich , us ambassador to the iaea gregory schulte warned of possible " additional measures " against iran if that country continued to deny security council demands to stop uranium enrichment . he praised the eu for swiftly implementing the un resolution banning trade in nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology .
but he once again said europeans could do more , including ending credits subsidizing exports to iran and taking other measures to discourage investment . " a non-military campaign , if serious and sustained , and supported by other like-minded countries , has the potential to succeed against a regime that … needs foreign investment to sustain government revenue . " but he added that whatever they do , the us and europe must avoid looking like the west is on a new " crusade " against muslim countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .

dw-world.de spoke with social expert wilhelm heitmeyer about why that is . dw-world.de : how would you explain the increase in the number of right-wing extremists and xenophobic crimes in germany ? wilhelm heitmeyer : these activities have increased in some places but , on the other hand , people 's awareness has also changed .
another important factor is that particular attitude patterns in the population legitimate violence when they are seen as normal .
that 's why it 's important to separate acts of violence from the social climate .
another point is that resistance is becoming quieter and quieter , especially in eastern germany . why is it important to observe these attitude patterns in germany ? we determined in the course of our long-term research that migration , particularly in small towns , has an affect because it 's the younger , well educated people who are leaving .
the result is greater homogeneity in people 's attitude patterns .
counter movements do n't disappear completely but they may become quieter .
that 's something we can document .
in regions where the economic trend is negative , we find more pejorative attitudes toward weaker groups than in prosperous regions .
it 's not a coincidence that groups like the npd -lrb- far-right national democratic party -rrb- are calling for greater action in the economically weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic trends can affect attitudes toward other social groups , said heitmeyer is eastern germany 's history relevant to explanations for right-wing extremism that have to do with east-west discrepancies ? there is certainly a connection between authoritarian attitudes and the devaluation of foreigners .
on the other hand , the younger generation has grown up in a united germany .
we should examine more closely if it does n't have to do with the fears of this new society .
accepting democracy is debatable for some , which has to do with the economic recession a few years ago .
in contrast , the west got to know democracy during a time of economic recovery . will the current economic boom contribute to improvements in the social climate , as far as xenophobic tendencies are concerned ? that 's a big question mark .
the economic success is n't evenly distributed .
it can have the opposite effect when people in the weaker areas realize that the boom has passed them by .
but so far these are just hypotheses . in addition to economic downturn in certain regions , does lack of education also play a role ? of course .
when the well educated people leave the regions where they no longer see possibilities for themselves , the political culture changes there as well .
this is a problem for structurally weak areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education level is also a factor in xenophobic attitudes do some of the people who have stayed behind in these structurally weak areas project their own discontentment on foreigners ?
or how do xenophobic attitudes develop ? on one hand , many people fear social disintegration .
if you add disorientation to the mix - " what kind of society are we living in actually and which rules apply here ? " - then discrimination against certain groups can arise .
devaluation of others serves to boost one 's own self-worth .
here it 's important to differentiate between people 's personal opinions and active groups .
acts of violence are mostly committed by young people , but the hostile attitude patterns are really behind the scenes - with the older generation .
they provide the justification .
this influence is often underestimated , which is why the society does n't respond to it . before the 2006 soccer world cup , there was controversy over so-called " no-go " areas in germany - that is , places where foreign-looking people should n't go .
has this discussion had any lasting effects ? it 's hard to say , but the term " no-go " areas should be reconsidered .
it 's more about " fear zones , " some of which are stabile , others of which quickly disappear . could the discussion have had a negative effect , in that it carved out territories for right-wing extremists ? this can happen , which makes the discussion ambivalent , but it 's also an appeal to say we 're not just going to let things stay as they are , we 're not going to keep quiet about the fact that certain groups of people are publicly being robbed of their freedom .
at the same time , it 's a call to action , especially for government intervention programs .
we do n't just need new projects where plenty of activities are already going on , but also there where right-wing groups are dominant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are disillusioned with democracy and germany 's cdu-spd grand coalition what can the government do in response to the increase in right-wing extremist and xenophobic crimes ? first of all , the government has to work together with the police and the justice system .
but repression always breeds innovation .
right-wing extremist groups create their own private structures , which makes it more difficult for the state to intervene .
however , not just the government but many parties are responsible for society 's condition - from the economic sphere , the press and ordinary people standing up for their beliefs , to social movements that take to the streets .
the state acting alone can make politicians even more confrontational than they already are - which i see as quite alarming , considering the current " drain of democracy " that 's taking place . is there still a danger of a " democracy drain " even while the grand coalition is in power ? it has been discussed so much that it 's no longer clear in which direction society should develop .
the grand coalition is getting bogged down in details that hardly anyone understands , like with the health care reforms .
a discussion should be started about what kind of society we want to live in anyways .
we observe so much disorientation among the people because many rules for how this society should function seem to have been overridden .
just think about the horrendous profits of large companies and at the same time there are mass lay-offs .
no one understands it - and that makes people turn away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm heitmeyer wilhelm heitmeyer , 62 , is professor of pedagogy -lrb- with an emphasis on socialization -rrb- at the university of bielefeld .

it is the eu commission 's second-ever foray into individual governments ' criminal law . the european commission said in a draft paper that it wants to punish the most serious " green crimes " against the environment with 5-10 year minimum jail terms and fines of up to 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 1.9 million -rrb- , the euobserver internet news service reported . the draft paper called for " more dissuasive sanctions for environmentally harmful activities , which typically cause or are likely to cause substantial damage to the air , soil , water , animals or plants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oil spill off the coast of spain led to some dirty birds overall , the eu commission is seeking minimum sentences for nine offenses .
these range from dumping toxic waste to unsafe transport of hazardous materials , harming protected plants or species , and unlawful trade in ozone-depleting substances . intentional crimes punished heavily the heaviest sentence - at least five to 10 years of jail - would apply to crimes committed intentionally that killed or seriously injured people .
other offenses would be punished by at least one to three years in prison . the proposal marks the second time in eu legal history that brussels proposes national governments will no longer have the full sovereign right to decide what constitutes a crime and what the punishment should be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear power plant in france the first precedent dates back to may , 2006 , when common rules on counterfeiting were put on the table by the brussels executive body . ' green crime ' on the rise the commission , which is due to adopt the proposal on friday , says " green crimes " are on the rise , increasingly causing cross-border damage , and that eu states ' measures are insufficient to stop them . member states and the european parliament must approve the draft directive for it to take effect , overriding national laws .
it touches on the sensitive issue of the division of powers between national and eu law over criminal penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing harm to endangered species would be punished " in order to achieve effective protection of the environment , there is a particular need for more dissuasive sanctions for environmentally harmful activities , " the draft proposal said . it said measures taken by the bloc 's 27 states individually are insufficient and vary too much , allowing companies to shop around for the most lenient legislation in the borderless bloc . but its proposal prompted some angry reactions . greenpeace in favor " the european commission is using the environmental agenda as an excuse to massively increase its powers at the expense of national parliaments .
this is a very slippery slope , " british conservative eu lawmaker syed kamall told reuters news service . but environmental group greenpeace welcomed the move . " it 's certainly an improvement on the current situation , some member states only have administrative fines , " spokeswoman katharine mill said . she urged the bloc to go further , however , saying the proposed fines were too low and the scope of the proposal should be wider , to include for instance import of illegal timber . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland could lose eu funds for environment breaches protecting areas of significant biodiversity is one of the obligations for new eu members .
however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects .

while the parliament is deciding , the german press is questioning the nature of the mission . until now , germany has focused on reconstruction efforts in northern afghanistan and maintained its non-combat position .
the government 's recent decision to send tornado jets to the south , where fighting has been more intense , has led some to question the essence of germany 's mandate and whether fighter jets doing reconnaissance is compatible with a reconstruction mandate . berlin 's tagesspiegel recalled that germany 's politicians have n't helped to clear up the matter .
" ' reconnaissance is n't a war mission , " it quoted defense minister franz-josef jung as saying .

" these plans are tasteless , arrogant and a slap in the face for all those who lost their job , " ig metall union spokesman georgios arwanitidis told thursday 's edition of the daily berliner zeitung . the same paper quoted rainer brüderle from the free-market liberal fdp party as saying , " it is understandable that the employees who have just been sacked are outraged by this news . " benq mobile - formerly the mobile phone business of german electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq in 2005 - filed for insolvency at the end of september . some 2,000 people , who used to be employed by benq mobile in germany , have been out of work since jan .

if an 11th-hour buyer does n't turn up , the remaining 2,500 can receive a portion of their paycheck for up to a year , paid for by a state-sponsored transitional employment agency , until they can be placed in other jobs . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens chief promises full explanation of bribery scandal managers at siemens faced angry shareholders at the annual meeting here on thursday , as the venerable german electronics giant battles a crisis over a string of corruption allegations .

a recent government report shows that muslims in india are even more disadvantaged than low-caste hindus .
it says a high rate of unemployment and lack of education has led to a decline in their socio-economic standards .
india and pakistan have the largest muslim populations in the world , after indonesia .
a new confidential report prepared by the planning commission , based on data from the census department , says a majority of muslims live in towns and cities of india .
' hunting ground ' it says around 700 of india 's 5,161 towns have substantial numbers of muslim residents .
the report says muslims have a relatively higher urban population and many live in urban slums where they have no access to basic needs of housing , education , health and employment .
these areas of " deprivation and discontent " are " happy hunting grounds " for disgruntled groups inside and outside india , it warns .
most of these muslim-majority towns are close to the international border and the coastline and can lead to security problems for the country , it adds .
the report asks the government to ensure that development schemes are started in these areas to " ensure palpable results in the next two years " .
the issue of special development schemes for muslims is a controversial one with the opposition hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party questioning it .
bjp leader shahnawaz hussain told the bbc , " the congress party governed india for 50 years and did little for muslims .
the latest moves are politically motivated , " he said .
in the run-up to the federal budget due later this month , the government commissioned an expert committee report on ways to improve educational skills of muslims .
' distress ' a group of mostly academics , headed by maa fatmi - a junior minister in prime minister manmohan singh 's government - submitted its report on tuesday .
the fatmi committee was asked to suggest how to implement the recommendations of sachar committee , which was set up in march 2005 to review the state of indian muslims .
the sachar committee submitted its report in november last year .
the report said india 's muslims were poorer and less educated and suffered from higher unemployment and greater mortality than other religious groups a committee member , vice-chancellor of hyderabad university seyed e hasnain , told the bbc that " specific measures have been recommended " but no time-frame has been suggested for their implementation india 's centre-left federal government has focused a lot of attention on the plight of muslims since it won the 2004 general elections .
prime minister singh has lost no opportunity to address the muslim constituency in the country and has promised to improve their condition .
soon after coming to power he spoke of his " distress " at the low representation of muslims in government as well as in private sector jobs .
last year , he urged state chief ministers to recruit " more muslims into the police and intelligence agencies " to help counter a growing sense of insecurity in the community .
mr singh 's remarks that muslims " must have the first claim on resources " landed him in a lot of controversy .
his later attempts to retract from that statement did not in any way stop the bjp from accusing his government of trying to " appease " the muslims for electoral gains .

the retailer , which is using fresh and easy as its brand name for its us venture , said it had secured 20 sites in the greater phoenix area .
other outlets in los angeles and san diego will open later this year .
tesco is targeting us grocers like 7-eleven and locally-run stores using a chain of convenience stores modelled on the tesco express blueprint .
the phoenix area was selected because of rapid growth in the region , tesco said , predicting 2,500 jobs would be created by the first wave of openings .
tough market " the fresh & easy neighbourhood market format is designed to draw customers back to their local neighbourhoods by offering high quality , fresh and nutritious food at affordable prices , " said tim mason , head of tesco in the us .
" our company has enjoyed strong success in countries throughout europe and asia , and we are excited to bring that success to america . "
however , the us market is notoriously tough for uk businesses .
top retailers sainsbury 's and marks & spencer have failed to crack the tastes of the us consumer and both have withdrawn back across the atlantic .
having the us in its sights helped tesco to attract a £ 734m investment from stock market guru warren buffett .
the investment by his berkshire hathaway company is seen as a key endorsement of tesco 's expansion strategy by market analysts .
but tesco has attracted fierce criticism for the impact its stores have on small local outlets in the uk .
the uk 's competition commission is engaged in a study into the fall-out from the growth of tesco and other large grocery chains .
tesco sees overseas investment as the key to corporate growth .
it has 155 outlets in thailand and has just opened its first store in beijing .

bombing middle england , which is made from acrylic and spray-paint on canvas , reached double its highest estimated price of £ 50,000 at sotheby 's .
the artist 's balloon girl also sold for £ 37,200 , while another piece called bomb hugger fetched £ 31,200 .
but a rare signed artwork , precision bomber , failed to sell .
' sensational result ' the previous highest price paid for one of the artist 's distinctive spray paintings was £ 62,400 in october 2006 , when the image of a couple embracing clad in deep sea diving gear - which was used for the cover of blur 's think tank album - went for 10 times its estimated value at bonhams .
" it 's a sensational result , " said elli varnavides , head of the impressionist , modern and contemporary art department at sotheby 's olympia branch .
" it 's a record for any banksy sold at international auction . "
another sale at sotheby 's new bond street auction house raised £ 45.7m on wednesday evening .
sotheby 's said the total was a record for a contemporary art sale in europe .
the highest priced lot was white canoe by british artist peter doig , which was bought by an anonymous bidder for £ 5.7m , a record for the artist .
other sales included gerard richter 's abstraktes bild which went for £ 2.8m and roy lichtenstein 's still life with oysters , fish in a bowl and book , which fetched £ 2.7m.
mystery man banksy , whose true identity has never officially been revealed , became famous for creating politicised stencils on the walls of public buildings .
his high-profile stunts have included painting " i want out " inside the elephant enclosure of london zoo and a painting of a ladder on the partition wall in israel 's west bank .
last year , he doctored copies of paris hilton 's album to show the singer topless with a dog 's head , and placed a life-sized replica of a guantanamo bay detainee inside the disneyland theme park in california .
a gang of thieves tried to capitalise on his success last month by attempting to steal the door of a derelict building in liverpool which featured one of his paintings .
one art expert said the price showed banksy was becoming more of a household name .
" our figures show that prices for contemporary art have risen by 12 % in the last year alone , " said charles dupplin of insurance firm hiscox .
" it 's no surprise that pieces of art like this are fetching bigger sums . "
three more banksy paintings go on sale in sotheby 's on thursday in one of the biggest weeks for art auctions the uk has ever seen .
on monday , sales at sotheby 's impressionist & modern art sale in central london made almost £ 95m , a new european record .

open id aims to remove this trouble by using the personal web addresses that people maintain as a guarantee of their identity .

microsoft has got involved to supply a technology it is developing called infocards to add more flexibility to the scheme .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website so here we go again with plans to reform the house of lords .
commons leader jack straw is having another throw of the dice more than a decade after tony blair promised to do it , eight years since a " halfway house " was created and four years after voters were presented with the farcical sight of mps throwing out seven options and leaving the government with no policy at all .
this time , mr straw hopes and believes it will be different and conclusive and that the current house of lords will be replaced by something completely different and with a new name .
he has produced fresh proposals and will offer mps an unprecedented pr-style voting system in order to whittle down a new series of options - from a fully elected to a fully appointed chamber - to just a single one , with a 50/50 split his favoured option .
but no one is running away with the notion that this will be simple , or that a conclusion will be clear cut .
and the proposals have already been branded by tory theresa may a " lowest common denominator " solution which would satisfy no one and perpetuate the problem of cronyism .
her party wants 80 % of the new chamber elected , while the liberal democrats want at least that proportion elected .
stitch up one early problem will see mps required to vote to agree to mr straw 's novel voting process , which will ask them to list their options by preference .
that has already caused some anger from those in all parties who believe it is a " stitch up " aimed at stopping them throwing everything out .
and ministers have made it plain that first vote will be whipped as will all votes on the other aspects of the package , with the single exception of the composition of the upper house .
so there will now be heated debates over the proportion of peers who should be elected , how they might be elected , what powers they should keep and what salary and redundancy packages they should receive .
there will be arguments over the continuing right of bishops to sit in the upper chamber - and even suggestions there should be no second chamber at all .
mr straw 's proposals suggest a reduction in the overall number of members from 746 to 540 with 50 % elected , 30 % appointed by party leaders and 20 % by an independent commission .
members , who will no longer be called peers , will sit for a maximum of three five-year terms and elections will take place at the same time as european parliament elections , using the same regional lists system of proportional representation .
rival power but there are plenty of mps from all sides who will take issue with just about every bit of those proposals .
for example , there are demands for a far higher proportion of elected members , up to 100 % , from ministers including peter hain and hilary benn and senior tories including kenneth clarke .
they believe it would be undemocratic to continue with any appointed element , saying it would undermine the legitimacy of the chamber .
labour mp chris bryant leads a group calling for a far higher elected element , between 60 % to 100 % .
others , including liberal democrat peer lord steel and tory lord howe , argue that the house should be wholly appointed for fear it might otherwise rival the power of the elected commons .
conservative mp sir patrick cormack has laid his own proposals which would see all members except bishops and archbishops created life peers , with no elected members .
labour 's george howarth has attracted support for a commons motion demanding a unicameral system of parliament , under which there is no second chamber at all .
the senate then there will be a row over the way the elected peers are chosen .
the regional list method sees voters putting their crosses against a party , not an individual 's name , with party bosses then choosing which of their list of approved candidates is given a seat .
that system has already been branded by some as a charter for cronyism because it can leave the power of patronage firmly in the party leaders ' hands .
have your say " the un-elected lords provide a check on our headstrong lower house " chris , telford , uk send us your views it is not known how gordon brown will react to the notion of having such a thorny issue running through the early days of his expected premiership , or how the lords themselves might vote on whatever the final package is .
there are also going to be debates over exactly what the new chamber should be called , with many suggesting " the senate " , and how individuals will still become peers in recognition of good work , but will not be able to sit in it .
mr straw also sparked some dismay when he said the transition to the new arrangements will not be complete until the middle of this century , with numbers of life peers dwindling gradually as they retire , resign or die .
he also left open the question of whether the remaining 92 hereditary peers would be removed immediately and , if so , whether they should be offered any compensation .
so far , then , the emphasis seems to have been on the opposition to mr straw 's proposals .
he clearly hopes , however , that the current debate will finally move into consensus territory and that , finally , this long-running issue will be put to bed .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website big battles loom over lords reform so here we go again with plans to reform the house of lords .
commons leader jack straw is having another throw of the dice more than a decade after tony blair promised to do it , eight years since a " halfway house " was created and four years after voters were presented with the farcical sight of mps throwing out seven options and leaving the government with no policy at all .
this time , mr straw hopes and believes it will be different and conclusive and that the current house of lords will be replaced by something completely different and with a new name .
he has produced fresh proposals and will offer mps an unprecedented pr-style voting system in order to whittle down a new series of options - from a fully elected to a fully appointed chamber - to just a single one , with a 50/50 split his favoured option .
but no one is running away with the notion that this will be simple , or that a conclusion will be clear cut .
and the proposals have already been branded by tory theresa may a " lowest common denominator " solution which would satisfy no one and perpetuate the problem of cronyism .
her party wants 80 % of the new chamber elected , while the liberal democrats want at least that proportion elected .
stitch up one early problem will see mps required to vote to agree to mr straw 's novel voting process , which will ask them to list their options by preference .
that has already caused some anger from those in all parties who believe it is a " stitch up " aimed at stopping them throwing everything out .
mr straw has sought to ensure a conclusion to debate and ministers have made it plain that first vote will be whipped as will all votes on the other aspects of the package , with the single exception of the composition of the upper house .
so there will now be heated debates over the proportion of peers who should be elected , how they might be elected , what powers they should keep and what salary and redundancy packages they should receive .
there will be arguments over the continuing right of bishops to sit in the upper chamber - and even suggestions there should be no second chamber at all .
mr straw 's proposals suggest a reduction in the overall number of members from 746 to 540 with 50 % elected , 30 % appointed by party leaders and 20 % by an independent commission .
members , who will no longer be called peers , will sit for a maximum of three five-year terms and elections will take place at the same time as european parliament elections , using the same regional lists system of proportional representation .

commons leader jack straw is having another throw of the dice more than a decade after tony blair promised to do it , eight years since a " halfway house " was created and four years after voters were presented with the farcical sight of mps throwing out seven options and leaving the government with no policy at all .
this time , mr straw hopes and believes it will be different and conclusive and that the current house of lords will be replaced by something completely different and with a new name .
he has produced fresh proposals and will offer mps an unprecedented pr-style voting system in order to whittle down a new series of options - from a fully elected to a fully appointed chamber - to just a single one , with a 50/50 split his favoured option .
but no one is running away with the notion that this will be simple , or that a conclusion will be clear cut .
and the proposals have already been branded by tory theresa may a " lowest common denominator " solution which would satisfy no one and perpetuate the problem of cronyism .
her party wants 80 % of the new chamber elected , while the liberal democrats want at least that proportion elected .
stitch up one early problem will see mps required to vote to agree to mr straw 's novel voting process , which will ask them to list their options by preference .
that has already caused some anger from those in all parties who believe it is a " stitch up " aimed at stopping them throwing everything out .
mr straw has sought to ensure a conclusion to debate and ministers have made it plain that first vote will be whipped as will all votes on the other aspects of the package , with the single exception of the composition of the upper house .
so there will now be heated debates over the proportion of peers who should be elected , how they might be elected , what powers they should keep and what salary and redundancy packages they should receive .
there will be arguments over the continuing right of bishops to sit in the upper chamber - and even suggestions there should be no second chamber at all .
mr straw 's proposals suggest a reduction in the overall number of members from 746 to 540 with 50 % elected , 30 % appointed by party leaders and 20 % by an independent commission .
members , who will no longer be called peers , will sit for a maximum of three five-year terms and elections will take place at the same time as european parliament elections , using the same regional lists system of proportional representation .
rival power but there are plenty of mps from all sides who will take issue with just about every bit of those proposals .
for example , there are demands for a far higher proportion of elected members , up to 100 % , from ministers including peter hain and hilary benn and senior tories including kenneth clarke .
mr bryant leading calls for a larger elected membership they believe it would be undemocratic to continue with any appointed element , saying it would undermine the legitimacy of the chamber .
labour mp chris bryant leads a group calling for a far higher elected element , between 60 % to 100 % .
others , including liberal democrat peer lord steel and tory lord howe , argue that the house should be wholly appointed for fear it might otherwise rival the power of the elected commons .
conservative mp sir patrick cormack has laid his own proposals which would see all members except bishops and archbishops created life peers , with no elected members .
labour 's george howarth has attracted support for a commons motion demanding a unicameral system of parliament , under which there is no second chamber at all .
the senate then there will be a row over the way the elected peers are chosen .
the regional list method sees voters putting their crosses against a party , not an individual 's name , with party bosses then choosing which of their list of approved candidates is given a seat .
that system has already been branded by some as a charter for cronyism because it can leave the power of patronage firmly in the party leaders ' hands .
have your say the un-elected lords provide a check on our headstrong lower house chris , telford , uk send us your views it is not known how gordon brown will react to the notion of having such a thorny issue running through the early days of his expected premiership , or how the lords themselves might vote on whatever the final package is .
there are also going to be debates over exactly what the new chamber should be called , with many suggesting " the senate " , and how individuals will still become peers in recognition of good work , but will not be able to sit in it .
mr straw also sparked some dismay when he said the transition to the new arrangements will not be complete until the middle of this century , with numbers of life peers dwindling gradually as they retire , resign or die .
he also left open the question of whether the remaining 92 hereditary peers would be removed immediately and , if so , whether they should be offered any compensation .
so far , then , the emphasis seems to have been on the opposition to mr straw 's proposals .
he clearly hopes , however , that the current debate will finally move into consensus territory and that , finally , this long-running issue will be put to bed .

a total of 5,992 abortions were carried out at marie stopes international 's nine uk clinics in january - a rise of 13 % on the 5,304 in january 2005 .
this is more in a month than at any time in the charity 's 32-year history .
but pregnancy advice groups said the figures probably reflected poor access to contraceptive services .
partying excess and alcohol consumption combine to increase libido and lower inhibition liz davies of marie stopes international marie stopes said there was a " clear case " for the government to launch a campaign on the run up to the festive season to alert women and men to the importance of preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually-transmitted infections .
last christmas the charity offered festive " party purses " stocked with condoms and the morning after pill .
liz davies , msi director of uk operations , said : " despite our efforts we have still seen the biggest rise ever in abortion figures in the month after christmas .
" we may be seeing the consequences of the festive season , when partying excess and alcohol consumption combine to increase libido and lower inhibition , with the inevitable consequences of unprotected sex resulting in unplanned pregnancies . "
the british pregnancy advisory service -lrb- bpas -rrb- , also saw a higher than usual number of women for abortion treatment this january .
clinics closing but it blames poor service provision for the increase .
chief executive ann furedi said : " closure of family planning facilities , gps and pharmacists during the holiday period means contraceptive access is reduced .
" women who needed an abortion referral in december may also have had to wait until the holidays are over in january to get treatment .
" this year , to make things much worse , drastic nhs spending cutbacks are resulting in well-documented delays to abortion in some areas .
" it may be due to that treatment bottleneck that the treatments have been clustered together in january . "
a spokesman for the department of health said that improving access to emergency contraception was " only one part of a complex picture " to reducing abortion rates .
he said : " our policy has always been that safe sex , using reliable contraception on a regular basis , is the best way for women to protect against unintended pregnancy .
" we are working hard to reduce the demand for abortions and have undertaken an audit to identify gaps in service provision . "
the society for the protection of unborn children said easier access to birth control drugs and devices was not the solution , and said such measures had failed to contain the rising number of abortions .
according to department of health statistics , a total of 186,400 abortions were carried out in england and wales in 2005 .
a total of 84 % of these were funded by the nhs and over half of these were performed under contract in the independent sector by clinics such as those run by marie stopes and bpas .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- should i fight back : transcript home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics version -pipe- accessibility help help bbc news more programmes file on 4 newsnight this world more ...
last updated : thursday , 8 february 2007 , 11:10 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version should i fight back : transcript nb : this transcript was typed from a transcription unit recording and not copied from an original script : because of the possibility of mis-hearing and the difficulty , in some cases of identifying individual speakers , the bbc cannot vouch for its accuracy .
panorama should i fight back ?
recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 5:02:07 jeremy vine : good evening .
i 'm jeremy vine and this is panorama .
two robbers with knives attack an elderly newsagent .
he instinctively fights back .
is he a hero or just plain foolish ?
put yourself in this man 's shoes , he went to the aid of two teenagers being attacked by a gang .
do you join in or walk on by ?
you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman .
what do you do ?
do you retreat and ring the police ?
it 's a split second decision that any of us could face at any time , whether to intervene or turn away .
it 's happened to me , maybe it 's happened to you .
tonight we 're asking if we do n't take action when we see crime and antisocial behaviour happening right in front of our eyes , who will ?
i 've been meeting people who have fought back against criminals with vastly different consequences , but as individuals just what is the right thing to do when we are confronted by violence or antisocial behaviour ?
stoke on trent here an armed robber runs into a busy post office .
robber : oi , put the money in the bag .
put the money in the bag or you get it through the head .
now .
quick !
vine : kym ledgar , the sub-postmistress was terrified .
kym ledgar : i saw this figure all in black , and could n't even see like the whites of his eyes , and he 'd got the shotgun , he 'd pointed it at me and then he moved it to customer and he said , in a very threatening strong voice : robber : put the money in the bag .
manager : give him the money kim .
robber : put the money in the f * * * ing bag .
quick !
kim : so i just got up and did exactly as he said .
vine : her husband , barry , a former soldier , walked straight into the middle of the robbery .
barry : it was an instant decision .
well we came into contact right by the counter here .
he started to turn , i grabbed hold of the barrel of the shotgun and as he turned , with the my other hand i grabbed his collar .
vine : barry , in beige , grabbed the robber who 's wearing a hood .
kim : i remember giving out a blood-curdling scream because i thought i could well lose him .
barry : he was pulling away , i was pushing .
it was a struggle for the gun , control of the gun .
kim : i knew barry would n't let go .
i just knew how determined he would be .
i was just in fear of his life .
barry : and we bounced off one or two of the walls and then he threatened to kill me , all part and parcel of it .
then he let go of the gun and leapt up and he was out through the door .
vine : barry , who has a serious heart condition , cracked a rib in the vicious struggle .
kim : i thought i might have lost him actually .
he 'd gone an ashen colour and his lips had gone purple , and i was very , very concerned that he was going to have a heart attack .
vine : the robber was sasha markovic , a heroin addict and persistent offender .
barry was awarded a bravery medal by the police but confusingly they tell others not to follow his example .
chief inspector paul clews staffordshire police we generally advise in such a serious incident like that people should n't get involved , but i 'd certainly not be critical of barry for his bravery .
vine : for barry it 's not really about bravery , he feels he simply ca n't look on while the family post office is targeted by robbers .
four times its happened in 15 years .
so next time ?
barry : if i was confronted by a criminal in similar circumstances i would hope i would do the same .
it depends on the situation .
it 's not something you can give a general advice to .
if you can avoid it , then by all means if you think it 's dangerous , do n't do it .
phone the police and let the police handle it , they 're trained for it .
vine : just 34 % of us would stop teenagers vandalising a bus shelter compared to 65 % of germans and 52 % of spaniards .
armed with some disturbing cctv footage i decided to do my own research with the public .
-lsb- vox pops on the street -rsb- man : i 'd have thought if he 's got a weapon , get out .
vine : yeah ?
man : mmm .
man 2 : if ever i saw that , probably i do n't fight back , no , i 'd run .
vine : the knife ?
man 2 : a knife .
i might fight back .
woman : i do n't know if i 'd physically walk over to them .
i mean i might scream out and say : " what are you doing ? "
i definitely would phone the police .
sunderland vine : but you ca n't always be sure the police will get there in time , and if you 're on an estate like this one and there are gangs involved and it 's just you , the stakes can be very high .
in the end , for lots of people , stepping forward is a snap judgement , it 's instantaneous and , for some , it 's disastrous .
-lsb- home video -rsb- tom : this is the first of january 1902 .
child : 2004 !
tom : 2004 , alright , i stand corrected .
vine : a happy family scene , but tom noble 's children don ? t have a father anymore .
he was a builder and a fit man , and a year after this was filmed he thought he could help a young girl who was being attacked by teenagers in his street .
geoff bird tom 's friend tom walked straight in amongst all of them and asked what was going on and one lad said : " and what are you going to do about it ? " sort of thing , he was the tallest lad of the group .
and i mean tom was ex-army and he was n't sort of phased by anybody , certainly nobody like that , and he squared up to the lad and said ... you know : " i ? m out here to sort it out " and the lad turned and ran away .
tom turned to face myself and as he walked back towards me , the lad ran up behind him and punched him in the back of the neck .
i saw the look in his eye , he was looking directly at me when the blow hit him in the neck and he died before he hit the ground .
so ... that 's it .
vine : as paramedics fought to save him , pauline , tom 's partner of 12 years , watched .
but the punch had severed an artery in his neck .
pauline cowan they gave like an injection and then i saw the machine go ... the machine went ' beep ' like that and then it went flat then , and that 's when i sort of got quite a shock .
i sort of went : " oh no " and they said " no " and kept on working on him .
vine : fifty-two year old tom was rushed to hospital .
two days later they switched off his life support .
geoff : tom was my best friend .
there was nobody else could come close to that .
it was just a terrible loss .
vine : the killer was 16 , a schoolboy , gary prescott .
he was already on an asbo for criminal damage and drunkenness .
in fact it 's thought the police had stopped him one hour before the attack , but they did n't take him in .
now they 've charged him with manslaughter and pauline was determined to face him in court .
pauline : and i just had to stare at him and stare at him because i just felt ... you know , i want you to look at me and see what ... you 've robbed me of my life .
you took tom 's life but you 've also took my life away .
vine : and here there is a cruel lesson for good samaritans .
tom 's attacker got three years in prison .
no , make that 18 months after an early release .
geoff : it was typical of tom , it was typical of any of us , myself , my wife , we would have all done the same thing .
it just happened that tom was the first one there .
but yeah , he would have helped anybody .
vine : what about the killer ?
his family did n't want to be shown , but we spoke to them .
prescott 's father says he 's sorry tom died but it 's his own fault because he chose to have a go .
prescott snr : a grown man , he were n't a teenager .
what 's he going to be thinking ?
it 's either you 're gonna get hit or he 's gonna get it , but there was no malice in it .
vine : no malice !
prescott ? s grandmother , sylvia hope , is sorry but says she would have done the same as her grandson .
sylvia hope : if anybody was coming at me i would have done the same .
i 'm sorry , but anybody who was coming at me , and i thought somebody was going to throw a punch at me , well i would go forward first .
vine : tom was killed for trying to do the right thing , so pauline has been thinking it through .
was it right when the cost of taking action was so high ?
it 's now nearly two years since tom died and she 's come to maybe a surprising conclusion .
pauline : i 'm pleased tom did what he did .
obviously the consequences were awful , but i still think that i would do it myself if i saw someone getting hurt i would go out and do something , and i think people should , you know , i mean i don ? t want people to go out and obviously lose their lives and things like that , but if some innocent person is getting hurt people 's got to help them .
-lsb- street vox pops -rsb- vine : what do you do ?
man : it 's a tough decision , is n't it ?
it depends on how many people are about , whether you 're ... yeah , if you can handle yourself and you think you can take control of the situation , yeah , i think you do .
woman : i usually do intervene .
vine : what do you do ?
woman : well i usually say : " i think you 're being silly " you know " why don ? t you just go home ? " or something like that .
man 2 : i have done in the past and it ended up with ...
i don ? t know if you can see it .
vine : let 's have a look .
oh yeah , you 've got a scar there .
man 2 : yeah , i 've got a scar , i 've got another one here where i intervened in a pub .
a friend of mine , he lost his leg through it .
vine : and what happened there , a pub fight was it ?
man 2 : we were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
vine : the government 's big idea is for us all to be doing something before the trouble starts where we live .
that 's their ' respect ' agenda .
' give respect , get respect ' is the slogan .
it 's all about tackling antisocial behaviour before it 's taken root .
now picture that .
in fact you do n't have to picture it , we can show you it .
birmingham -lsb- video footage -rsb- linda and michelle , mary and sheila , they probably would n't want to be called the b team but they are in birmingham .
there 's strength in numbers and the women had all joined together to fight back against antisocial behaviour without having to risk going it alone .
linda : can you go over there now because there 's been some problem with fly-tipping over there .
wagons roll .
have you got your torches guys ?
there 's a television been dumped .
we 'll get it moved tomorrow .
mary : why oh why do people do it ?
people keep dumping things .
linda : i know .
let 's start leafleting guys , now .
vine : a few years ago being out after dark on the perry common estate would not be recommended .
thugs ruled .
decent residents lived in terror .
mary : i was more angry than frightened .
there was n't a night went by when we did n't have one of our windows put through .
but rather scary been sitting in your armchair and having glass all of a sudden come over you .
i was very , very angry .
michelle ashmore perry common community watch it became a no go zone and there was rat runs and we were having speeding cars and smashing them up on the ... like straight into the trees , and then you 'd got a car ... a wrecked car on the public open spaces and things , so i think the fear of crime rose quite a lot and people would n't walk the streets after sort of 6 o 'clock at night .
vine : and what these women had done by getting involved is right up the government 's street .
last year mr blair launched his respect agenda with a splash , it 's to empower us ordinary citizens to tackle antisocial behaviour ourselves and not just leave it to the police and other authorities .
tony blair : what 's important obviously is to give the local communities the powers that they need to crack down on antisocial behaviour .
vine : it 's easy to laugh at a neighbourhood watch scheme on wheels but here burglaries have dropped by 42 % in three years and car crime by nearly 30 % .
and our active citizens are toasted .
they go to conferences .
on stage here in bristol the government 's so-called respect tzar louise casey tells them what they already know .
lousie casey : the public are the most important ... the most important , the most crucial , and indeed , if i dare say it , the sometimes forgotten weapon in the battle against antisocial behaviour .
vine : as night falls , off they go again .
this is not once a month , or weekends only , it 's a way of life .
linda : what you doing ?
you 're doing ... just walking about ?
kids : yeah .
linda : have you been to youth club ?
boy : yeah .
linda : have you ?
boy : yeah .
linda : do you like it there or not ?
boy : it 's alright .
boy 2 : it 's good .
linda : is it ?
oh grand .
boy : we have responsibilities and everything in the club and we 're looking after other people .
linda : you 're looking after the streets , are you ?
boys : yeah .
linda : ... and checking in ... checking to see if people are having problems ?
sheila barker perry common community watch we do n't challenge .
we 're not have-a-go heroes , we 're just normal people that care about our community .
vine : and the government wants more of us to be as involved as those birmingham women .
in fact a leaked home office initiative centred on the slogan : " don ? t moan , take action , it 's your street too . "
but that caused confusion among people who say : " well how far are we expected to go when we see violent or antisocial behaviour ? "
you see something happening in the street , do you step in ?
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security the general line must be to get in touch with the authorities straightaway and make sure that , if things are as bad as you paint , that the police will be there as quickly as they can .
vine : you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman , what do you do ?
you retreat and ring the police ?
mcnulty : i think you should in the first instance , it may well be that simply shouting at them , blowing your horn or whatever else deters them and they go away .
vine : he 's now hitting her and the police have n't come .
what do you do then ?
mcnulty : the same ... the same .
vine : you still wait ?
mcnulty : you must get back to the police , try some distractive activities , whatever else .
vine : what , jump up and down ?
mcnulty : but i would say ... well sometimes that may well work .
vine : i 'm confused here because we 're told that your line on this is that people should stop moaning and tackle antisocial behaviour themselves : " it 's your street too . "
mcnulty : but " do n't moan , take action " is about wider communities fully embracing the respect agenda , fully embracing all the elements at their disposal through antisocial behaviour legislation and taking action through those official , formal channels .
vine : well listening to that you have to hope that if you 're ever attacked in the street it 's not the home office minister who happens to be passing , and the whole idea of ringing the police is problematic when the police seem to be overrun in so many areas .
so take carlisle for example , there the housing association has had to enlist what is effectively a private army to help the tenants and deal with the yobs , and i went to see them in action .
young criminals setting fire to front doors right beside some houses .
imagine living next to this , but you certainly would not want to tackle this lot on your own .
what the teenagers didn ? t know was that ex-sas men were filming their activities .
-lsb- filming : night time , hooded youths feeding blaze -rsb- steve harrison carlisle housing association it 's difficult to get evidence when we 're investigating antisocial behaviour where the residents and the victims are feeling intimidated and they do n't want to come forward for fear of repercussions and we thought if we can send them out and go out and gather the evidence from the streets , that would be enough for us to be able to take to court and prove to the court that the nuisance is actually taking place .
tim the surveillance group we have kind of a lot of different types of covert cameras like vision lenses , long-range lenses , not your average hand-held video cameras .
vine : tim 's surveillance group is employed by councils all over the uk , and sometimes even by the police who have n't got time to stake out estates like his ex-soldiers .
tim : a lot of them say they 're just as likely to get injured on the streets of a kind of major uk conurbation as they were in afghanistan or iraq .
the difference is this time it 's a 14 year old or a group of 14 year olds who may or may not happen to be carrying a knife .
steve : it does seem a bit extreme but you have to put yourself in the position of the victims who are suffering day in and day out nuisance , antisocial behaviour , intimidation , threats , noise nuisance , that type of thing , and to live with that every day ... and it can bring an estate down .
vine : and they know if they watch the right people , eventually they will do the wrong thing .
-lsb- filming : youths break into parked vehicle and driving it away -rsb- vine : who are these guys ?
tim : this is a group of youths who have recently turned up in a stolen vehicle .
these two were the ones which have just driven it onto ... into the centre of the park with the lights off .
vine : and there 's something going on here , there 's three young lads and there 's two or three girls , i do n't know what they 're doing actually , i 'm just trying to see .
tim : i think they 're just moving up to enjoy the spectacle .
vine : oh there 's the car , and the group of youths who we 've seen walking along the bank have just walked down to the car , probably opened the petrol cap and just torched it .
they have , however , stripped it of its alloy wheels and very shortly we see them walking back with all of those alloys .
you 'd think they might disperse or run away , frightened of being arrested , but it 's not happening , is it .
tim : it shows how brazen they are .
it shows how brazen they are .
the lack of respect for the police , the lack of respect for the general public seems to be reaching epidemic proportions , and it is very frightening to observe .
vine : i must say it does feel rather strange going out in a 4x4 with a camera and a former special forces man looking for kids who might get out of control .
it 's all about watching .
the metal pole is hard to miss .
but the ex-soldiers wont put themselves in personal danger .
tim : see the activity with girl on there , lighting and striking the light out , heating up the little block of dope .
vine : this is not a scenario in which you 'd want to intervene alone .
tim : not the kind of behaviour you want .
you see if you live in that house there you do n't want kids running all over your wall ...
vine : we 're just listening to the radio here because ...
-lsb- radio -rsb- ... they 're coming in this direction and back the way they came .
vine : we 're just being told there are three guys coming towards us who 've just been fighting , come from down near the bowling alley and we do n't want them to see us in the car so ...
sometimes it 's verbal abuse , sometimes it 's worse , and even though the men filming used to be in special forces , they do n't try to break anything up .
tim : i would advise extreme caution .
invariably we see people coming out and wanting to get involved but they 're putting themselves at quite a great deal of risk .
you know , if we ? re concerned about getting involved they most certainly should be .
they 're just an average joe from the street and they really do have to be very , very careful .
vine : so one thing is clear here , cracking down on thuggery is not only the job of the police , but once we decide it 's our job too , that can have unforeseen consequences .
one man in kent thought he 'd teach a group of local teenagers a lesson they would n't forget and he found himself on the wrong side of the law .
looking at paul , kim and their daughter megan , you would n't guess what they ? ve been through .
paul 's experience proves a cautionary tale if you 're thinking of being a good samaritan .
they used to live above a corner shop where they were constantly being sworn at and threatened by a group of teenage lads with nobody to turn to for help .
kimberley tucker : i was frightened , i was frightened for megan .
i 've been losing sleep .
obviously went to the doctors .
i just could n't eat .
i was just worrying all the time what 's going to happen , what are they going to do next as they threatened to burn down the house with me and megan inside ...
vine : the couple rang the police again and again and specifically said that the shopkeeper , mr patel , had been racially abused , but the trouble carried on .
the youths even taunted paul 's mum and finally he decided he could ignore it no longer .
but on that night you took action .
paul catlow yes .
well the police had done nothing .
they 'd been called at least twice before .
we 'd been to the school about their behaviour .
so i thought enough was enough and i wanted to make a citizen 's arrest .
vine : you pursued them .
paul : i pursued them just up this road here and had all kinds of abuse thrown back at me .
vine : paul and the shopkeeper jumped into their van and found one of the lads hiding in bushes .
paul : i sort of pulled him out and said : " come on " and he struggled with me and then just basically fell to the floor on my feet .
i pulled him up and said : " look , i ? m not going to hurt you , i just want to ... you know , put an end to all this . "
he said : " okay , do n't call the police , i 'll come and apologise to your parents and everyone involved " and that was that .
so we got in the van ...
vine : so he got into the van of his own free will .
paul : yeah , he got in the van .
vine : he volunteered to get in .
paul : yeah , he volunteered to get in the van .
went down to my mum 's , he apologised to her .
carolyn catlow paul ? s mother he said he was sorry .
mr patel said : " now say you 're sorry as though you mean it " i think he meant , so he said : " i ? m really sorry " and he looked really embarrassed .
but paul then said : " well i ? m glad you 've done that .
that ? s it now , let ? s forget it all . "
vine : but he could n't forget it .
the next day when paul was back at his job in the city , the teenager was telling the police he had been kidnapped .
we ca n't name the youths but they were known troublemakers .
paul 's life froze .
he was arrested and charged with kidnap and assault , he even went to prison .
paul : it 's just really a horrible experience really .
you know , i did n't get a lot of sleep at all .
the food was awful , you know , i lost a lot of weight .
and the thing is that was so frustrating , everyone in there said ... you know , they heard my story and they all say ... you know : " we all say we should n't be in here but you really should n't be here . "
and even the gaolers actually told me that as well , you know : " what ?
this is a joke !
what are you doing here ?
it 's appalling . "
vine : paul was bailed after a week , but the louts were waiting with more and more abuse which kim recorded in pages of notes .
the couple rang the police more than 40 times with no result .
after 14 months paul arrived in court .
one of the kids did n't even bother to turn up and the case collapsed .
carolyn : i think the youths have won because they 've got away with it .
they 've just not been punished and they 're out there to do it again and they probably will .
-lsb- vox pops on street -rsb- young woman : but that 's today 's society , is n't it ?
you ca n't do right for doing wrong really , or you ca n't do ... you know , so ...
vine : yeah , so you 're worried you get involved you might get on the wrong end of the law .
girl : yeah , i mean ... well it 's just ... and there 's so many loopholes to everything , you know .
what can and ca n't you do as ... you know , a citizen of society , you know , you just do n't know really .
vine : do you fear that in a situation where you got involved and you went in physically to stop something , do you worry the police might turn up and arrest you ?
man : yes , definitely .
vine : why do you worry about that ?
man : because that 's what happens , is n't it ?
if you 're under 16 and your first claim is to say : " i was hit , i was doing nothing , he 's an adult .. "
rah di rah di rah ... and you read about it all the time .
vine : we asked to interview the police officers involved in paul catlow 's case , but they said no .
the met told us they did n't comment on criminal justice matters .
when you hear that story , minister , you must think : " why do bother ? "
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security well not quite , i do feel that sometimes when i read newspapers , but whatever the provocation , however much someone has irritated or annoyed , i have to take it back in some circumstances , again through frustration or whatever else , and violently seeking to get redress ...
vine : he did n't use violence ... he came in his van to apologise .
i mean this poor guy , he 's had 18 months knocked out of his life .
mcnulty : ah but if you turn round ...
i do n't want to dwell on the specific case , but most people with commonsense would say that that needs at least a cursory investigation .
now i know in this particular case it was longer , but people would i think be ... look awry at the police if they did n't at least look into the circumstances and context of that .
vine : but come on , it 's just commonsense , this is .
you know , the idea the police turn up and have to investigate the law-abiding citizen who took action it 's just pc plod is n't it ?
surely they can see the situation .
mcnulty : more often than not in these cases commonsense has prevailed once the context has been fully understood .
vine : it just seems to be easier for the police to arrest the law-abiding citizen and get him into court because they know he 'll turn up .
mcnulty : i understand that , i understand people 's frustration too .
but things must be done through the appropriate channels .
paul : actually no , because they 're under 18 they 're untouchable and the police have admitted that to me as well .
one police community officer actually said the boy involved needed a good kicking , and i actually turned round and said to her : " this is a new safer neighbourhood scheme ... is this what you call a safer neighbourhood , encouraging people to go out and kick them in ? "
i said : " i have n't even done that and look how i 've ended up .
so could you imagine if i did do that and take your advice , what would happen ? "
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : do you regret being a good samaritan ?
paul : no , i think if everyone sort of ... you know , sat back and let these kids get on with it because of the way the law stands , i think we 'd be heading for quite a disaster .
i think it needs people to stand up to these yobs and go out there and take action .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- pauline cowan tom noble 's partner if we ignore things and just let them get away with it , we are turning to be as bad as what they are and it 's not a society that you want to live in .
you want it to be a better society so you 've got to go out and help each other because if you do n't these yobs are definitely going to win , they 're going to take over .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : well that 's all for this week , but don ? t forget you can join the argument on my radio 2 show at midday each day and also please do email us here at panorama if there ? s anything you want us to investigate .

panorama should i fight back ?
recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 5:02:07 jeremy vine : good evening .
i 'm jeremy vine and this is panorama .
two robbers with knives attack an elderly newsagent .
he instinctively fights back .
is he a hero or just plain foolish ?
put yourself in this man 's shoes , he went to the aid of two teenagers being attacked by a gang .
do you join in or walk on by ?
you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman .
what do you do ?
do you retreat and ring the police ?
it 's a split second decision that any of us could face at any time , whether to intervene or turn away .
it 's happened to me , maybe it 's happened to you .
tonight we 're asking if we do n't take action when we see crime and antisocial behaviour happening right in front of our eyes , who will ?
i 've been meeting people who have fought back against criminals with vastly different consequences , but as individuals just what is the right thing to do when we are confronted by violence or antisocial behaviour ?
stoke on trent here an armed robber runs into a busy post office .
robber : oi , put the money in the bag .
put the money in the bag or you get it through the head .
now .
quick !
vine : kym ledgar , the sub-postmistress was terrified .
kym ledgar : i saw this figure all in black , and could n't even see like the whites of his eyes , and he 'd got the shotgun , he 'd pointed it at me and then he moved it to customer and he said , in a very threatening strong voice : robber : put the money in the bag .
manager : give him the money kim .
robber : put the money in the f * * * ing bag .
quick !
kim : so i just got up and did exactly as he said .
vine : her husband , barry , a former soldier , walked straight into the middle of the robbery .
barry : it was an instant decision .
well we came into contact right by the counter here .
he started to turn , i grabbed hold of the barrel of the shotgun and as he turned , with the my other hand i grabbed his collar .
vine : barry , in beige , grabbed the robber who 's wearing a hood .
kim : i remember giving out a blood-curdling scream because i thought i could well lose him .
barry : he was pulling away , i was pushing .
it was a struggle for the gun , control of the gun .
kim : i knew barry would n't let go .
i just knew how determined he would be .
i was just in fear of his life .
barry : and we bounced off one or two of the walls and then he threatened to kill me , all part and parcel of it .
then he let go of the gun and leapt up and he was out through the door .
vine : barry , who has a serious heart condition , cracked a rib in the vicious struggle .
kim : i thought i might have lost him actually .
he 'd gone an ashen colour and his lips had gone purple , and i was very , very concerned that he was going to have a heart attack .
vine : the robber was sasha markovic , a heroin addict and persistent offender .
barry was awarded a bravery medal by the police but confusingly they tell others not to follow his example .
chief inspector paul clews staffordshire police we generally advise in such a serious incident like that people should n't get involved , but i 'd certainly not be critical of barry for his bravery .
vine : for barry it 's not really about bravery , he feels he simply ca n't look on while the family post office is targeted by robbers .
four times its happened in 15 years .
so next time ?
barry : if i was confronted by a criminal in similar circumstances i would hope i would do the same .
it depends on the situation .
it 's not something you can give a general advice to .
if you can avoid it , then by all means if you think it 's dangerous , do n't do it .
phone the police and let the police handle it , they 're trained for it .
vine : just 34 % of us would stop teenagers vandalising a bus shelter compared to 65 % of germans and 52 % of spaniards .
armed with some disturbing cctv footage i decided to do my own research with the public .
-lsb- vox pops on the street -rsb- man : i 'd have thought if he 's got a weapon , get out .
vine : yeah ?
man : mmm .
man 2 : if ever i saw that , probably i do n't fight back , no , i 'd run .
vine : the knife ?
man 2 : a knife .
i might fight back .
woman : i do n't know if i 'd physically walk over to them .
i mean i might scream out and say : " what are you doing ? "
i definitely would phone the police .
sunderland vine : but you ca n't always be sure the police will get there in time , and if you 're on an estate like this one and there are gangs involved and it 's just you , the stakes can be very high .
in the end , for lots of people , stepping forward is a snap judgement , it 's instantaneous and , for some , it 's disastrous .
-lsb- home video -rsb- tom : this is the first of january 1902 .
child : 2004 !
tom : 2004 , alright , i stand corrected .
vine : a happy family scene , but tom noble 's children don ? t have a father anymore .
he was a builder and a fit man , and a year after this was filmed he thought he could help a young girl who was being attacked by teenagers in his street .
geoff bird tom 's friend tom walked straight in amongst all of them and asked what was going on and one lad said : " and what are you going to do about it ? " sort of thing , he was the tallest lad of the group .
and i mean tom was ex-army and he was n't sort of phased by anybody , certainly nobody like that , and he squared up to the lad and said ... you know : " i ? m out here to sort it out " and the lad turned and ran away .
tom turned to face myself and as he walked back towards me , the lad ran up behind him and punched him in the back of the neck .
i saw the look in his eye , he was looking directly at me when the blow hit him in the neck and he died before he hit the ground .
so ... that 's it .
vine : as paramedics fought to save him , pauline , tom 's partner of 12 years , watched .
but the punch had severed an artery in his neck .
pauline cowan they gave like an injection and then i saw the machine go ... the machine went ' beep ' like that and then it went flat then , and that 's when i sort of got quite a shock .
i sort of went : " oh no " and they said " no " and kept on working on him .
vine : fifty-two year old tom was rushed to hospital .
two days later they switched off his life support .
geoff : tom was my best friend .
there was nobody else could come close to that .
it was just a terrible loss .
vine : the killer was 16 , a schoolboy , gary prescott .
he was already on an asbo for criminal damage and drunkenness .
in fact it 's thought the police had stopped him one hour before the attack , but they did n't take him in .
now they 've charged him with manslaughter and pauline was determined to face him in court .
pauline : and i just had to stare at him and stare at him because i just felt ... you know , i want you to look at me and see what ... you 've robbed me of my life .
you took tom 's life but you 've also took my life away .
vine : and here there is a cruel lesson for good samaritans .
tom 's attacker got three years in prison .
no , make that 18 months after an early release .
geoff : it was typical of tom , it was typical of any of us , myself , my wife , we would have all done the same thing .
it just happened that tom was the first one there .
but yeah , he would have helped anybody .
vine : what about the killer ?
his family did n't want to be shown , but we spoke to them .
prescott 's father says he 's sorry tom died but it 's his own fault because he chose to have a go .
prescott snr : a grown man , he were n't a teenager .
what 's he going to be thinking ?
it 's either you 're gonna get hit or he 's gonna get it , but there was no malice in it .
vine : no malice !
prescott ? s grandmother , sylvia hope , is sorry but says she would have done the same as her grandson .
sylvia hope : if anybody was coming at me i would have done the same .
i 'm sorry , but anybody who was coming at me , and i thought somebody was going to throw a punch at me , well i would go forward first .
vine : tom was killed for trying to do the right thing , so pauline has been thinking it through .
was it right when the cost of taking action was so high ?
it 's now nearly two years since tom died and she 's come to maybe a surprising conclusion .
pauline : i 'm pleased tom did what he did .
obviously the consequences were awful , but i still think that i would do it myself if i saw someone getting hurt i would go out and do something , and i think people should , you know , i mean i don ? t want people to go out and obviously lose their lives and things like that , but if some innocent person is getting hurt people 's got to help them .
-lsb- street vox pops -rsb- vine : what do you do ?
man : it 's a tough decision , is n't it ?
it depends on how many people are about , whether you 're ... yeah , if you can handle yourself and you think you can take control of the situation , yeah , i think you do .
woman : i usually do intervene .
vine : what do you do ?
woman : well i usually say : " i think you 're being silly " you know " why don ? t you just go home ? " or something like that .
man 2 : i have done in the past and it ended up with ...
i don ? t know if you can see it .
vine : let 's have a look .
oh yeah , you 've got a scar there .
man 2 : yeah , i 've got a scar , i 've got another one here where i intervened in a pub .
a friend of mine , he lost his leg through it .
vine : and what happened there , a pub fight was it ?
man 2 : we were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
vine : the government 's big idea is for us all to be doing something before the trouble starts where we live .
that 's their ' respect ' agenda .
' give respect , get respect ' is the slogan .
it 's all about tackling antisocial behaviour before it 's taken root .
now picture that .
in fact you do n't have to picture it , we can show you it .
birmingham -lsb- video footage -rsb- linda and michelle , mary and sheila , they probably would n't want to be called the b team but they are in birmingham .
there 's strength in numbers and the women had all joined together to fight back against antisocial behaviour without having to risk going it alone .
linda : can you go over there now because there 's been some problem with fly-tipping over there .
wagons roll .
have you got your torches guys ?
there 's a television been dumped .
we 'll get it moved tomorrow .
mary : why oh why do people do it ?
people keep dumping things .
linda : i know .
let 's start leafleting guys , now .
vine : a few years ago being out after dark on the perry common estate would not be recommended .
thugs ruled .
decent residents lived in terror .
mary : i was more angry than frightened .
there was n't a night went by when we did n't have one of our windows put through .
but rather scary been sitting in your armchair and having glass all of a sudden come over you .
i was very , very angry .
michelle ashmore perry common community watch it became a no go zone and there was rat runs and we were having speeding cars and smashing them up on the ... like straight into the trees , and then you 'd got a car ... a wrecked car on the public open spaces and things , so i think the fear of crime rose quite a lot and people would n't walk the streets after sort of 6 o 'clock at night .
vine : and what these women had done by getting involved is right up the government 's street .
last year mr blair launched his respect agenda with a splash , it 's to empower us ordinary citizens to tackle antisocial behaviour ourselves and not just leave it to the police and other authorities .
tony blair : what 's important obviously is to give the local communities the powers that they need to crack down on antisocial behaviour .
vine : it 's easy to laugh at a neighbourhood watch scheme on wheels but here burglaries have dropped by 42 % in three years and car crime by nearly 30 % .
and our active citizens are toasted .
they go to conferences .
on stage here in bristol the government 's so-called respect tzar louise casey tells them what they already know .
lousie casey : the public are the most important ... the most important , the most crucial , and indeed , if i dare say it , the sometimes forgotten weapon in the battle against antisocial behaviour .
vine : as night falls , off they go again .
this is not once a month , or weekends only , it 's a way of life .
linda : what you doing ?
you 're doing ... just walking about ?
kids : yeah .
linda : have you been to youth club ?
boy : yeah .
linda : have you ?
boy : yeah .
linda : do you like it there or not ?
boy : it 's alright .
boy 2 : it 's good .
linda : is it ?
oh grand .
boy : we have responsibilities and everything in the club and we 're looking after other people .
linda : you 're looking after the streets , are you ?
boys : yeah .
linda : ... and checking in ... checking to see if people are having problems ?
sheila barker perry common community watch we do n't challenge .
we 're not have-a-go heroes , we 're just normal people that care about our community .
vine : and the government wants more of us to be as involved as those birmingham women .
in fact a leaked home office initiative centred on the slogan : " don ? t moan , take action , it 's your street too . "
but that caused confusion among people who say : " well how far are we expected to go when we see violent or antisocial behaviour ? "
you see something happening in the street , do you step in ?
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security the general line must be to get in touch with the authorities straightaway and make sure that , if things are as bad as you paint , that the police will be there as quickly as they can .
vine : you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman , what do you do ?
you retreat and ring the police ?
mcnulty : i think you should in the first instance , it may well be that simply shouting at them , blowing your horn or whatever else deters them and they go away .
vine : he 's now hitting her and the police have n't come .
what do you do then ?
mcnulty : the same ... the same .
vine : you still wait ?
mcnulty : you must get back to the police , try some distractive activities , whatever else .
vine : what , jump up and down ?
mcnulty : but i would say ... well sometimes that may well work .
vine : i 'm confused here because we 're told that your line on this is that people should stop moaning and tackle antisocial behaviour themselves : " it 's your street too . "
mcnulty : but " do n't moan , take action " is about wider communities fully embracing the respect agenda , fully embracing all the elements at their disposal through antisocial behaviour legislation and taking action through those official , formal channels .
vine : well listening to that you have to hope that if you 're ever attacked in the street it 's not the home office minister who happens to be passing , and the whole idea of ringing the police is problematic when the police seem to be overrun in so many areas .
so take carlisle for example , there the housing association has had to enlist what is effectively a private army to help the tenants and deal with the yobs , and i went to see them in action .
young criminals setting fire to front doors right beside some houses .
imagine living next to this , but you certainly would not want to tackle this lot on your own .
what the teenagers didn ? t know was that ex-sas men were filming their activities .
-lsb- filming : night time , hooded youths feeding blaze -rsb- steve harrison carlisle housing association it 's difficult to get evidence when we 're investigating antisocial behaviour where the residents and the victims are feeling intimidated and they do n't want to come forward for fear of repercussions and we thought if we can send them out and go out and gather the evidence from the streets , that would be enough for us to be able to take to court and prove to the court that the nuisance is actually taking place .
tim the surveillance group we have kind of a lot of different types of covert cameras like vision lenses , long-range lenses , not your average hand-held video cameras .
vine : tim 's surveillance group is employed by councils all over the uk , and sometimes even by the police who have n't got time to stake out estates like his ex-soldiers .
tim : a lot of them say they 're just as likely to get injured on the streets of a kind of major uk conurbation as they were in afghanistan or iraq .
the difference is this time it 's a 14 year old or a group of 14 year olds who may or may not happen to be carrying a knife .
steve : it does seem a bit extreme but you have to put yourself in the position of the victims who are suffering day in and day out nuisance , antisocial behaviour , intimidation , threats , noise nuisance , that type of thing , and to live with that every day ... and it can bring an estate down .
vine : and they know if they watch the right people , eventually they will do the wrong thing .
-lsb- filming : youths break into parked vehicle and driving it away -rsb- vine : who are these guys ?
tim : this is a group of youths who have recently turned up in a stolen vehicle .
these two were the ones which have just driven it onto ... into the centre of the park with the lights off .
vine : and there 's something going on here , there 's three young lads and there 's two or three girls , i do n't know what they 're doing actually , i 'm just trying to see .
tim : i think they 're just moving up to enjoy the spectacle .
vine : oh there 's the car , and the group of youths who we 've seen walking along the bank have just walked down to the car , probably opened the petrol cap and just torched it .
they have , however , stripped it of its alloy wheels and very shortly we see them walking back with all of those alloys .
you 'd think they might disperse or run away , frightened of being arrested , but it 's not happening , is it .
tim : it shows how brazen they are .
it shows how brazen they are .
the lack of respect for the police , the lack of respect for the general public seems to be reaching epidemic proportions , and it is very frightening to observe .
vine : i must say it does feel rather strange going out in a 4x4 with a camera and a former special forces man looking for kids who might get out of control .
it 's all about watching .
the metal pole is hard to miss .
but the ex-soldiers wont put themselves in personal danger .
tim : see the activity with girl on there , lighting and striking the light out , heating up the little block of dope .
vine : this is not a scenario in which you 'd want to intervene alone .
tim : not the kind of behaviour you want .
you see if you live in that house there you do n't want kids running all over your wall ...
vine : we 're just listening to the radio here because ...
-lsb- radio -rsb- ... they 're coming in this direction and back the way they came .
vine : we 're just being told there are three guys coming towards us who 've just been fighting , come from down near the bowling alley and we do n't want them to see us in the car so ...
sometimes it 's verbal abuse , sometimes it 's worse , and even though the men filming used to be in special forces , they do n't try to break anything up .
tim : i would advise extreme caution .
invariably we see people coming out and wanting to get involved but they 're putting themselves at quite a great deal of risk .
you know , if we ? re concerned about getting involved they most certainly should be .
they 're just an average joe from the street and they really do have to be very , very careful .
vine : so one thing is clear here , cracking down on thuggery is not only the job of the police , but once we decide it 's our job too , that can have unforeseen consequences .
one man in kent thought he 'd teach a group of local teenagers a lesson they would n't forget and he found himself on the wrong side of the law .
looking at paul , kim and their daughter megan , you would n't guess what they ? ve been through .
paul 's experience proves a cautionary tale if you 're thinking of being a good samaritan .
they used to live above a corner shop where they were constantly being sworn at and threatened by a group of teenage lads with nobody to turn to for help .
kimberley tucker : i was frightened , i was frightened for megan .
i 've been losing sleep .
obviously went to the doctors .
i just could n't eat .
i was just worrying all the time what 's going to happen , what are they going to do next as they threatened to burn down the house with me and megan inside ...
vine : the couple rang the police again and again and specifically said that the shopkeeper , mr patel , had been racially abused , but the trouble carried on .
the youths even taunted paul 's mum and finally he decided he could ignore it no longer .
but on that night you took action .
paul catlow yes .
well the police had done nothing .
they 'd been called at least twice before .
we 'd been to the school about their behaviour .
so i thought enough was enough and i wanted to make a citizen 's arrest .
vine : you pursued them .
paul : i pursued them just up this road here and had all kinds of abuse thrown back at me .
vine : paul and the shopkeeper jumped into their van and found one of the lads hiding in bushes .
paul : i sort of pulled him out and said : " come on " and he struggled with me and then just basically fell to the floor on my feet .
i pulled him up and said : " look , i ? m not going to hurt you , i just want to ... you know , put an end to all this . "
he said : " okay , do n't call the police , i 'll come and apologise to your parents and everyone involved " and that was that .
so we got in the van ...
vine : so he got into the van of his own free will .
paul : yeah , he got in the van .
vine : he volunteered to get in .
paul : yeah , he volunteered to get in the van .
went down to my mum 's , he apologised to her .
carolyn catlow paul ? s mother he said he was sorry .
mr patel said : " now say you 're sorry as though you mean it " i think he meant , so he said : " i ? m really sorry " and he looked really embarrassed .
but paul then said : " well i ? m glad you 've done that .
that ? s it now , let ? s forget it all . "
vine : but he could n't forget it .
the next day when paul was back at his job in the city , the teenager was telling the police he had been kidnapped .
we ca n't name the youths but they were known troublemakers .
paul 's life froze .
he was arrested and charged with kidnap and assault , he even went to prison .
paul : it 's just really a horrible experience really .
you know , i did n't get a lot of sleep at all .
the food was awful , you know , i lost a lot of weight .
and the thing is that was so frustrating , everyone in there said ... you know , they heard my story and they all say ... you know : " we all say we should n't be in here but you really should n't be here . "
and even the gaolers actually told me that as well , you know : " what ?
this is a joke !
what are you doing here ?
it 's appalling . "
vine : paul was bailed after a week , but the louts were waiting with more and more abuse which kim recorded in pages of notes .
the couple rang the police more than 40 times with no result .
after 14 months paul arrived in court .
one of the kids did n't even bother to turn up and the case collapsed .
carolyn : i think the youths have won because they 've got away with it .
they 've just not been punished and they 're out there to do it again and they probably will .
-lsb- vox pops on street -rsb- young woman : but that 's today 's society , is n't it ?
you ca n't do right for doing wrong really , or you ca n't do ... you know , so ...
vine : yeah , so you 're worried you get involved you might get on the wrong end of the law .
girl : yeah , i mean ... well it 's just ... and there 's so many loopholes to everything , you know .
what can and ca n't you do as ... you know , a citizen of society , you know , you just do n't know really .
vine : do you fear that in a situation where you got involved and you went in physically to stop something , do you worry the police might turn up and arrest you ?
man : yes , definitely .
vine : why do you worry about that ?
man : because that 's what happens , is n't it ?
if you 're under 16 and your first claim is to say : " i was hit , i was doing nothing , he 's an adult .. "
rah di rah di rah ... and you read about it all the time .
vine : we asked to interview the police officers involved in paul catlow 's case , but they said no .
the met told us they did n't comment on criminal justice matters .
when you hear that story , minister , you must think : " why do bother ? "
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security well not quite , i do feel that sometimes when i read newspapers , but whatever the provocation , however much someone has irritated or annoyed , i have to take it back in some circumstances , again through frustration or whatever else , and violently seeking to get redress ...
vine : he did n't use violence ... he came in his van to apologise .
i mean this poor guy , he 's had 18 months knocked out of his life .
mcnulty : ah but if you turn round ...
i do n't want to dwell on the specific case , but most people with commonsense would say that that needs at least a cursory investigation .
now i know in this particular case it was longer , but people would i think be ... look awry at the police if they did n't at least look into the circumstances and context of that .
vine : but come on , it 's just commonsense , this is .
you know , the idea the police turn up and have to investigate the law-abiding citizen who took action it 's just pc plod is n't it ?
surely they can see the situation .
mcnulty : more often than not in these cases commonsense has prevailed once the context has been fully understood .
vine : it just seems to be easier for the police to arrest the law-abiding citizen and get him into court because they know he 'll turn up .
mcnulty : i understand that , i understand people 's frustration too .
but things must be done through the appropriate channels .
paul : actually no , because they 're under 18 they 're untouchable and the police have admitted that to me as well .
one police community officer actually said the boy involved needed a good kicking , and i actually turned round and said to her : " this is a new safer neighbourhood scheme ... is this what you call a safer neighbourhood , encouraging people to go out and kick them in ? "
i said : " i have n't even done that and look how i 've ended up .
so could you imagine if i did do that and take your advice , what would happen ? "
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : do you regret being a good samaritan ?
paul : no , i think if everyone sort of ... you know , sat back and let these kids get on with it because of the way the law stands , i think we 'd be heading for quite a disaster .
i think it needs people to stand up to these yobs and go out there and take action .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- pauline cowan tom noble 's partner if we ignore things and just let them get away with it , we are turning to be as bad as what they are and it 's not a society that you want to live in .
you want it to be a better society so you 've got to go out and help each other because if you do n't these yobs are definitely going to win , they 're going to take over .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : well that 's all for this week , but don ? t forget you can join the argument on my radio 2 show at midday each day and also please do email us here at panorama if there ? s anything you want us to investigate .

panorama should i fight back ?
recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 5:02:07 jeremy vine : good evening .
i 'm jeremy vine and this is panorama .
two robbers with knives attack an elderly newsagent .
he instinctively fights back .
is he a hero or just plain foolish ?
put yourself in this man 's shoes , he went to the aid of two teenagers being attacked by a gang .
do you join in or walk on by ?
you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman .
what do you do ?
do you retreat and ring the police ?
it 's a split second decision that any of us could face at any time , whether to intervene or turn away .
it 's happened to me , maybe it 's happened to you .
tonight we 're asking if we do n't take action when we see crime and antisocial behaviour happening right in front of our eyes , who will ?
i 've been meeting people who have fought back against criminals with vastly different consequences , but as individuals just what is the right thing to do when we are confronted by violence or antisocial behaviour ?
stoke on trent here an armed robber runs into a busy post office .
robber : oi , put the money in the bag .
put the money in the bag or you get it through the head .
now .
quick !
vine : kym ledgar , the sub-postmistress was terrified .
kym ledgar : i saw this figure all in black , and could n't even see like the whites of his eyes , and he 'd got the shotgun , he 'd pointed it at me and then he moved it to customer and he said , in a very threatening strong voice : robber : put the money in the bag .
manager : give him the money kim .
robber : put the money in the f * * * ing bag .
quick !
kim : so i just got up and did exactly as he said .
vine : her husband , barry , a former soldier , walked straight into the middle of the robbery .
barry : it was an instant decision .
well we came into contact right by the counter here .
he started to turn , i grabbed hold of the barrel of the shotgun and as he turned , with the my other hand i grabbed his collar .
vine : barry , in beige , grabbed the robber who 's wearing a hood .
kim : i remember giving out a blood-curdling scream because i thought i could well lose him .
barry : he was pulling away , i was pushing .
it was a struggle for the gun , control of the gun .
kim : i knew barry would n't let go .
i just knew how determined he would be .
i was just in fear of his life .
barry : and we bounced off one or two of the walls and then he threatened to kill me , all part and parcel of it .
then he let go of the gun and leapt up and he was out through the door .
vine : barry , who has a serious heart condition , cracked a rib in the vicious struggle .
kim : i thought i might have lost him actually .
he 'd gone an ashen colour and his lips had gone purple , and i was very , very concerned that he was going to have a heart attack .
vine : the robber was sasha markovic , a heroin addict and persistent offender .
barry was awarded a bravery medal by the police but confusingly they tell others not to follow his example .
chief inspector paul clews staffordshire police we generally advise in such a serious incident like that people should n't get involved , but i 'd certainly not be critical of barry for his bravery .
vine : for barry it 's not really about bravery , he feels he simply ca n't look on while the family post office is targeted by robbers .
four times its happened in 15 years .
so next time ?
barry : if i was confronted by a criminal in similar circumstances i would hope i would do the same .
it depends on the situation .
it 's not something you can give a general advice to .
if you can avoid it , then by all means if you think it 's dangerous , do n't do it .
phone the police and let the police handle it , they 're trained for it .
vine : just 34 % of us would stop teenagers vandalising a bus shelter compared to 65 % of germans and 52 % of spaniards .
armed with some disturbing cctv footage i decided to do my own research with the public .
-lsb- vox pops on the street -rsb- man : i 'd have thought if he 's got a weapon , get out .
vine : yeah ?
man : mmm .
man 2 : if ever i saw that , probably i do n't fight back , no , i 'd run .
vine : the knife ?
man 2 : a knife .
i might fight back .
woman : i do n't know if i 'd physically walk over to them .
i mean i might scream out and say : " what are you doing ? "
i definitely would phone the police .
sunderland vine : but you ca n't always be sure the police will get there in time , and if you 're on an estate like this one and there are gangs involved and it 's just you , the stakes can be very high .
in the end , for lots of people , stepping forward is a snap judgement , it 's instantaneous and , for some , it 's disastrous .
-lsb- home video -rsb- tom : this is the first of january 1902 .
child : 2004 !
tom : 2004 , alright , i stand corrected .
vine : a happy family scene , but tom noble 's children don ? t have a father anymore .
he was a builder and a fit man , and a year after this was filmed he thought he could help a young girl who was being attacked by teenagers in his street .
geoff bird tom 's friend tom walked straight in amongst all of them and asked what was going on and one lad said : " and what are you going to do about it ? " sort of thing , he was the tallest lad of the group .
and i mean tom was ex-army and he was n't sort of phased by anybody , certainly nobody like that , and he squared up to the lad and said ... you know : " i ? m out here to sort it out " and the lad turned and ran away .
tom turned to face myself and as he walked back towards me , the lad ran up behind him and punched him in the back of the neck .
i saw the look in his eye , he was looking directly at me when the blow hit him in the neck and he died before he hit the ground .
so ... that 's it .
vine : as paramedics fought to save him , pauline , tom 's partner of 12 years , watched .
but the punch had severed an artery in his neck .
pauline cowan they gave like an injection and then i saw the machine go ... the machine went ' beep ' like that and then it went flat then , and that 's when i sort of got quite a shock .
i sort of went : " oh no " and they said " no " and kept on working on him .
vine : fifty-two year old tom was rushed to hospital .
two days later they switched off his life support .
geoff : tom was my best friend .
there was nobody else could come close to that .
it was just a terrible loss .
vine : the killer was 16 , a schoolboy , gary prescott .
he was already on an asbo for criminal damage and drunkenness .
in fact it 's thought the police had stopped him one hour before the attack , but they did n't take him in .
now they 've charged him with manslaughter and pauline was determined to face him in court .
pauline : and i just had to stare at him and stare at him because i just felt ... you know , i want you to look at me and see what ... you 've robbed me of my life .
you took tom 's life but you 've also took my life away .
vine : and here there is a cruel lesson for good samaritans .
tom 's attacker got three years in prison .
no , make that 18 months after an early release .
geoff : it was typical of tom , it was typical of any of us , myself , my wife , we would have all done the same thing .
it just happened that tom was the first one there .
but yeah , he would have helped anybody .
vine : what about the killer ?
his family did n't want to be shown , but we spoke to them .
prescott 's father says he 's sorry tom died but it 's his own fault because he chose to have a go .
prescott snr : a grown man , he were n't a teenager .
what 's he going to be thinking ?
it 's either you 're gonna get hit or he 's gonna get it , but there was no malice in it .
vine : no malice !
prescott ? s grandmother , sylvia hope , is sorry but says she would have done the same as her grandson .
sylvia hope : if anybody was coming at me i would have done the same .
i 'm sorry , but anybody who was coming at me , and i thought somebody was going to throw a punch at me , well i would go forward first .
vine : tom was killed for trying to do the right thing , so pauline has been thinking it through .
was it right when the cost of taking action was so high ?
it 's now nearly two years since tom died and she 's come to maybe a surprising conclusion .
pauline : i 'm pleased tom did what he did .
obviously the consequences were awful , but i still think that i would do it myself if i saw someone getting hurt i would go out and do something , and i think people should , you know , i mean i don ? t want people to go out and obviously lose their lives and things like that , but if some innocent person is getting hurt people 's got to help them .
-lsb- street vox pops -rsb- vine : what do you do ?
man : it 's a tough decision , is n't it ?
it depends on how many people are about , whether you 're ... yeah , if you can handle yourself and you think you can take control of the situation , yeah , i think you do .
woman : i usually do intervene .
vine : what do you do ?
woman : well i usually say : " i think you 're being silly " you know " why don ? t you just go home ? " or something like that .
man 2 : i have done in the past and it ended up with ...
i don ? t know if you can see it .
vine : let 's have a look .
oh yeah , you 've got a scar there .
man 2 : yeah , i 've got a scar , i 've got another one here where i intervened in a pub .
a friend of mine , he lost his leg through it .
vine : and what happened there , a pub fight was it ?
man 2 : we were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
vine : the government 's big idea is for us all to be doing something before the trouble starts where we live .
that 's their ' respect ' agenda .
' give respect , get respect ' is the slogan .
it 's all about tackling antisocial behaviour before it 's taken root .
now picture that .
in fact you do n't have to picture it , we can show you it .
birmingham -lsb- video footage -rsb- linda and michelle , mary and sheila , they probably would n't want to be called the b team but they are in birmingham .
there 's strength in numbers and the women had all joined together to fight back against antisocial behaviour without having to risk going it alone .
linda : can you go over there now because there 's been some problem with fly-tipping over there .
wagons roll .
have you got your torches guys ?
there 's a television been dumped .
we 'll get it moved tomorrow .
mary : why oh why do people do it ?
people keep dumping things .
linda : i know .
let 's start leafleting guys , now .
vine : a few years ago being out after dark on the perry common estate would not be recommended .
thugs ruled .
decent residents lived in terror .
mary : i was more angry than frightened .
there was n't a night went by when we did n't have one of our windows put through .
but rather scary been sitting in your armchair and having glass all of a sudden come over you .
i was very , very angry .
michelle ashmore perry common community watch it became a no go zone and there was rat runs and we were having speeding cars and smashing them up on the ... like straight into the trees , and then you 'd got a car ... a wrecked car on the public open spaces and things , so i think the fear of crime rose quite a lot and people would n't walk the streets after sort of 6 o 'clock at night .
vine : and what these women had done by getting involved is right up the government 's street .
last year mr blair launched his respect agenda with a splash , it 's to empower us ordinary citizens to tackle antisocial behaviour ourselves and not just leave it to the police and other authorities .
tony blair : what 's important obviously is to give the local communities the powers that they need to crack down on antisocial behaviour .
vine : it 's easy to laugh at a neighbourhood watch scheme on wheels but here burglaries have dropped by 42 % in three years and car crime by nearly 30 % .
and our active citizens are toasted .
they go to conferences .
on stage here in bristol the government 's so-called respect tzar louise casey tells them what they already know .
lousie casey : the public are the most important ... the most important , the most crucial , and indeed , if i dare say it , the sometimes forgotten weapon in the battle against antisocial behaviour .
vine : as night falls , off they go again .
this is not once a month , or weekends only , it 's a way of life .
linda : what you doing ?
you 're doing ... just walking about ?
kids : yeah .
linda : have you been to youth club ?
boy : yeah .
linda : have you ?
boy : yeah .
linda : do you like it there or not ?
boy : it 's alright .
boy 2 : it 's good .
linda : is it ?
oh grand .
boy : we have responsibilities and everything in the club and we 're looking after other people .
linda : you 're looking after the streets , are you ?
boys : yeah .
linda : ... and checking in ... checking to see if people are having problems ?
sheila barker perry common community watch we do n't challenge .
we 're not have-a-go heroes , we 're just normal people that care about our community .
vine : and the government wants more of us to be as involved as those birmingham women .
in fact a leaked home office initiative centred on the slogan : " don ? t moan , take action , it 's your street too . "
but that caused confusion among people who say : " well how far are we expected to go when we see violent or antisocial behaviour ? "
you see something happening in the street , do you step in ?
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security the general line must be to get in touch with the authorities straightaway and make sure that , if things are as bad as you paint , that the police will be there as quickly as they can .
vine : you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman , what do you do ?
you retreat and ring the police ?
mcnulty : i think you should in the first instance , it may well be that simply shouting at them , blowing your horn or whatever else deters them and they go away .
vine : he 's now hitting her and the police have n't come .
what do you do then ?
mcnulty : the same ... the same .
vine : you still wait ?
mcnulty : you must get back to the police , try some distractive activities , whatever else .
vine : what , jump up and down ?
mcnulty : but i would say ... well sometimes that may well work .
vine : i 'm confused here because we 're told that your line on this is that people should stop moaning and tackle antisocial behaviour themselves : " it 's your street too . "
mcnulty : but " do n't moan , take action " is about wider communities fully embracing the respect agenda , fully embracing all the elements at their disposal through antisocial behaviour legislation and taking action through those official , formal channels .
vine : well listening to that you have to hope that if you 're ever attacked in the street it 's not the home office minister who happens to be passing , and the whole idea of ringing the police is problematic when the police seem to be overrun in so many areas .
so take carlisle for example , there the housing association has had to enlist what is effectively a private army to help the tenants and deal with the yobs , and i went to see them in action .
young criminals setting fire to front doors right beside some houses .
imagine living next to this , but you certainly would not want to tackle this lot on your own .
what the teenagers didn ? t know was that ex-sas men were filming their activities .
-lsb- filming : night time , hooded youths feeding blaze -rsb- steve harrison carlisle housing association it 's difficult to get evidence when we 're investigating antisocial behaviour where the residents and the victims are feeling intimidated and they do n't want to come forward for fear of repercussions and we thought if we can send them out and go out and gather the evidence from the streets , that would be enough for us to be able to take to court and prove to the court that the nuisance is actually taking place .
tim the surveillance group we have kind of a lot of different types of covert cameras like vision lenses , long-range lenses , not your average hand-held video cameras .
vine : tim 's surveillance group is employed by councils all over the uk , and sometimes even by the police who have n't got time to stake out estates like his ex-soldiers .
tim : a lot of them say they 're just as likely to get injured on the streets of a kind of major uk conurbation as they were in afghanistan or iraq .
the difference is this time it 's a 14 year old or a group of 14 year olds who may or may not happen to be carrying a knife .
steve : it does seem a bit extreme but you have to put yourself in the position of the victims who are suffering day in and day out nuisance , antisocial behaviour , intimidation , threats , noise nuisance , that type of thing , and to live with that every day ... and it can bring an estate down .
vine : and they know if they watch the right people , eventually they will do the wrong thing .
-lsb- filming : youths break into parked vehicle and driving it away -rsb- vine : who are these guys ?
tim : this is a group of youths who have recently turned up in a stolen vehicle .
these two were the ones which have just driven it onto ... into the centre of the park with the lights off .

tim : i think they 're just moving up to enjoy the spectacle .
vine : oh there 's the car , and the group of youths who we 've seen walking along the bank have just walked down to the car , probably opened the petrol cap and just torched it .
they have , however , stripped it of its alloy wheels and very shortly we see them walking back with all of those alloys .
you 'd think they might disperse or run away , frightened of being arrested , but it 's not happening , is it .
tim : it shows how brazen they are .
it shows how brazen they are .
the lack of respect for the police , the lack of respect for the general public seems to be reaching epidemic proportions , and it is very frightening to observe .
vine : i must say it does feel rather strange going out in a 4x4 with a camera and a former special forces man looking for kids who might get out of control .
it 's all about watching .
the metal pole is hard to miss .
but the ex-soldiers wont put themselves in personal danger .
tim : see the activity with girl on there , lighting and striking the light out , heating up the little block of dope .
vine : this is not a scenario in which you 'd want to intervene alone .
tim : not the kind of behaviour you want .
you see if you live in that house there you do n't want kids running all over your wall ...
vine : we 're just listening to the radio here because ...
-lsb- radio -rsb- ... they 're coming in this direction and back the way they came .
vine : we 're just being told there are three guys coming towards us who 've just been fighting , come from down near the bowling alley and we do n't want them to see us in the car so ...
sometimes it 's verbal abuse , sometimes it 's worse , and even though the men filming used to be in special forces , they do n't try to break anything up .
tim : i would advise extreme caution .
invariably we see people coming out and wanting to get involved but they 're putting themselves at quite a great deal of risk .
you know , if we ? re concerned about getting involved they most certainly should be .
they 're just an average joe from the street and they really do have to be very , very careful .
vine : so one thing is clear here , cracking down on thuggery is not only the job of the police , but once we decide it 's our job too , that can have unforeseen consequences .
one man in kent thought he 'd teach a group of local teenagers a lesson they would n't forget and he found himself on the wrong side of the law .
looking at paul , kim and their daughter megan , you would n't guess what they ? ve been through .
paul 's experience proves a cautionary tale if you 're thinking of being a good samaritan .
they used to live above a corner shop where they were constantly being sworn at and threatened by a group of teenage lads with nobody to turn to for help .
kimberley tucker : i was frightened , i was frightened for megan .
i 've been losing sleep .
obviously went to the doctors .
i just could n't eat .
i was just worrying all the time what 's going to happen , what are they going to do next as they threatened to burn down the house with me and megan inside ...
vine : the couple rang the police again and again and specifically said that the shopkeeper , mr patel , had been racially abused , but the trouble carried on .
the youths even taunted paul 's mum and finally he decided he could ignore it no longer .
but on that night you took action .
paul catlow yes .
well the police had done nothing .
they 'd been called at least twice before .
we 'd been to the school about their behaviour .
so i thought enough was enough and i wanted to make a citizen 's arrest .
vine : you pursued them .
paul : i pursued them just up this road here and had all kinds of abuse thrown back at me .
vine : paul and the shopkeeper jumped into their van and found one of the lads hiding in bushes .
paul : i sort of pulled him out and said : " come on " and he struggled with me and then just basically fell to the floor on my feet .
i pulled him up and said : " look , i ? m not going to hurt you , i just want to ... you know , put an end to all this . "
he said : " okay , do n't call the police , i 'll come and apologise to your parents and everyone involved " and that was that .
so we got in the van ...
vine : so he got into the van of his own free will .
paul : yeah , he got in the van .
vine : he volunteered to get in .
paul : yeah , he volunteered to get in the van .
went down to my mum 's , he apologised to her .
carolyn catlow paul ? s mother he said he was sorry .
mr patel said : " now say you 're sorry as though you mean it " i think he meant , so he said : " i ? m really sorry " and he looked really embarrassed .
but paul then said : " well i ? m glad you 've done that .
that ? s it now , let ? s forget it all . "
vine : but he could n't forget it .
the next day when paul was back at his job in the city , the teenager was telling the police he had been kidnapped .
we ca n't name the youths but they were known troublemakers .
paul 's life froze .
he was arrested and charged with kidnap and assault , he even went to prison .
paul : it 's just really a horrible experience really .
you know , i did n't get a lot of sleep at all .
the food was awful , you know , i lost a lot of weight .
and the thing is that was so frustrating , everyone in there said ... you know , they heard my story and they all say ... you know : " we all say we should n't be in here but you really should n't be here . "
and even the gaolers actually told me that as well , you know : " what ?
this is a joke !
what are you doing here ?
it 's appalling . "
vine : paul was bailed after a week , but the louts were waiting with more and more abuse which kim recorded in pages of notes .
the couple rang the police more than 40 times with no result .
after 14 months paul arrived in court .
one of the kids did n't even bother to turn up and the case collapsed .
carolyn : i think the youths have won because they 've got away with it .
they 've just not been punished and they 're out there to do it again and they probably will .
-lsb- vox pops on street -rsb- young woman : but that 's today 's society , is n't it ?
you ca n't do right for doing wrong really , or you ca n't do ... you know , so ...
vine : yeah , so you 're worried you get involved you might get on the wrong end of the law .
girl : yeah , i mean ... well it 's just ... and there 's so many loopholes to everything , you know .
what can and ca n't you do as ... you know , a citizen of society , you know , you just do n't know really .
vine : do you fear that in a situation where you got involved and you went in physically to stop something , do you worry the police might turn up and arrest you ?
man : yes , definitely .
vine : why do you worry about that ?
man : because that 's what happens , is n't it ?
if you 're under 16 and your first claim is to say : " i was hit , i was doing nothing , he 's an adult .. "
rah di rah di rah ... and you read about it all the time .
vine : we asked to interview the police officers involved in paul catlow 's case , but they said no .
the met told us they did n't comment on criminal justice matters .
when you hear that story , minister , you must think : " why do bother ? "
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security well not quite , i do feel that sometimes when i read newspapers , but whatever the provocation , however much someone has irritated or annoyed , i have to take it back in some circumstances , again through frustration or whatever else , and violently seeking to get redress ...
vine : he did n't use violence ... he came in his van to apologise .
i mean this poor guy , he 's had 18 months knocked out of his life .
mcnulty : ah but if you turn round ...
i do n't want to dwell on the specific case , but most people with commonsense would say that that needs at least a cursory investigation .
now i know in this particular case it was longer , but people would i think be ... look awry at the police if they did n't at least look into the circumstances and context of that .
vine : but come on , it 's just commonsense , this is .
you know , the idea the police turn up and have to investigate the law-abiding citizen who took action it 's just pc plod is n't it ?
surely they can see the situation .
mcnulty : more often than not in these cases commonsense has prevailed once the context has been fully understood .
vine : it just seems to be easier for the police to arrest the law-abiding citizen and get him into court because they know he 'll turn up .
mcnulty : i understand that , i understand people 's frustration too .
but things must be done through the appropriate channels .
paul : actually no , because they 're under 18 they 're untouchable and the police have admitted that to me as well .
one police community officer actually said the boy involved needed a good kicking , and i actually turned round and said to her : " this is a new safer neighbourhood scheme ... is this what you call a safer neighbourhood , encouraging people to go out and kick them in ? "
i said : " i have n't even done that and look how i 've ended up .
so could you imagine if i did do that and take your advice , what would happen ? "
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : do you regret being a good samaritan ?
paul : no , i think if everyone sort of ... you know , sat back and let these kids get on with it because of the way the law stands , i think we 'd be heading for quite a disaster .
i think it needs people to stand up to these yobs and go out there and take action .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- pauline cowan tom noble 's partner if we ignore things and just let them get away with it , we are turning to be as bad as what they are and it 's not a society that you want to live in .
you want it to be a better society so you 've got to go out and help each other because if you do n't these yobs are definitely going to win , they 're going to take over .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : well that 's all for this week , but don ? t forget you can join the argument on my radio 2 show at midday each day and also please do email us here at panorama if there ? s anything you want us to investigate .

panorama should i fight back ?
recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 5:02:07 jeremy vine : good evening .
i 'm jeremy vine and this is panorama .
two robbers with knives attack an elderly newsagent .
he instinctively fights back .
is he a hero or just plain foolish ?
put yourself in this man 's shoes , he went to the aid of two teenagers being attacked by a gang .
do you join in or walk on by ?
you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman .
what do you do ?
do you retreat and ring the police ?
it 's a split second decision that any of us could face at any time , whether to intervene or turn away .
it 's happened to me , maybe it 's happened to you .
tonight we 're asking if we do n't take action when we see crime and antisocial behaviour happening right in front of our eyes , who will ?
i 've been meeting people who have fought back against criminals with vastly different consequences , but as individuals just what is the right thing to do when we are confronted by violence or antisocial behaviour ?
stoke on trent here an armed robber runs into a busy post office .
robber : oi , put the money in the bag .
put the money in the bag or you get it through the head .
now .
quick !
vine : kym ledgar , the sub-postmistress was terrified .
kym ledgar : i saw this figure all in black , and could n't even see like the whites of his eyes , and he 'd got the shotgun , he 'd pointed it at me and then he moved it to customer and he said , in a very threatening strong voice : robber : put the money in the bag .
manager : give him the money kim .
robber : put the money in the f * * * ing bag .
quick !
kim : so i just got up and did exactly as he said .
vine : her husband , barry , a former soldier , walked straight into the middle of the robbery .
barry : it was an instant decision .
well we came into contact right by the counter here .
he started to turn , i grabbed hold of the barrel of the shotgun and as he turned , with the my other hand i grabbed his collar .
vine : barry , in beige , grabbed the robber who 's wearing a hood .
kim : i remember giving out a blood-curdling scream because i thought i could well lose him .
barry : he was pulling away , i was pushing .
it was a struggle for the gun , control of the gun .
kim : i knew barry would n't let go .
i just knew how determined he would be .
i was just in fear of his life .
barry : and we bounced off one or two of the walls and then he threatened to kill me , all part and parcel of it .
then he let go of the gun and leapt up and he was out through the door .
vine : barry , who has a serious heart condition , cracked a rib in the vicious struggle .
kim : i thought i might have lost him actually .
he 'd gone an ashen colour and his lips had gone purple , and i was very , very concerned that he was going to have a heart attack .
vine : the robber was sasha markovic , a heroin addict and persistent offender .
barry was awarded a bravery medal by the police but confusingly they tell others not to follow his example .
chief inspector paul clews staffordshire police we generally advise in such a serious incident like that people should n't get involved , but i 'd certainly not be critical of barry for his bravery .
vine : for barry it 's not really about bravery , he feels he simply ca n't look on while the family post office is targeted by robbers .
four times its happened in 15 years .
so next time ?
barry : if i was confronted by a criminal in similar circumstances i would hope i would do the same .
it depends on the situation .
it 's not something you can give a general advice to .
if you can avoid it , then by all means if you think it 's dangerous , do n't do it .
phone the police and let the police handle it , they 're trained for it .
vine : just 34 % of us would stop teenagers vandalising a bus shelter compared to 65 % of germans and 52 % of spaniards .
armed with some disturbing cctv footage i decided to do my own research with the public .
-lsb- vox pops on the street -rsb- man : i 'd have thought if he 's got a weapon , get out .
vine : yeah ?
man : mmm .
man 2 : if ever i saw that , probably i do n't fight back , no , i 'd run .
vine : the knife ?
man 2 : a knife .
i might fight back .
woman : i do n't know if i 'd physically walk over to them .
i mean i might scream out and say : " what are you doing ? "
i definitely would phone the police .
sunderland vine : but you ca n't always be sure the police will get there in time , and if you 're on an estate like this one and there are gangs involved and it 's just you , the stakes can be very high .
in the end , for lots of people , stepping forward is a snap judgement , it 's instantaneous and , for some , it 's disastrous .
-lsb- home video -rsb- tom : this is the first of january 1902 .
child : 2004 !
tom : 2004 , alright , i stand corrected .
vine : a happy family scene , but tom noble 's children don ? t have a father anymore .
he was a builder and a fit man , and a year after this was filmed he thought he could help a young girl who was being attacked by teenagers in his street .
geoff bird tom 's friend tom walked straight in amongst all of them and asked what was going on and one lad said : " and what are you going to do about it ? " sort of thing , he was the tallest lad of the group .
and i mean tom was ex-army and he was n't sort of phased by anybody , certainly nobody like that , and he squared up to the lad and said ... you know : " i ? m out here to sort it out " and the lad turned and ran away .
tom turned to face myself and as he walked back towards me , the lad ran up behind him and punched him in the back of the neck .
i saw the look in his eye , he was looking directly at me when the blow hit him in the neck and he died before he hit the ground .
so ... that 's it .
vine : as paramedics fought to save him , pauline , tom 's partner of 12 years , watched .
but the punch had severed an artery in his neck .
pauline cowan they gave like an injection and then i saw the machine go ... the machine went ' beep ' like that and then it went flat then , and that 's when i sort of got quite a shock .
i sort of went : " oh no " and they said " no " and kept on working on him .
vine : fifty-two year old tom was rushed to hospital .
two days later they switched off his life support .
geoff : tom was my best friend .
there was nobody else could come close to that .
it was just a terrible loss .
vine : the killer was 16 , a schoolboy , gary prescott .
he was already on an asbo for criminal damage and drunkenness .
in fact it 's thought the police had stopped him one hour before the attack , but they did n't take him in .
now they 've charged him with manslaughter and pauline was determined to face him in court .
pauline : and i just had to stare at him and stare at him because i just felt ... you know , i want you to look at me and see what ... you 've robbed me of my life .
you took tom 's life but you 've also took my life away .
vine : and here there is a cruel lesson for good samaritans .
tom 's attacker got three years in prison .
no , make that 18 months after an early release .
geoff : it was typical of tom , it was typical of any of us , myself , my wife , we would have all done the same thing .
it just happened that tom was the first one there .
but yeah , he would have helped anybody .
vine : what about the killer ?
his family did n't want to be shown , but we spoke to them .
prescott 's father says he 's sorry tom died but it 's his own fault because he chose to have a go .
prescott snr : a grown man , he were n't a teenager .
what 's he going to be thinking ?
it 's either you 're gonna get hit or he 's gonna get it , but there was no malice in it .
vine : no malice !
prescott ? s grandmother , sylvia hope , is sorry but says she would have done the same as her grandson .
sylvia hope : if anybody was coming at me i would have done the same .
i 'm sorry , but anybody who was coming at me , and i thought somebody was going to throw a punch at me , well i would go forward first .
vine : tom was killed for trying to do the right thing , so pauline has been thinking it through .
was it right when the cost of taking action was so high ?
it 's now nearly two years since tom died and she 's come to maybe a surprising conclusion .
pauline : i 'm pleased tom did what he did .
obviously the consequences were awful , but i still think that i would do it myself if i saw someone getting hurt i would go out and do something , and i think people should , you know , i mean i don ? t want people to go out and obviously lose their lives and things like that , but if some innocent person is getting hurt people 's got to help them .
-lsb- street vox pops -rsb- vine : what do you do ?
man : it 's a tough decision , is n't it ?
it depends on how many people are about , whether you 're ... yeah , if you can handle yourself and you think you can take control of the situation , yeah , i think you do .
woman : i usually do intervene .
vine : what do you do ?
woman : well i usually say : " i think you 're being silly " you know " why don ? t you just go home ? " or something like that .
man 2 : i have done in the past and it ended up with ...
i don ? t know if you can see it .
vine : let 's have a look .
oh yeah , you 've got a scar there .
man 2 : yeah , i 've got a scar , i 've got another one here where i intervened in a pub .
a friend of mine , he lost his leg through it .
vine : and what happened there , a pub fight was it ?
man 2 : we were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
vine : the government 's big idea is for us all to be doing something before the trouble starts where we live .
that 's their ' respect ' agenda .
' give respect , get respect ' is the slogan .
it 's all about tackling antisocial behaviour before it 's taken root .
now picture that .
in fact you do n't have to picture it , we can show you it .
birmingham -lsb- video footage -rsb- linda and michelle , mary and sheila , they probably would n't want to be called the b team but they are in birmingham .
there 's strength in numbers and the women had all joined together to fight back against antisocial behaviour without having to risk going it alone .
linda : can you go over there now because there 's been some problem with fly-tipping over there .
wagons roll .
have you got your torches guys ?
there 's a television been dumped .
we 'll get it moved tomorrow .
mary : why oh why do people do it ?
people keep dumping things .
linda : i know .
let 's start leafleting guys , now .
vine : a few years ago being out after dark on the perry common estate would not be recommended .
thugs ruled .
decent residents lived in terror .
mary : i was more angry than frightened .
there was n't a night went by when we did n't have one of our windows put through .
but rather scary been sitting in your armchair and having glass all of a sudden come over you .
i was very , very angry .
michelle ashmore perry common community watch it became a no go zone and there was rat runs and we were having speeding cars and smashing them up on the ... like straight into the trees , and then you 'd got a car ... a wrecked car on the public open spaces and things , so i think the fear of crime rose quite a lot and people would n't walk the streets after sort of 6 o 'clock at night .
vine : and what these women had done by getting involved is right up the government 's street .
last year mr blair launched his respect agenda with a splash , it 's to empower us ordinary citizens to tackle antisocial behaviour ourselves and not just leave it to the police and other authorities .
tony blair : what 's important obviously is to give the local communities the powers that they need to crack down on antisocial behaviour .
vine : it 's easy to laugh at a neighbourhood watch scheme on wheels but here burglaries have dropped by 42 % in three years and car crime by nearly 30 % .
and our active citizens are toasted .
they go to conferences .
on stage here in bristol the government 's so-called respect tzar louise casey tells them what they already know .
lousie casey : the public are the most important ... the most important , the most crucial , and indeed , if i dare say it , the sometimes forgotten weapon in the battle against antisocial behaviour .
vine : as night falls , off they go again .
this is not once a month , or weekends only , it 's a way of life .
linda : what you doing ?
you 're doing ... just walking about ?
kids : yeah .
linda : have you been to youth club ?
boy : yeah .
linda : have you ?
boy : yeah .
linda : do you like it there or not ?
boy : it 's alright .
boy 2 : it 's good .
linda : is it ?
oh grand .
boy : we have responsibilities and everything in the club and we 're looking after other people .
linda : you 're looking after the streets , are you ?
boys : yeah .
linda : ... and checking in ... checking to see if people are having problems ?
sheila barker perry common community watch we do n't challenge .
we 're not have-a-go heroes , we 're just normal people that care about our community .
vine : and the government wants more of us to be as involved as those birmingham women .
in fact a leaked home office initiative centred on the slogan : " don ? t moan , take action , it 's your street too . "
but that caused confusion among people who say : " well how far are we expected to go when we see violent or antisocial behaviour ? "
you see something happening in the street , do you step in ?
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security the general line must be to get in touch with the authorities straightaway and make sure that , if things are as bad as you paint , that the police will be there as quickly as they can .
vine : you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman , what do you do ?
you retreat and ring the police ?
mcnulty : i think you should in the first instance , it may well be that simply shouting at them , blowing your horn or whatever else deters them and they go away .
vine : he 's now hitting her and the police have n't come .
what do you do then ?
mcnulty : the same ... the same .
vine : you still wait ?
mcnulty : you must get back to the police , try some distractive activities , whatever else .
vine : what , jump up and down ?
mcnulty : but i would say ... well sometimes that may well work .
vine : i 'm confused here because we 're told that your line on this is that people should stop moaning and tackle antisocial behaviour themselves : " it 's your street too . "
mcnulty : but " do n't moan , take action " is about wider communities fully embracing the respect agenda , fully embracing all the elements at their disposal through antisocial behaviour legislation and taking action through those official , formal channels .
vine : well listening to that you have to hope that if you 're ever attacked in the street it 's not the home office minister who happens to be passing , and the whole idea of ringing the police is problematic when the police seem to be overrun in so many areas .
so take carlisle for example , there the housing association has had to enlist what is effectively a private army to help the tenants and deal with the yobs , and i went to see them in action .
young criminals setting fire to front doors right beside some houses .
imagine living next to this , but you certainly would not want to tackle this lot on your own .
what the teenagers didn ? t know was that ex-sas men were filming their activities .
-lsb- filming : night time , hooded youths feeding blaze -rsb- steve harrison carlisle housing association it 's difficult to get evidence when we 're investigating antisocial behaviour where the residents and the victims are feeling intimidated and they do n't want to come forward for fear of repercussions and we thought if we can send them out and go out and gather the evidence from the streets , that would be enough for us to be able to take to court and prove to the court that the nuisance is actually taking place .
tim the surveillance group we have kind of a lot of different types of covert cameras like vision lenses , long-range lenses , not your average hand-held video cameras .
vine : tim 's surveillance group is employed by councils all over the uk , and sometimes even by the police who have n't got time to stake out estates like his ex-soldiers .
tim : a lot of them say they 're just as likely to get injured on the streets of a kind of major uk conurbation as they were in afghanistan or iraq .
the difference is this time it 's a 14 year old or a group of 14 year olds who may or may not happen to be carrying a knife .
steve : it does seem a bit extreme but you have to put yourself in the position of the victims who are suffering day in and day out nuisance , antisocial behaviour , intimidation , threats , noise nuisance , that type of thing , and to live with that every day ... and it can bring an estate down .
vine : and they know if they watch the right people , eventually they will do the wrong thing .
-lsb- filming : youths break into parked vehicle and driving it away -rsb- vine : who are these guys ?
tim : this is a group of youths who have recently turned up in a stolen vehicle .
these two were the ones which have just driven it onto ... into the centre of the park with the lights off .
vine : and there 's something going on here , there 's three young lads and there 's two or three girls , i do n't know what they 're doing actually , i 'm just trying to see .
tim : i think they 're just moving up to enjoy the spectacle .
vine : oh there 's the car , and the group of youths who we 've seen walking along the bank have just walked down to the car , probably opened the petrol cap and just torched it .
they have , however , stripped it of its alloy wheels and very shortly we see them walking back with all of those alloys .
you 'd think they might disperse or run away , frightened of being arrested , but it 's not happening , is it .
tim : it shows how brazen they are .
it shows how brazen they are .
the lack of respect for the police , the lack of respect for the general public seems to be reaching epidemic proportions , and it is very frightening to observe .
vine : i must say it does feel rather strange going out in a 4x4 with a camera and a former special forces man looking for kids who might get out of control .
it 's all about watching .
the metal pole is hard to miss .
but the ex-soldiers wont put themselves in personal danger .
tim : see the activity with girl on there , lighting and striking the light out , heating up the little block of dope .
vine : this is not a scenario in which you 'd want to intervene alone .
tim : not the kind of behaviour you want .
you see if you live in that house there you do n't want kids running all over your wall ...
vine : we 're just listening to the radio here because ...
-lsb- radio -rsb- ... they 're coming in this direction and back the way they came .
vine : we 're just being told there are three guys coming towards us who 've just been fighting , come from down near the bowling alley and we do n't want them to see us in the car so ...
sometimes it 's verbal abuse , sometimes it 's worse , and even though the men filming used to be in special forces , they do n't try to break anything up .
tim : i would advise extreme caution .
invariably we see people coming out and wanting to get involved but they 're putting themselves at quite a great deal of risk .
you know , if we ? re concerned about getting involved they most certainly should be .
they 're just an average joe from the street and they really do have to be very , very careful .
vine : so one thing is clear here , cracking down on thuggery is not only the job of the police , but once we decide it 's our job too , that can have unforeseen consequences .
one man in kent thought he 'd teach a group of local teenagers a lesson they would n't forget and he found himself on the wrong side of the law .
looking at paul , kim and their daughter megan , you would n't guess what they ? ve been through .
paul 's experience proves a cautionary tale if you 're thinking of being a good samaritan .
they used to live above a corner shop where they were constantly being sworn at and threatened by a group of teenage lads with nobody to turn to for help .
kimberley tucker : i was frightened , i was frightened for megan .
i 've been losing sleep .
obviously went to the doctors .
i just could n't eat .
i was just worrying all the time what 's going to happen , what are they going to do next as they threatened to burn down the house with me and megan inside ...
vine : the couple rang the police again and again and specifically said that the shopkeeper , mr patel , had been racially abused , but the trouble carried on .
the youths even taunted paul 's mum and finally he decided he could ignore it no longer .
but on that night you took action .
paul catlow yes .
well the police had done nothing .
they 'd been called at least twice before .
we 'd been to the school about their behaviour .
so i thought enough was enough and i wanted to make a citizen 's arrest .
vine : you pursued them .
paul : i pursued them just up this road here and had all kinds of abuse thrown back at me .
vine : paul and the shopkeeper jumped into their van and found one of the lads hiding in bushes .
paul : i sort of pulled him out and said : " come on " and he struggled with me and then just basically fell to the floor on my feet .
i pulled him up and said : " look , i ? m not going to hurt you , i just want to ... you know , put an end to all this . "
he said : " okay , do n't call the police , i 'll come and apologise to your parents and everyone involved " and that was that .
so we got in the van ...
vine : so he got into the van of his own free will .
paul : yeah , he got in the van .
vine : he volunteered to get in .
paul : yeah , he volunteered to get in the van .
went down to my mum 's , he apologised to her .
carolyn catlow paul ? s mother he said he was sorry .
mr patel said : " now say you 're sorry as though you mean it " i think he meant , so he said : " i ? m really sorry " and he looked really embarrassed .
but paul then said : " well i ? m glad you 've done that .
that ? s it now , let ? s forget it all . "
vine : but he could n't forget it .
the next day when paul was back at his job in the city , the teenager was telling the police he had been kidnapped .
we ca n't name the youths but they were known troublemakers .
paul 's life froze .
he was arrested and charged with kidnap and assault , he even went to prison .
paul : it 's just really a horrible experience really .
you know , i did n't get a lot of sleep at all .
the food was awful , you know , i lost a lot of weight .
and the thing is that was so frustrating , everyone in there said ... you know , they heard my story and they all say ... you know : " we all say we should n't be in here but you really should n't be here . "
and even the gaolers actually told me that as well , you know : " what ?
this is a joke !
what are you doing here ?
it 's appalling . "
vine : paul was bailed after a week , but the louts were waiting with more and more abuse which kim recorded in pages of notes .
the couple rang the police more than 40 times with no result .
after 14 months paul arrived in court .
one of the kids did n't even bother to turn up and the case collapsed .
carolyn : i think the youths have won because they 've got away with it .
they 've just not been punished and they 're out there to do it again and they probably will .
-lsb- vox pops on street -rsb- young woman : but that 's today 's society , is n't it ?
you ca n't do right for doing wrong really , or you ca n't do ... you know , so ...
vine : yeah , so you 're worried you get involved you might get on the wrong end of the law .
girl : yeah , i mean ... well it 's just ... and there 's so many loopholes to everything , you know .
what can and ca n't you do as ... you know , a citizen of society , you know , you just do n't know really .
vine : do you fear that in a situation where you got involved and you went in physically to stop something , do you worry the police might turn up and arrest you ?
man : yes , definitely .
vine : why do you worry about that ?
man : because that 's what happens , is n't it ?
if you 're under 16 and your first claim is to say : " i was hit , i was doing nothing , he 's an adult .. "
rah di rah di rah ... and you read about it all the time .
vine : we asked to interview the police officers involved in paul catlow 's case , but they said no .
the met told us they did n't comment on criminal justice matters .
when you hear that story , minister , you must think : " why do bother ? "
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security well not quite , i do feel that sometimes when i read newspapers , but whatever the provocation , however much someone has irritated or annoyed , i have to take it back in some circumstances , again through frustration or whatever else , and violently seeking to get redress ...
vine : he did n't use violence ... he came in his van to apologise .
i mean this poor guy , he 's had 18 months knocked out of his life .
mcnulty : ah but if you turn round ...
i do n't want to dwell on the specific case , but most people with commonsense would say that that needs at least a cursory investigation .
now i know in this particular case it was longer , but people would i think be ... look awry at the police if they did n't at least look into the circumstances and context of that .
vine : but come on , it 's just commonsense , this is .
you know , the idea the police turn up and have to investigate the law-abiding citizen who took action it 's just pc plod is n't it ?
surely they can see the situation .
mcnulty : more often than not in these cases commonsense has prevailed once the context has been fully understood .
vine : it just seems to be easier for the police to arrest the law-abiding citizen and get him into court because they know he 'll turn up .
mcnulty : i understand that , i understand people 's frustration too .
but things must be done through the appropriate channels .
paul : actually no , because they 're under 18 they 're untouchable and the police have admitted that to me as well .
one police community officer actually said the boy involved needed a good kicking , and i actually turned round and said to her : " this is a new safer neighbourhood scheme ... is this what you call a safer neighbourhood , encouraging people to go out and kick them in ? "
i said : " i have n't even done that and look how i 've ended up .
so could you imagine if i did do that and take your advice , what would happen ? "
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : do you regret being a good samaritan ?
paul : no , i think if everyone sort of ... you know , sat back and let these kids get on with it because of the way the law stands , i think we 'd be heading for quite a disaster .
i think it needs people to stand up to these yobs and go out there and take action .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- pauline cowan tom noble 's partner if we ignore things and just let them get away with it , we are turning to be as bad as what they are and it 's not a society that you want to live in .
you want it to be a better society so you 've got to go out and help each other because if you do n't these yobs are definitely going to win , they 're going to take over .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : well that 's all for this week , but don ? t forget you can join the argument on my radio 2 show at midday each day and also please do email us here at panorama if there ? s anything you want us to investigate .

panorama should i fight back ?
recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 5:02:07 jeremy vine : good evening .
i 'm jeremy vine and this is panorama .
two robbers with knives attack an elderly newsagent .
he instinctively fights back .
is he a hero or just plain foolish ?
put yourself in this man 's shoes , he went to the aid of two teenagers being attacked by a gang .
do you join in or walk on by ?
you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman .
what do you do ?
do you retreat and ring the police ?
it 's a split second decision that any of us could face at any time , whether to intervene or turn away .
it 's happened to me , maybe it 's happened to you .
tonight we 're asking if we do n't take action when we see crime and antisocial behaviour happening right in front of our eyes , who will ?
i 've been meeting people who have fought back against criminals with vastly different consequences , but as individuals just what is the right thing to do when we are confronted by violence or antisocial behaviour ?
stoke on trent here an armed robber runs into a busy post office .
robber : oi , put the money in the bag .
put the money in the bag or you get it through the head .
now .
quick !
vine : kym ledgar , the sub-postmistress was terrified .
kym ledgar : i saw this figure all in black , and could n't even see like the whites of his eyes , and he 'd got the shotgun , he 'd pointed it at me and then he moved it to customer and he said , in a very threatening strong voice : robber : put the money in the bag .
manager : give him the money kim .
robber : put the money in the f * * * ing bag .
quick !
kim : so i just got up and did exactly as he said .
vine : her husband , barry , a former soldier , walked straight into the middle of the robbery .
barry : it was an instant decision .
well we came into contact right by the counter here .
he started to turn , i grabbed hold of the barrel of the shotgun and as he turned , with the my other hand i grabbed his collar .
vine : barry , in beige , grabbed the robber who 's wearing a hood .
kim : i remember giving out a blood-curdling scream because i thought i could well lose him .
barry : he was pulling away , i was pushing .
it was a struggle for the gun , control of the gun .
kim : i knew barry would n't let go .
i just knew how determined he would be .
i was just in fear of his life .
barry : and we bounced off one or two of the walls and then he threatened to kill me , all part and parcel of it .
then he let go of the gun and leapt up and he was out through the door .
vine : barry , who has a serious heart condition , cracked a rib in the vicious struggle .
kim : i thought i might have lost him actually .
he 'd gone an ashen colour and his lips had gone purple , and i was very , very concerned that he was going to have a heart attack .
vine : the robber was sasha markovic , a heroin addict and persistent offender .
barry was awarded a bravery medal by the police but confusingly they tell others not to follow his example .
chief inspector paul clews staffordshire police we generally advise in such a serious incident like that people should n't get involved , but i 'd certainly not be critical of barry for his bravery .
vine : for barry it 's not really about bravery , he feels he simply ca n't look on while the family post office is targeted by robbers .
four times its happened in 15 years .
so next time ?
barry : if i was confronted by a criminal in similar circumstances i would hope i would do the same .
it depends on the situation .
it 's not something you can give a general advice to .
if you can avoid it , then by all means if you think it 's dangerous , do n't do it .
phone the police and let the police handle it , they 're trained for it .
vine : just 34 % of us would stop teenagers vandalising a bus shelter compared to 65 % of germans and 52 % of spaniards .
armed with some disturbing cctv footage i decided to do my own research with the public .
-lsb- vox pops on the street -rsb- man : i 'd have thought if he 's got a weapon , get out .
vine : yeah ?
man : mmm .
man 2 : if ever i saw that , probably i do n't fight back , no , i 'd run .
vine : the knife ?
man 2 : a knife .
i might fight back .
woman : i do n't know if i 'd physically walk over to them .
i mean i might scream out and say : " what are you doing ? "
i definitely would phone the police .
sunderland vine : but you ca n't always be sure the police will get there in time , and if you 're on an estate like this one and there are gangs involved and it 's just you , the stakes can be very high .
in the end , for lots of people , stepping forward is a snap judgement , it 's instantaneous and , for some , it 's disastrous .
-lsb- home video -rsb- tom : this is the first of january 1902 .
child : 2004 !
tom : 2004 , alright , i stand corrected .
vine : a happy family scene , but tom noble 's children don ? t have a father anymore .
he was a builder and a fit man , and a year after this was filmed he thought he could help a young girl who was being attacked by teenagers in his street .
geoff bird tom 's friend tom walked straight in amongst all of them and asked what was going on and one lad said : " and what are you going to do about it ? " sort of thing , he was the tallest lad of the group .
and i mean tom was ex-army and he was n't sort of phased by anybody , certainly nobody like that , and he squared up to the lad and said ... you know : " i ? m out here to sort it out " and the lad turned and ran away .
tom turned to face myself and as he walked back towards me , the lad ran up behind him and punched him in the back of the neck .
i saw the look in his eye , he was looking directly at me when the blow hit him in the neck and he died before he hit the ground .
so ... that 's it .
vine : as paramedics fought to save him , pauline , tom 's partner of 12 years , watched .
but the punch had severed an artery in his neck .
pauline cowan they gave like an injection and then i saw the machine go ... the machine went ' beep ' like that and then it went flat then , and that 's when i sort of got quite a shock .
i sort of went : " oh no " and they said " no " and kept on working on him .
vine : fifty-two year old tom was rushed to hospital .
two days later they switched off his life support .
geoff : tom was my best friend .
there was nobody else could come close to that .
it was just a terrible loss .
vine : the killer was 16 , a schoolboy , gary prescott .
he was already on an asbo for criminal damage and drunkenness .
in fact it 's thought the police had stopped him one hour before the attack , but they did n't take him in .
now they 've charged him with manslaughter and pauline was determined to face him in court .
pauline : and i just had to stare at him and stare at him because i just felt ... you know , i want you to look at me and see what ... you 've robbed me of my life .
you took tom 's life but you 've also took my life away .
vine : and here there is a cruel lesson for good samaritans .
tom 's attacker got three years in prison .
no , make that 18 months after an early release .
geoff : it was typical of tom , it was typical of any of us , myself , my wife , we would have all done the same thing .
it just happened that tom was the first one there .
but yeah , he would have helped anybody .
vine : what about the killer ?
his family did n't want to be shown , but we spoke to them .
prescott 's father says he 's sorry tom died but it 's his own fault because he chose to have a go .
prescott snr : a grown man , he were n't a teenager .
what 's he going to be thinking ?
it 's either you 're gonna get hit or he 's gonna get it , but there was no malice in it .
vine : no malice !
prescott ? s grandmother , sylvia hope , is sorry but says she would have done the same as her grandson .
sylvia hope : if anybody was coming at me i would have done the same .
i 'm sorry , but anybody who was coming at me , and i thought somebody was going to throw a punch at me , well i would go forward first .
vine : tom was killed for trying to do the right thing , so pauline has been thinking it through .
was it right when the cost of taking action was so high ?
it 's now nearly two years since tom died and she 's come to maybe a surprising conclusion .
pauline : i 'm pleased tom did what he did .
obviously the consequences were awful , but i still think that i would do it myself if i saw someone getting hurt i would go out and do something , and i think people should , you know , i mean i don ? t want people to go out and obviously lose their lives and things like that , but if some innocent person is getting hurt people 's got to help them .
-lsb- street vox pops -rsb- vine : what do you do ?
man : it 's a tough decision , is n't it ?
it depends on how many people are about , whether you 're ... yeah , if you can handle yourself and you think you can take control of the situation , yeah , i think you do .
woman : i usually do intervene .
vine : what do you do ?
woman : well i usually say : " i think you 're being silly " you know " why don ? t you just go home ? " or something like that .
man 2 : i have done in the past and it ended up with ...
i don ? t know if you can see it .
vine : let 's have a look .
oh yeah , you 've got a scar there .
man 2 : yeah , i 've got a scar , i 've got another one here where i intervened in a pub .
a friend of mine , he lost his leg through it .
vine : and what happened there , a pub fight was it ?
man 2 : we were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
vine : the government 's big idea is for us all to be doing something before the trouble starts where we live .
that 's their ' respect ' agenda .
' give respect , get respect ' is the slogan .
it 's all about tackling antisocial behaviour before it 's taken root .
now picture that .
in fact you do n't have to picture it , we can show you it .
birmingham -lsb- video footage -rsb- linda and michelle , mary and sheila , they probably would n't want to be called the b team but they are in birmingham .
there 's strength in numbers and the women had all joined together to fight back against antisocial behaviour without having to risk going it alone .
linda : can you go over there now because there 's been some problem with fly-tipping over there .
wagons roll .
have you got your torches guys ?
there 's a television been dumped .
we 'll get it moved tomorrow .
mary : why oh why do people do it ?
people keep dumping things .
linda : i know .
let 's start leafleting guys , now .
vine : a few years ago being out after dark on the perry common estate would not be recommended .
thugs ruled .
decent residents lived in terror .
mary : i was more angry than frightened .
there was n't a night went by when we did n't have one of our windows put through .
but rather scary been sitting in your armchair and having glass all of a sudden come over you .
i was very , very angry .
michelle ashmore perry common community watch it became a no go zone and there was rat runs and we were having speeding cars and smashing them up on the ... like straight into the trees , and then you 'd got a car ... a wrecked car on the public open spaces and things , so i think the fear of crime rose quite a lot and people would n't walk the streets after sort of 6 o 'clock at night .
vine : and what these women had done by getting involved is right up the government 's street .
last year mr blair launched his respect agenda with a splash , it 's to empower us ordinary citizens to tackle antisocial behaviour ourselves and not just leave it to the police and other authorities .
tony blair : what 's important obviously is to give the local communities the powers that they need to crack down on antisocial behaviour .
vine : it 's easy to laugh at a neighbourhood watch scheme on wheels but here burglaries have dropped by 42 % in three years and car crime by nearly 30 % .
and our active citizens are toasted .
they go to conferences .
on stage here in bristol the government 's so-called respect tzar louise casey tells them what they already know .
lousie casey : the public are the most important ... the most important , the most crucial , and indeed , if i dare say it , the sometimes forgotten weapon in the battle against antisocial behaviour .
vine : as night falls , off they go again .
this is not once a month , or weekends only , it 's a way of life .
linda : what you doing ?
you 're doing ... just walking about ?
kids : yeah .
linda : have you been to youth club ?
boy : yeah .
linda : have you ?
boy : yeah .
linda : do you like it there or not ?
boy : it 's alright .
boy 2 : it 's good .
linda : is it ?
oh grand .
boy : we have responsibilities and everything in the club and we 're looking after other people .
linda : you 're looking after the streets , are you ?
boys : yeah .
linda : ... and checking in ... checking to see if people are having problems ?
sheila barker perry common community watch we do n't challenge .
we 're not have-a-go heroes , we 're just normal people that care about our community .
vine : and the government wants more of us to be as involved as those birmingham women .
in fact a leaked home office initiative centred on the slogan : " don ? t moan , take action , it 's your street too . "
but that caused confusion among people who say : " well how far are we expected to go when we see violent or antisocial behaviour ? "
you see something happening in the street , do you step in ?
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security the general line must be to get in touch with the authorities straightaway and make sure that , if things are as bad as you paint , that the police will be there as quickly as they can .
vine : you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman , what do you do ?
you retreat and ring the police ?
mcnulty : i think you should in the first instance , it may well be that simply shouting at them , blowing your horn or whatever else deters them and they go away .
vine : he 's now hitting her and the police have n't come .
what do you do then ?
mcnulty : the same ... the same .
vine : you still wait ?
mcnulty : you must get back to the police , try some distractive activities , whatever else .
vine : what , jump up and down ?
mcnulty : but i would say ... well sometimes that may well work .
vine : i 'm confused here because we 're told that your line on this is that people should stop moaning and tackle antisocial behaviour themselves : " it 's your street too . "
mcnulty : but " do n't moan , take action " is about wider communities fully embracing the respect agenda , fully embracing all the elements at their disposal through antisocial behaviour legislation and taking action through those official , formal channels .
vine : well listening to that you have to hope that if you 're ever attacked in the street it 's not the home office minister who happens to be passing , and the whole idea of ringing the police is problematic when the police seem to be overrun in so many areas .
so take carlisle for example , there the housing association has had to enlist what is effectively a private army to help the tenants and deal with the yobs , and i went to see them in action .
young criminals setting fire to front doors right beside some houses .
imagine living next to this , but you certainly would not want to tackle this lot on your own .
what the teenagers didn ? t know was that ex-sas men were filming their activities .
-lsb- filming : night time , hooded youths feeding blaze -rsb- steve harrison carlisle housing association it 's difficult to get evidence when we 're investigating antisocial behaviour where the residents and the victims are feeling intimidated and they do n't want to come forward for fear of repercussions and we thought if we can send them out and go out and gather the evidence from the streets , that would be enough for us to be able to take to court and prove to the court that the nuisance is actually taking place .
tim the surveillance group we have kind of a lot of different types of covert cameras like vision lenses , long-range lenses , not your average hand-held video cameras .
vine : tim 's surveillance group is employed by councils all over the uk , and sometimes even by the police who have n't got time to stake out estates like his ex-soldiers .
tim : a lot of them say they 're just as likely to get injured on the streets of a kind of major uk conurbation as they were in afghanistan or iraq .
the difference is this time it 's a 14 year old or a group of 14 year olds who may or may not happen to be carrying a knife .
steve : it does seem a bit extreme but you have to put yourself in the position of the victims who are suffering day in and day out nuisance , antisocial behaviour , intimidation , threats , noise nuisance , that type of thing , and to live with that every day ... and it can bring an estate down .
vine : and they know if they watch the right people , eventually they will do the wrong thing .
-lsb- filming : youths break into parked vehicle and driving it away -rsb- vine : who are these guys ?
tim : this is a group of youths who have recently turned up in a stolen vehicle .
these two were the ones which have just driven it onto ... into the centre of the park with the lights off .
vine : and there 's something going on here , there 's three young lads and there 's two or three girls , i do n't know what they 're doing actually , i 'm just trying to see .
tim : i think they 're just moving up to enjoy the spectacle .
vine : oh there 's the car , and the group of youths who we 've seen walking along the bank have just walked down to the car , probably opened the petrol cap and just torched it .
they have , however , stripped it of its alloy wheels and very shortly we see them walking back with all of those alloys .
you 'd think they might disperse or run away , frightened of being arrested , but it 's not happening , is it .
tim : it shows how brazen they are .
it shows how brazen they are .
the lack of respect for the police , the lack of respect for the general public seems to be reaching epidemic proportions , and it is very frightening to observe .
vine : i must say it does feel rather strange going out in a 4x4 with a camera and a former special forces man looking for kids who might get out of control .
it 's all about watching .
the metal pole is hard to miss .
but the ex-soldiers wont put themselves in personal danger .
tim : see the activity with girl on there , lighting and striking the light out , heating up the little block of dope .
vine : this is not a scenario in which you 'd want to intervene alone .
tim : not the kind of behaviour you want .
you see if you live in that house there you do n't want kids running all over your wall ...
vine : we 're just listening to the radio here because ...
-lsb- radio -rsb- ... they 're coming in this direction and back the way they came .
vine : we 're just being told there are three guys coming towards us who 've just been fighting , come from down near the bowling alley and we do n't want them to see us in the car so ...
sometimes it 's verbal abuse , sometimes it 's worse , and even though the men filming used to be in special forces , they do n't try to break anything up .
tim : i would advise extreme caution .
invariably we see people coming out and wanting to get involved but they 're putting themselves at quite a great deal of risk .
you know , if we ? re concerned about getting involved they most certainly should be .
they 're just an average joe from the street and they really do have to be very , very careful .
vine : so one thing is clear here , cracking down on thuggery is not only the job of the police , but once we decide it 's our job too , that can have unforeseen consequences .
one man in kent thought he 'd teach a group of local teenagers a lesson they would n't forget and he found himself on the wrong side of the law .
looking at paul , kim and their daughter megan , you would n't guess what they ? ve been through .
paul 's experience proves a cautionary tale if you 're thinking of being a good samaritan .
they used to live above a corner shop where they were constantly being sworn at and threatened by a group of teenage lads with nobody to turn to for help .
kimberley tucker : i was frightened , i was frightened for megan .
i 've been losing sleep .
obviously went to the doctors .
i just could n't eat .
i was just worrying all the time what 's going to happen , what are they going to do next as they threatened to burn down the house with me and megan inside ...
vine : the couple rang the police again and again and specifically said that the shopkeeper , mr patel , had been racially abused , but the trouble carried on .
the youths even taunted paul 's mum and finally he decided he could ignore it no longer .
but on that night you took action .
paul catlow yes .
well the police had done nothing .
they 'd been called at least twice before .
we 'd been to the school about their behaviour .
so i thought enough was enough and i wanted to make a citizen 's arrest .
vine : you pursued them .
paul : i pursued them just up this road here and had all kinds of abuse thrown back at me .
vine : paul and the shopkeeper jumped into their van and found one of the lads hiding in bushes .
paul : i sort of pulled him out and said : " come on " and he struggled with me and then just basically fell to the floor on my feet .
i pulled him up and said : " look , i ? m not going to hurt you , i just want to ... you know , put an end to all this . "
he said : " okay , do n't call the police , i 'll come and apologise to your parents and everyone involved " and that was that .
so we got in the van ...
vine : so he got into the van of his own free will .
paul : yeah , he got in the van .
vine : he volunteered to get in .
paul : yeah , he volunteered to get in the van .
went down to my mum 's , he apologised to her .
carolyn catlow paul ? s mother he said he was sorry .
mr patel said : " now say you 're sorry as though you mean it " i think he meant , so he said : " i ? m really sorry " and he looked really embarrassed .
but paul then said : " well i ? m glad you 've done that .
that ? s it now , let ? s forget it all . "
vine : but he could n't forget it .
the next day when paul was back at his job in the city , the teenager was telling the police he had been kidnapped .
we ca n't name the youths but they were known troublemakers .
paul 's life froze .
he was arrested and charged with kidnap and assault , he even went to prison .
paul : it 's just really a horrible experience really .
you know , i did n't get a lot of sleep at all .
the food was awful , you know , i lost a lot of weight .
and the thing is that was so frustrating , everyone in there said ... you know , they heard my story and they all say ... you know : " we all say we should n't be in here but you really should n't be here . "
and even the gaolers actually told me that as well , you know : " what ?
this is a joke !
what are you doing here ?
it 's appalling . "
vine : paul was bailed after a week , but the louts were waiting with more and more abuse which kim recorded in pages of notes .
the couple rang the police more than 40 times with no result .
after 14 months paul arrived in court .
one of the kids did n't even bother to turn up and the case collapsed .
carolyn : i think the youths have won because they 've got away with it .
they 've just not been punished and they 're out there to do it again and they probably will .
-lsb- vox pops on street -rsb- young woman : but that 's today 's society , is n't it ?
you ca n't do right for doing wrong really , or you ca n't do ... you know , so ...
vine : yeah , so you 're worried you get involved you might get on the wrong end of the law .
girl : yeah , i mean ... well it 's just ... and there 's so many loopholes to everything , you know .
what can and ca n't you do as ... you know , a citizen of society , you know , you just do n't know really .
vine : do you fear that in a situation where you got involved and you went in physically to stop something , do you worry the police might turn up and arrest you ?
man : yes , definitely .
vine : why do you worry about that ?
man : because that 's what happens , is n't it ?
if you 're under 16 and your first claim is to say : " i was hit , i was doing nothing , he 's an adult .. "
rah di rah di rah ... and you read about it all the time .
vine : we asked to interview the police officers involved in paul catlow 's case , but they said no .
the met told us they did n't comment on criminal justice matters .
when you hear that story , minister , you must think : " why do bother ? "
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security well not quite , i do feel that sometimes when i read newspapers , but whatever the provocation , however much someone has irritated or annoyed , i have to take it back in some circumstances , again through frustration or whatever else , and violently seeking to get redress ...
vine : he did n't use violence ... he came in his van to apologise .
i mean this poor guy , he 's had 18 months knocked out of his life .
mcnulty : ah but if you turn round ...
i do n't want to dwell on the specific case , but most people with commonsense would say that that needs at least a cursory investigation .
now i know in this particular case it was longer , but people would i think be ... look awry at the police if they did n't at least look into the circumstances and context of that .
vine : but come on , it 's just commonsense , this is .
you know , the idea the police turn up and have to investigate the law-abiding citizen who took action it 's just pc plod is n't it ?
surely they can see the situation .
mcnulty : more often than not in these cases commonsense has prevailed once the context has been fully understood .
vine : it just seems to be easier for the police to arrest the law-abiding citizen and get him into court because they know he 'll turn up .
mcnulty : i understand that , i understand people 's frustration too .
but things must be done through the appropriate channels .
paul : actually no , because they 're under 18 they 're untouchable and the police have admitted that to me as well .
one police community officer actually said the boy involved needed a good kicking , and i actually turned round and said to her : " this is a new safer neighbourhood scheme ... is this what you call a safer neighbourhood , encouraging people to go out and kick them in ? "
i said : " i have n't even done that and look how i 've ended up .
so could you imagine if i did do that and take your advice , what would happen ? "
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : do you regret being a good samaritan ?
paul : no , i think if everyone sort of ... you know , sat back and let these kids get on with it because of the way the law stands , i think we 'd be heading for quite a disaster .
i think it needs people to stand up to these yobs and go out there and take action .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- pauline cowan tom noble 's partner if we ignore things and just let them get away with it , we are turning to be as bad as what they are and it 's not a society that you want to live in .
you want it to be a better society so you 've got to go out and help each other because if you do n't these yobs are definitely going to win , they 're going to take over .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : well that 's all for this week , but don ? t forget you can join the argument on my radio 2 show at midday each day and also please do email us here at panorama if there ? s anything you want us to investigate .

panorama should i fight back ?
recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 5:02:07 jeremy vine : good evening .
i 'm jeremy vine and this is panorama .
two robbers with knives attack an elderly newsagent .
he instinctively fights back .
is he a hero or just plain foolish ?
put yourself in this man 's shoes , he went to the aid of two teenagers being attacked by a gang .
do you join in or walk on by ?
you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman .
what do you do ?
do you retreat and ring the police ?
it 's a split second decision that any of us could face at any time , whether to intervene or turn away .
it 's happened to me , maybe it 's happened to you .
tonight we 're asking if we do n't take action when we see crime and antisocial behaviour happening right in front of our eyes , who will ?
i 've been meeting people who have fought back against criminals with vastly different consequences , but as individuals just what is the right thing to do when we are confronted by violence or antisocial behaviour ?
stoke on trent here an armed robber runs into a busy post office .
robber : oi , put the money in the bag .
put the money in the bag or you get it through the head .
now .
quick !
vine : kym ledgar , the sub-postmistress was terrified .
kym ledgar : i saw this figure all in black , and could n't even see like the whites of his eyes , and he 'd got the shotgun , he 'd pointed it at me and then he moved it to customer and he said , in a very threatening strong voice : robber : put the money in the bag .
manager : give him the money kim .
robber : put the money in the f * * * ing bag .
quick !
kim : so i just got up and did exactly as he said .
vine : her husband , barry , a former soldier , walked straight into the middle of the robbery .
barry : it was an instant decision .
well we came into contact right by the counter here .
he started to turn , i grabbed hold of the barrel of the shotgun and as he turned , with the my other hand i grabbed his collar .
vine : barry , in beige , grabbed the robber who 's wearing a hood .
kim : i remember giving out a blood-curdling scream because i thought i could well lose him .
barry : he was pulling away , i was pushing .
it was a struggle for the gun , control of the gun .
kim : i knew barry would n't let go .
i just knew how determined he would be .
i was just in fear of his life .
barry : and we bounced off one or two of the walls and then he threatened to kill me , all part and parcel of it .
then he let go of the gun and leapt up and he was out through the door .
vine : barry , who has a serious heart condition , cracked a rib in the vicious struggle .
kim : i thought i might have lost him actually .
he 'd gone an ashen colour and his lips had gone purple , and i was very , very concerned that he was going to have a heart attack .
vine : the robber was sasha markovic , a heroin addict and persistent offender .
barry was awarded a bravery medal by the police but confusingly they tell others not to follow his example .
chief inspector paul clews staffordshire police we generally advise in such a serious incident like that people should n't get involved , but i 'd certainly not be critical of barry for his bravery .
vine : for barry it 's not really about bravery , he feels he simply ca n't look on while the family post office is targeted by robbers .
four times its happened in 15 years .
so next time ?
barry : if i was confronted by a criminal in similar circumstances i would hope i would do the same .
it depends on the situation .
it 's not something you can give a general advice to .
if you can avoid it , then by all means if you think it 's dangerous , do n't do it .
phone the police and let the police handle it , they 're trained for it .
vine : just 34 % of us would stop teenagers vandalising a bus shelter compared to 65 % of germans and 52 % of spaniards .
armed with some disturbing cctv footage i decided to do my own research with the public .
-lsb- vox pops on the street -rsb- man : i 'd have thought if he 's got a weapon , get out .
vine : yeah ?
man : mmm .
man 2 : if ever i saw that , probably i do n't fight back , no , i 'd run .
vine : the knife ?
man 2 : a knife .
i might fight back .
woman : i do n't know if i 'd physically walk over to them .
i mean i might scream out and say : " what are you doing ? "
i definitely would phone the police .
sunderland vine : but you ca n't always be sure the police will get there in time , and if you 're on an estate like this one and there are gangs involved and it 's just you , the stakes can be very high .
in the end , for lots of people , stepping forward is a snap judgement , it 's instantaneous and , for some , it 's disastrous .
-lsb- home video -rsb- tom : this is the first of january 1902 .
child : 2004 !
tom : 2004 , alright , i stand corrected .
vine : a happy family scene , but tom noble 's children don ? t have a father anymore .
he was a builder and a fit man , and a year after this was filmed he thought he could help a young girl who was being attacked by teenagers in his street .
geoff bird tom 's friend tom walked straight in amongst all of them and asked what was going on and one lad said : " and what are you going to do about it ? " sort of thing , he was the tallest lad of the group .
and i mean tom was ex-army and he was n't sort of phased by anybody , certainly nobody like that , and he squared up to the lad and said ... you know : " i ? m out here to sort it out " and the lad turned and ran away .
tom turned to face myself and as he walked back towards me , the lad ran up behind him and punched him in the back of the neck .
i saw the look in his eye , he was looking directly at me when the blow hit him in the neck and he died before he hit the ground .
so ... that 's it .
vine : as paramedics fought to save him , pauline , tom 's partner of 12 years , watched .
but the punch had severed an artery in his neck .
pauline cowan they gave like an injection and then i saw the machine go ... the machine went ' beep ' like that and then it went flat then , and that 's when i sort of got quite a shock .
i sort of went : " oh no " and they said " no " and kept on working on him .
vine : fifty-two year old tom was rushed to hospital .
two days later they switched off his life support .
geoff : tom was my best friend .
there was nobody else could come close to that .
it was just a terrible loss .
vine : the killer was 16 , a schoolboy , gary prescott .
he was already on an asbo for criminal damage and drunkenness .
in fact it 's thought the police had stopped him one hour before the attack , but they did n't take him in .
now they 've charged him with manslaughter and pauline was determined to face him in court .
pauline : and i just had to stare at him and stare at him because i just felt ... you know , i want you to look at me and see what ... you 've robbed me of my life .
you took tom 's life but you 've also took my life away .
vine : and here there is a cruel lesson for good samaritans .
tom 's attacker got three years in prison .
no , make that 18 months after an early release .
geoff : it was typical of tom , it was typical of any of us , myself , my wife , we would have all done the same thing .
it just happened that tom was the first one there .
but yeah , he would have helped anybody .
vine : what about the killer ?
his family did n't want to be shown , but we spoke to them .
prescott 's father says he 's sorry tom died but it 's his own fault because he chose to have a go .
prescott snr : a grown man , he were n't a teenager .
what 's he going to be thinking ?
it 's either you 're gonna get hit or he 's gonna get it , but there was no malice in it .
vine : no malice !
prescott ? s grandmother , sylvia hope , is sorry but says she would have done the same as her grandson .
sylvia hope : if anybody was coming at me i would have done the same .
i 'm sorry , but anybody who was coming at me , and i thought somebody was going to throw a punch at me , well i would go forward first .
vine : tom was killed for trying to do the right thing , so pauline has been thinking it through .
was it right when the cost of taking action was so high ?
it 's now nearly two years since tom died and she 's come to maybe a surprising conclusion .
pauline : i 'm pleased tom did what he did .
obviously the consequences were awful , but i still think that i would do it myself if i saw someone getting hurt i would go out and do something , and i think people should , you know , i mean i don ? t want people to go out and obviously lose their lives and things like that , but if some innocent person is getting hurt people 's got to help them .
-lsb- street vox pops -rsb- vine : what do you do ?
man : it 's a tough decision , is n't it ?
it depends on how many people are about , whether you 're ... yeah , if you can handle yourself and you think you can take control of the situation , yeah , i think you do .
woman : i usually do intervene .
vine : what do you do ?
woman : well i usually say : " i think you 're being silly " you know " why don ? t you just go home ? " or something like that .
man 2 : i have done in the past and it ended up with ...
i don ? t know if you can see it .
vine : let 's have a look .
oh yeah , you 've got a scar there .
man 2 : yeah , i 've got a scar , i 've got another one here where i intervened in a pub .
a friend of mine , he lost his leg through it .
vine : and what happened there , a pub fight was it ?
man 2 : we were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
vine : the government 's big idea is for us all to be doing something before the trouble starts where we live .
that 's their ' respect ' agenda .
' give respect , get respect ' is the slogan .
it 's all about tackling antisocial behaviour before it 's taken root .
now picture that .
in fact you do n't have to picture it , we can show you it .
birmingham -lsb- video footage -rsb- linda and michelle , mary and sheila , they probably would n't want to be called the b team but they are in birmingham .
there 's strength in numbers and the women had all joined together to fight back against antisocial behaviour without having to risk going it alone .
linda : can you go over there now because there 's been some problem with fly-tipping over there .
wagons roll .
have you got your torches guys ?
there 's a television been dumped .
we 'll get it moved tomorrow .
mary : why oh why do people do it ?
people keep dumping things .
linda : i know .
let 's start leafleting guys , now .
vine : a few years ago being out after dark on the perry common estate would not be recommended .
thugs ruled .
decent residents lived in terror .
mary : i was more angry than frightened .
there was n't a night went by when we did n't have one of our windows put through .
but rather scary been sitting in your armchair and having glass all of a sudden come over you .
i was very , very angry .
michelle ashmore perry common community watch it became a no go zone and there was rat runs and we were having speeding cars and smashing them up on the ... like straight into the trees , and then you 'd got a car ... a wrecked car on the public open spaces and things , so i think the fear of crime rose quite a lot and people would n't walk the streets after sort of 6 o 'clock at night .
vine : and what these women had done by getting involved is right up the government 's street .
last year mr blair launched his respect agenda with a splash , it 's to empower us ordinary citizens to tackle antisocial behaviour ourselves and not just leave it to the police and other authorities .
tony blair : what 's important obviously is to give the local communities the powers that they need to crack down on antisocial behaviour .
vine : it 's easy to laugh at a neighbourhood watch scheme on wheels but here burglaries have dropped by 42 % in three years and car crime by nearly 30 % .
and our active citizens are toasted .
they go to conferences .
on stage here in bristol the government 's so-called respect tzar louise casey tells them what they already know .
lousie casey : the public are the most important ... the most important , the most crucial , and indeed , if i dare say it , the sometimes forgotten weapon in the battle against antisocial behaviour .
vine : as night falls , off they go again .
this is not once a month , or weekends only , it 's a way of life .
linda : what you doing ?
you 're doing ... just walking about ?
kids : yeah .
linda : have you been to youth club ?
boy : yeah .
linda : have you ?
boy : yeah .
linda : do you like it there or not ?
boy : it 's alright .
boy 2 : it 's good .
linda : is it ?
oh grand .
boy : we have responsibilities and everything in the club and we 're looking after other people .
linda : you 're looking after the streets , are you ?
boys : yeah .
linda : ... and checking in ... checking to see if people are having problems ?
sheila barker perry common community watch we do n't challenge .
we 're not have-a-go heroes , we 're just normal people that care about our community .
vine : and the government wants more of us to be as involved as those birmingham women .
in fact a leaked home office initiative centred on the slogan : " don ? t moan , take action , it 's your street too . "
but that caused confusion among people who say : " well how far are we expected to go when we see violent or antisocial behaviour ? "
you see something happening in the street , do you step in ?
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security the general line must be to get in touch with the authorities straightaway and make sure that , if things are as bad as you paint , that the police will be there as quickly as they can .
vine : you see a young man looking aggressive , shouting at an old woman , what do you do ?
you retreat and ring the police ?
mcnulty : i think you should in the first instance , it may well be that simply shouting at them , blowing your horn or whatever else deters them and they go away .
vine : he 's now hitting her and the police have n't come .
what do you do then ?
mcnulty : the same ... the same .
vine : you still wait ?
mcnulty : you must get back to the police , try some distractive activities , whatever else .
vine : what , jump up and down ?
mcnulty : but i would say ... well sometimes that may well work .
vine : i 'm confused here because we 're told that your line on this is that people should stop moaning and tackle antisocial behaviour themselves : " it 's your street too . "
mcnulty : but " do n't moan , take action " is about wider communities fully embracing the respect agenda , fully embracing all the elements at their disposal through antisocial behaviour legislation and taking action through those official , formal channels .
vine : well listening to that you have to hope that if you 're ever attacked in the street it 's not the home office minister who happens to be passing , and the whole idea of ringing the police is problematic when the police seem to be overrun in so many areas .
so take carlisle for example , there the housing association has had to enlist what is effectively a private army to help the tenants and deal with the yobs , and i went to see them in action .
young criminals setting fire to front doors right beside some houses .
imagine living next to this , but you certainly would not want to tackle this lot on your own .
what the teenagers didn ? t know was that ex-sas men were filming their activities .
-lsb- filming : night time , hooded youths feeding blaze -rsb- steve harrison carlisle housing association it 's difficult to get evidence when we 're investigating antisocial behaviour where the residents and the victims are feeling intimidated and they do n't want to come forward for fear of repercussions and we thought if we can send them out and go out and gather the evidence from the streets , that would be enough for us to be able to take to court and prove to the court that the nuisance is actually taking place .
tim the surveillance group we have kind of a lot of different types of covert cameras like vision lenses , long-range lenses , not your average hand-held video cameras .
vine : tim 's surveillance group is employed by councils all over the uk , and sometimes even by the police who have n't got time to stake out estates like his ex-soldiers .
tim : a lot of them say they 're just as likely to get injured on the streets of a kind of major uk conurbation as they were in afghanistan or iraq .
the difference is this time it 's a 14 year old or a group of 14 year olds who may or may not happen to be carrying a knife .
steve : it does seem a bit extreme but you have to put yourself in the position of the victims who are suffering day in and day out nuisance , antisocial behaviour , intimidation , threats , noise nuisance , that type of thing , and to live with that every day ... and it can bring an estate down .
vine : and they know if they watch the right people , eventually they will do the wrong thing .
-lsb- filming : youths break into parked vehicle and driving it away -rsb- vine : who are these guys ?
tim : this is a group of youths who have recently turned up in a stolen vehicle .
these two were the ones which have just driven it onto ... into the centre of the park with the lights off .
vine : and there 's something going on here , there 's three young lads and there 's two or three girls , i do n't know what they 're doing actually , i 'm just trying to see .
tim : i think they 're just moving up to enjoy the spectacle .
vine : oh there 's the car , and the group of youths who we 've seen walking along the bank have just walked down to the car , probably opened the petrol cap and just torched it .
they have , however , stripped it of its alloy wheels and very shortly we see them walking back with all of those alloys .
you 'd think they might disperse or run away , frightened of being arrested , but it 's not happening , is it .
tim : it shows how brazen they are .
it shows how brazen they are .
the lack of respect for the police , the lack of respect for the general public seems to be reaching epidemic proportions , and it is very frightening to observe .
vine : i must say it does feel rather strange going out in a 4x4 with a camera and a former special forces man looking for kids who might get out of control .
it 's all about watching .
the metal pole is hard to miss .
but the ex-soldiers wont put themselves in personal danger .
tim : see the activity with girl on there , lighting and striking the light out , heating up the little block of dope .
vine : this is not a scenario in which you 'd want to intervene alone .
tim : not the kind of behaviour you want .
you see if you live in that house there you do n't want kids running all over your wall ...
vine : we 're just listening to the radio here because ...
-lsb- radio -rsb- ... they 're coming in this direction and back the way they came .
vine : we 're just being told there are three guys coming towards us who 've just been fighting , come from down near the bowling alley and we do n't want them to see us in the car so ...
sometimes it 's verbal abuse , sometimes it 's worse , and even though the men filming used to be in special forces , they do n't try to break anything up .
tim : i would advise extreme caution .
invariably we see people coming out and wanting to get involved but they 're putting themselves at quite a great deal of risk .
you know , if we ? re concerned about getting involved they most certainly should be .
they 're just an average joe from the street and they really do have to be very , very careful .
vine : so one thing is clear here , cracking down on thuggery is not only the job of the police , but once we decide it 's our job too , that can have unforeseen consequences .
one man in kent thought he 'd teach a group of local teenagers a lesson they would n't forget and he found himself on the wrong side of the law .
looking at paul , kim and their daughter megan , you would n't guess what they ? ve been through .
paul 's experience proves a cautionary tale if you 're thinking of being a good samaritan .
they used to live above a corner shop where they were constantly being sworn at and threatened by a group of teenage lads with nobody to turn to for help .
kimberley tucker : i was frightened , i was frightened for megan .
i 've been losing sleep .
obviously went to the doctors .
i just could n't eat .
i was just worrying all the time what 's going to happen , what are they going to do next as they threatened to burn down the house with me and megan inside ...
vine : the couple rang the police again and again and specifically said that the shopkeeper , mr patel , had been racially abused , but the trouble carried on .
the youths even taunted paul 's mum and finally he decided he could ignore it no longer .
but on that night you took action .
paul catlow yes .
well the police had done nothing .
they 'd been called at least twice before .
we 'd been to the school about their behaviour .
so i thought enough was enough and i wanted to make a citizen 's arrest .
vine : you pursued them .
paul : i pursued them just up this road here and had all kinds of abuse thrown back at me .
vine : paul and the shopkeeper jumped into their van and found one of the lads hiding in bushes .
paul : i sort of pulled him out and said : " come on " and he struggled with me and then just basically fell to the floor on my feet .
i pulled him up and said : " look , i ? m not going to hurt you , i just want to ... you know , put an end to all this . "
he said : " okay , do n't call the police , i 'll come and apologise to your parents and everyone involved " and that was that .
so we got in the van ...
vine : so he got into the van of his own free will .
paul : yeah , he got in the van .
vine : he volunteered to get in .
paul : yeah , he volunteered to get in the van .
went down to my mum 's , he apologised to her .
carolyn catlow paul ? s mother he said he was sorry .
mr patel said : " now say you 're sorry as though you mean it " i think he meant , so he said : " i ? m really sorry " and he looked really embarrassed .
but paul then said : " well i ? m glad you 've done that .
that ? s it now , let ? s forget it all . "
vine : but he could n't forget it .
the next day when paul was back at his job in the city , the teenager was telling the police he had been kidnapped .
we ca n't name the youths but they were known troublemakers .
paul 's life froze .
he was arrested and charged with kidnap and assault , he even went to prison .
paul : it 's just really a horrible experience really .
you know , i did n't get a lot of sleep at all .
the food was awful , you know , i lost a lot of weight .
and the thing is that was so frustrating , everyone in there said ... you know , they heard my story and they all say ... you know : " we all say we should n't be in here but you really should n't be here . "
and even the gaolers actually told me that as well , you know : " what ?
this is a joke !
what are you doing here ?
it 's appalling . "
vine : paul was bailed after a week , but the louts were waiting with more and more abuse which kim recorded in pages of notes .
the couple rang the police more than 40 times with no result .
after 14 months paul arrived in court .
one of the kids did n't even bother to turn up and the case collapsed .
carolyn : i think the youths have won because they 've got away with it .
they 've just not been punished and they 're out there to do it again and they probably will .
-lsb- vox pops on street -rsb- young woman : but that 's today 's society , is n't it ?
you ca n't do right for doing wrong really , or you ca n't do ... you know , so ...
vine : yeah , so you 're worried you get involved you might get on the wrong end of the law .
girl : yeah , i mean ... well it 's just ... and there 's so many loopholes to everything , you know .
what can and ca n't you do as ... you know , a citizen of society , you know , you just do n't know really .
vine : do you fear that in a situation where you got involved and you went in physically to stop something , do you worry the police might turn up and arrest you ?
man : yes , definitely .
vine : why do you worry about that ?
man : because that 's what happens , is n't it ?
if you 're under 16 and your first claim is to say : " i was hit , i was doing nothing , he 's an adult .. "
rah di rah di rah ... and you read about it all the time .
vine : we asked to interview the police officers involved in paul catlow 's case , but they said no .
the met told us they did n't comment on criminal justice matters .
when you hear that story , minister , you must think : " why do bother ? "
tony mcnulty mp minister for police and security well not quite , i do feel that sometimes when i read newspapers , but whatever the provocation , however much someone has irritated or annoyed , i have to take it back in some circumstances , again through frustration or whatever else , and violently seeking to get redress ...
vine : he did n't use violence ... he came in his van to apologise .
i mean this poor guy , he 's had 18 months knocked out of his life .
mcnulty : ah but if you turn round ...
i do n't want to dwell on the specific case , but most people with commonsense would say that that needs at least a cursory investigation .
now i know in this particular case it was longer , but people would i think be ... look awry at the police if they did n't at least look into the circumstances and context of that .
vine : but come on , it 's just commonsense , this is .
you know , the idea the police turn up and have to investigate the law-abiding citizen who took action it 's just pc plod is n't it ?
surely they can see the situation .
mcnulty : more often than not in these cases commonsense has prevailed once the context has been fully understood .
vine : it just seems to be easier for the police to arrest the law-abiding citizen and get him into court because they know he 'll turn up .
mcnulty : i understand that , i understand people 's frustration too .
but things must be done through the appropriate channels .
paul : actually no , because they 're under 18 they 're untouchable and the police have admitted that to me as well .
one police community officer actually said the boy involved needed a good kicking , and i actually turned round and said to her : " this is a new safer neighbourhood scheme ... is this what you call a safer neighbourhood , encouraging people to go out and kick them in ? "
i said : " i have n't even done that and look how i 've ended up .
so could you imagine if i did do that and take your advice , what would happen ? "
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : do you regret being a good samaritan ?
paul : no , i think if everyone sort of ... you know , sat back and let these kids get on with it because of the way the law stands , i think we 'd be heading for quite a disaster .
i think it needs people to stand up to these yobs and go out there and take action .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- pauline cowan tom noble 's partner if we ignore things and just let them get away with it , we are turning to be as bad as what they are and it 's not a society that you want to live in .
you want it to be a better society so you 've got to go out and help each other because if you do n't these yobs are definitely going to win , they 're going to take over .
-lsb- video footage : hooded robbers in store -rsb- vine : well that 's all for this week , but don ? t forget you can join the argument on my radio 2 show at midday each day and also please do email us here at panorama if there ? s anything you want us to investigate .
we love getting your stories .
thank you , by the way , for all the messages following last week 's programme on seroxat .
many of them were extremely moving .

the decision applies to those who have been living together for two years .
a gay rights group , which had sought the clarification from the court , said at least 100,000 couples would benefit .
a court source said it did not mean same-sex civil unions - which are part of a bill currently being debated in congress - had been approved .
' great step ' the court said the expression " men and women " used in a 1990 law which gives property rights to de-facto couples was unconstitutional .
the head of gay rights group colombia diversa , marcela sanchez , described the ruling as " a great step " .
until now , same-sex couples who wanted to share their property had had to create commercial partnerships to guarantee that in the case of death of one of the partners the shared possessions would go to the surviving one , she said .
" laws are not enough , an important cultural shift is needed ... for discrimination to end , " ms sanchez added .
wednesday 's ruling was condemned by some lay catholic groups , which described it as " going against the family and matrimony " .

all had been supposedly working on the streets to help finance an addiction to heroin and crack cocaine .
their deaths led to calls for heroin to be widely prescribed on the nhs as a way of stopping drug addicts becoming prostitutes .
on a cold night in ipswich 's red light district , janine is working .
she is selling herself in order to buy drugs , specifically heroin and crack cocaine .
it 's the same for all of the other prostitutes she knows .
she says : " i ca n't name one girl who does n't have a drug habit who works the streets . "
" society will have to think about whether they want this treatment to be available and whether they are prepared to pay for it " dr emily finch , maudsley hospital before the killings janine was making almost £ 200 a night .
all of it would be spent on drugs " apart from a phone credit and a packet of fags " .
the heroin also helps her to do the work as , " it just numbs your emotions " .
her friend and fellow heroin user , paula , the mother of a young baby , does n't work as a prostitute but has watched many of her friends end up on the streets .
" i have seen girls do things for crack -lrb- cocaine -rrb- they would never dream of doing otherwise " , she says .
' daily dose ' ten years ago erin o 'mara , who lives in north west london , was in the same position as janine .
to finance her habit she began working in the sex industry , initially as an escort .
as her addiction developed she could n't keep to any routine .
" when you have got a habit the drugs come first and if you do n't have them by the time you start your shift you ca n't do it .
that 's why a lot of girls end up working on the street . "
erin no longer works as a prostitute but she does still take heroin .
after 20 years on the drug she has tried every kind of treatment .
now she is part of a select group of drugs users who get their heroin on the nhs .
at a chemist near her flat there are several other addicts there collecting methadone prescriptions .
methadone is synthetic heroin substitute and is the tried and trusted route for heroin addicts trying to kick the habit .
erin is getting the real thing .
the chemist is expecting her and hands over a bag containing her daily dose of pharmaceutical heroin .
she has been doing this every few days , week in , week out , for the last four years .
she says : " you 've got a measured dose , you know exactly how much you 're taking and you can function perfectly well on it . "
her speech is a little slurred and she seems a little woozy but getting heroin on the nhs has given her stability - she now has a job and a flat .
" i felt like i was trapped on this treatment nightmare .
now that i get my heroin prescribed , all that anxiety has gone . "
control erin is a special case .
she is hiv positive and has had hepatitis c so it 's vital she does n't share needles .
currently just over 1 % of heroin users in the uk , around 400 people , get their heroin in this way .
each one costs the taxpayer around £ 10,000 a year .
in spite of this , some policy makers and police would like to see a lot more people being prescribed heroin .
tom lloyd , the recently retired chief constable of cambridgeshire says heroin on the nhs could dramatically cut the cost of drug relate crime and improve the lives of heroin users .
" if they were allowed to have heroin under controlled circumstances then that chaos would be taken out of their lives , they could get their lives sorted out . "
' huge improvements ' this is exactly what 's currently happening in three areas in britain where trials are being conducted into prescribing heroin on the nhs .
users do n't get it at their local chemist like erin , but have to go to a centre to take the drug under strict supervision .
the trials have only been running for a year but professor john strang , director of the national addiction centre , says the early results are promising .
" our strong clinical impression is we are seeing huge improvements which we would not ordinarily have seen . "
the stiffest opposition to wide scale heroin prescribing comes from professor strang 's own colleagues within the medical establishment .
will suit ' a minority ' at his private gp practice in felixstowe in suffolk , dr john mcmurray has been dispensing methadone to heroin users for many years .
he says giving heroin to patients , even heavily addicted users like erin o 'mara , could end up killing them .
" what you needed to feel perfectly ok yesterday if you use today could be sufficient to kill you " .
even those campaigning for heroin on the nhs say it will only be suitable for a minority of heroin users .
that could still mean up to 25,000 addicts being given free heroin .
the bill for the nhs would be around £ 375m .
dr emily finch is a consultant psychiatrist in addiction at the maudsley hospital , one of the sites conducting trials into heroin prescribing .
she says it wo n't be up to doctors to decide whether the scheme should be rolled out : " society will have to think about whether they want this treatment to be available and whether they are prepared to pay for it . "
the investigation : heroin on the nhs will be broadcast on radio 4 at 2000 gmt on thursday 8 february .

the ipswich deaths raised concerns over links between sex and drugs all had been supposedly working on the streets to help finance an addiction to heroin and crack cocaine .
their deaths led to calls for heroin to be widely prescribed on the nhs as a way of stopping drug addicts becoming prostitutes .
on a cold night in ipswich 's red light district , janine is working .
she is selling herself in order to buy drugs , specifically heroin and crack cocaine .
it 's the same for all of the other prostitutes she knows .
she says : " i ca n't name one girl who does n't have a drug habit who works the streets . "
society will have to think about whether they want this treatment to be available and whether they are prepared to pay for it dr emily finch , maudsley hospital before the killings janine was making almost £ 200 a night .
all of it would be spent on drugs " apart from a phone credit and a packet of fags " .
the heroin also helps her to do the work as , " it just numbs your emotions " .
her friend and fellow heroin user , paula , the mother of a young baby , does n't work as a prostitute but has watched many of her friends end up on the streets .

she has been doing this every few days , week in , week out , for the last four years .
she says : " you 've got a measured dose , you know exactly how much you 're taking and you can function perfectly well on it . "
her speech is a little slurred and she seems a little woozy but getting heroin on the nhs has given her stability - she now has a job and a flat .

this spectacular sporting venue has traditionally played host to the dramas , skills and emotions of the gaelic games , hurling and gaelic football .
now new tenants are about to move in .
it may be little known beyond ireland , apart from among the irish diaspora , but this is one of europe 's finest sporting homes .
with a capacity of 82,000 and state-of-the-art facilities , it is a tribute to the people whose labours have built it , and to the passions and fervour which surround gaelic football and hurling here .
bertie ahern , the irish taoiseach , or prime minister , is a local resident and an avid sports fan .
he 's been coming to " croker " , as it 's fondly known , since long before he took office , and says this is a " huge moment " .
great atmosphere he told me : " it 's good for sport , it 's good for the country , and it 's good for the image of the country .
i think when people in so many countries will see the facility they will be pleasantly surprised at the standards of croke park today . "
and he looked forward to " the buzz that it will create in the north city , bringing new life , new crowds , new sport " .
it 's a magnificent stadium , far superior to dilapidated lansdowne road , south of the river liffey . "
it 's good for sport , it 's good for the country , and it 's good for the image of the country . "
bertie ahern with a full house , there will be a great atmosphere for the rugby matches against france this weekend , and then the much-awaited clash with england later this month .
the first soccer match is against wales next month .
the games have been anticipated for a long time , and even with a much larger stadium capacity , tickets are hard to find .
as sporting venues around the world go , croke park 's history is rich and unique , and helps show why it has , for a long time , held such a special place in the irish psyche .
before and after irish independence from british rule , the gaelic games were celebrated as symbols of irish identity and difference .
soccer and rugby , by comparison , were long referred to as " foreign games " .
at croke park in 1920 , british forces entered the stadium and fired into the crowd .
altogether , 14 people died , including spectators and players .
the hogan stand is named after one of the players killed that day , and the bitter memories of " bloody sunday " have lived on .
gaelic football and hurling are played by amateurs , whereas rugby union and soccer are played by professionals .
the gaelic athletic association , or gaa , is their governing body , a powerful force , with around 750,000 members at more than 2,000 clubs in cities , towns and villages right across ireland .
gaelic centrepiece in 2005 , the gaa voted to lift the rule which used to keep out the other sports , offering soccer and rugby a temporary home while lansdowne road is rebuilt .
before the vote , there was much debate .
some argued that " croker " should remain exclusively for the gaelic games , citing its unique history , and stressing that soccer and rugby were , in many ways , competing with hurling and gaelic football for the leisure time of young people in ireland .
supporters of the switch argued that croke park should be shown off to the world as a symbol of how ireland 's top two , home-grown , sports are thriving and vibrant .
dj carey is a legendary hurling player , widely viewed as the finest of his generation .
he retired last year , but has much experience of playing at croke park on the biggest occasions .
he favoured croke park being opened up , and is looking forward to the first game : " it 's going to be absolutely phenomenal .
" the irish rugby team are used to running out to 35 to 40,000 people at lansdowne road .
that 's going to be doubled for the french and english games , so it 's going to be absolutely terrific . "
dreams a mile or two across dublin , crowds of boys and girls are out training at st vincent 's gaa club on a chilly thursday evening .
the girls are playing camogie , the female version of hurling , and their coach is tom humphries , ireland 's best known sports writer , a columnist on the irish times .
as someone who loves the gaelic games , he explained the emotions involved in the run-up to the ireland-france match on sunday : " this rural-based , volunteer-oriented association still fills the dreams of a majority of the kids here .
the numbers are still coming , and they wo n't make a penny out of it in their careers , but they want to play in croke park - that 's their dream .
that 's why there will be a lot of mixed feelings when croke park opens up , because it has been special for kids who grow up with this kind of sense of place and sense of culture that the games of hurling and football give them . "

the games have been anticipated for a long time , and even with a much larger stadium capacity , tickets are hard to find .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- mobiles switch on with biofuels bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 8 february 2007 , 12:18 gmt mobiles switch on with biofuels fuel derived from cotton and a shrub said to relieve constipation could soon power mobile networks across india .
the crops will be used to generate biodiesel to fuel mobile base stations in unconnected rural areas , without access to electricity .
one third of indian homes are not connected to the power grid and demand for mobile phones is growing rapidly .
a pilot scheme in west india has been set up by mobile firms and industry body the gsma development fund .
" it is about connecting the unconnected , " said dawn hartley , development fund manager at the gsma .
rural connection mobile phone use has exploded across india .
in 2003 there were just 13 million mobile phone subscribers .
today , there are nearly 130 million .
much of this take-up has been in urban areas where there is a comprehensive mobile network .
quick guide : biofuels but outside the major towns , where approximately three-quarters of india 's 1.2 billion people live , mobile coverage is fragmented .
this is in-part because the electricity network , used to power the mobile network infrastructure , is often unreliable and does not cover the whole of the country .
" as gsm operators expand their network coverage into new areas , one of the biggest challenges is to overcome operational issues associated with the lack of basic infrastructure , " said mats granryd , managing director , ericsson india .
remote base stations , which transmit and receive information from handsets , are already powered by conventional fuel generators .
but these can be dirty and require a lot of maintenance .
they can also be expensive to run requiring weekly deliveries of fuel .
ericsson estimates that half of the cost of a remote base station goes on fuel .
clean running the pilot scheme , put forward by the gsma and mobile firms idea cellular and ericsson , hopes to overcome some of these problems by using mobile base stations that use generators running on biodiesel .
the fuel is created by combining plant oils with alcohol , in the presence of a catalyst to speed up the process .
the scheme in india will use oil derived from plants such as cotton , a mahogany-like tree called neem and jatropha .
jatropha trees are already widely grown across india , specifically as a biofuel crop .
the seeds of the plant are a traditional remedy for constipation .
biodiesel has a lower environmental impact than conventional fuels and crucially , can be grown and processed locally .
