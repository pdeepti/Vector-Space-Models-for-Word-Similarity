in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .
in other surveys in the state , the spd claims , the npd is clearly behind it .
naturally , the poll was celebrated by the npd which issued a statement calling the results " sensational . "
npd latches onto dissatisfaction with big parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd in saxony lost points in 2004 but were still upbeat werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden , the saxony state capital , told der spiegel that the figures were " dramatic " and that he thought that the question of social justice , the most important issue for many in the region , had driven the voting .
" the feeling among the populace is that the big parties do not act on its behalf in the state assembly in dresden and the federal government in berlin , " he said .
the npd has become increasingly aware of this dissatisfaction , patzelt said , and was increasingly pushing a motto of " a strong state for the small man . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de council of europe chief : germany must target racism 's roots terry davis , the secretary general of the council of europe , spoke to dw-world.de about the efforts to combat racially motivated violence in germany and the calls by some politicians for the far-right npd to be banned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 07.09.2007 poll : far-right npd overtake social democrats in saxony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people in the state of saxony now support the npd than the spd , the poll claims in a new survey conducted by the forsa institute , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is now less popular than the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in the eastern state of saxony . the spd has suffered a major shock in the german state of saxony in a new poll conducted by the forsa institute .
in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .
in other surveys in the state , the spd claims , the npd is clearly behind it .
naturally , the poll was celebrated by the npd which issued a statement calling the results " sensational . "
npd latches onto dissatisfaction with big parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd in saxony lost points in 2004 but were still upbeat werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden , the saxony state capital , told der spiegel that the figures were " dramatic " and that he thought that the question of social justice , the most important issue for many in the region , had driven the voting .
" the feeling among the populace is that the big parties do not act on its behalf in the state assembly in dresden and the federal government in berlin , " he said .
the npd has become increasingly aware of this dissatisfaction , patzelt said , and was increasingly pushing a motto of " a strong state for the small man . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de council of europe chief : germany must target racism 's roots terry davis , the secretary general of the council of europe , spoke to dw-world.de about the efforts to combat racially motivated violence in germany and the calls by some politicians for the far-right npd to be banned .

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .

the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .

görlitz , who had been criticized for risking the lives of his volunteer crew , made the decision as a fresh storm with force six winds was forecast in the area .

after that storm the crew lashed the remaining three-quarters of the vessel together and continued their journey .
görlitz 's expedition was a form of experimental archaeology . he hoped to test whether his theories about long-distance navigation as long as 14,000 years ago could work in real life .
his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.09.2007 survey pinpoints iraq , bush as main reasons for us-eu rift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poll has found that europeans hold bush largely to blame for strained trans-atlantic ties a new poll has found that us-eu ties are unlikely to recover even after the election of a new american president next year .
at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

however , divisions remained on a number of issues . after chairing the high-level meeting of ministers from the all 16 states , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the country remained under threat from terror attacks . " the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .
computer spying issue resurfaces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government plans to unleash spy viruses continue to cause political rifts the contentious issues of allowing security forces to spy on personal computers and to make attendance at an islamist training camp punishable under german law were again on the security agenda and once more were met with a divided response .
berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "
schäuble has long backed plans to deploy a " government trojan " virus to spy on the computers of terrorist suspects , maintaining that terrorists are making use of the new medium to communicate and that the existing law needs updating to deal with this new concern .
divided along party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's plans have caused divisions in the coalition but german politicians are divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister-party , the christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are inclined to reject them as an intrusion on privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms .
justice minister brigitte zypries , an spd member in merkel 's broad coalition government , repeated her doubts about schäuble 's plans . " it makes no sense to pass legislation in a hurry that will be queried next month , " she told national public television ard friday .
speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .
another suspect had vanished two days before the alleged plot was smashed , according to german media .
the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .
the men had allegedly planned to conduct attacks against us citizens and interests in germany , the newspaper said . as more details of the arrested suspects became available , beckstein added that the three arrested were members of a group of around 50 and that the group had received its directions from abroad . homegrown terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men are in custody as police search for others the apparent leader , identified only as fritz g. , 28 , was reported to be a german from a sound family background who had recently got married . " he was a perfectly normal student , " said herbert jarosch , chancellor at the college in the city of ulm where g. was studying .
the other convert daniel s. , 21 , was reported to have returned to school recently , with the aim of securing admission to university .
experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 .
investigation turns to wider network continuing investigations into the wider network of the would-be bombers have turned their attention to individuals suspected of providing support to the three suspected terrorists , the federal prosecutors ' office said friday .
although the investigators believe the main suspected terror cell has been shut down , they are continuing to investigate at least seven suspects , both in and outside germany , five of whom were known to police , andreas christeleit , a spokesman for the federal prosecutors , told reporters .

speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .
another suspect had vanished two days before the alleged plot was smashed , according to german media .
the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .
the men had allegedly planned to conduct attacks against us citizens and interests in germany , the newspaper said . as more details of the arrested suspects became available , beckstein added that the three arrested were members of a group of around 50 and that the group had received its directions from abroad . homegrown terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men are in custody as police search for others the apparent leader , identified only as fritz g. , 28 , was reported to be a german from a sound family background who had recently got married . " he was a perfectly normal student , " said herbert jarosch , chancellor at the college in the city of ulm where g. was studying .
the other convert daniel s. , 21 , was reported to have returned to school recently , with the aim of securing admission to university .
experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 .
investigation turns to wider network continuing investigations into the wider network of the would-be bombers have turned their attention to individuals suspected of providing support to the three suspected terrorists , the federal prosecutors ' office said friday .
although the investigators believe the main suspected terror cell has been shut down , they are continuing to investigate at least seven suspects , both in and outside germany , five of whom were known to police , andreas christeleit , a spokesman for the federal prosecutors , told reporters .
because the suspects were not currently under suspicion of committing serious crimes , no arrest warrant had been issued for them and they would therefore be free to leave the country , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .
in other surveys in the state , the spd claims , the npd is clearly behind it .
naturally , the poll was celebrated by the npd which issued a statement calling the results " sensational . "
npd latches onto dissatisfaction with big parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd in saxony lost points in 2004 but were still upbeat werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden , the saxony state capital , told der spiegel that the figures were " dramatic " and that he thought that the question of social justice , the most important issue for many in the region , had driven the voting .
" the feeling among the populace is that the big parties do not act on its behalf in the state assembly in dresden and the federal government in berlin , " he said .

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the abora 3 crew , rocked by storms , had to abandon ship after 56 days at sea . a storm ripped apart sections of the reed-hulled sailboat approximately 900 kilometers -lrb- 558 miles -rrb- short of the azore islands , according to a spokesman .
dominique görlitz , a 41-year-old german botanist who conceived the adventure , abandoned ship , along with his crew of 10 .
they were taken aboard an escort boat , which was tracking their progress . looking forward to dropping anchor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the comforts of home the azore islands were intended to be their first landing after leaving new york on july 11 , 2007 , spokesman michael grünert told reporters from the eastern german city of chemnitz . the portuguese islands are about 3,900 kilometers from the united states and 1,500 kilometers from lisbon .
görlitz , who had been criticized for risking the lives of his volunteer crew , made the decision as a fresh storm with force six winds was forecast in the area .
he told his base that it would be irresponsible to keep the crew on the patched-together vessel any longer . weather took its toll on boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abora 3 went without wind and through storms before being abandoned after a long period without wind , a cyclone lasting over three days had ripped off the stern of the abora 3 , which is modeled on ancient rock drawings of river boats and is made of 17 tons of reeds .
after that storm the crew lashed the remaining three-quarters of the vessel together and continued their journey .
görlitz 's expedition was a form of experimental archaeology . he hoped to test whether his theories about long-distance navigation as long as 14,000 years ago could work in real life .
his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 07.09.2007 poll : far-right npd overtake social democrats in saxony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people in the state of saxony now support the npd than the spd , the poll claims in a new survey conducted by the forsa institute , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is now less popular than the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in the eastern state of saxony . the spd has suffered a major shock in the german state of saxony in a new poll conducted by the forsa institute .
in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .

the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .
in other surveys in the state , the spd claims , the npd is clearly behind it .
naturally , the poll was celebrated by the npd which issued a statement calling the results " sensational . "
npd latches onto dissatisfaction with big parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd in saxony lost points in 2004 but were still upbeat werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden , the saxony state capital , told der spiegel that the figures were " dramatic " and that he thought that the question of social justice , the most important issue for many in the region , had driven the voting .
" the feeling among the populace is that the big parties do not act on its behalf in the state assembly in dresden and the federal government in berlin , " he said .
the npd has become increasingly aware of this dissatisfaction , patzelt said , and was increasingly pushing a motto of " a strong state for the small man . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de council of europe chief : germany must target racism 's roots terry davis , the secretary general of the council of europe , spoke to dw-world.de about the efforts to combat racially motivated violence in germany and the calls by some politicians for the far-right npd to be banned .
-lrb- 06.09.2007 -rrb- social democrats press for npd ban despite warnings german social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are pressing for a ban on the far-right npd in the face of warnings from other quarters that the german constitutional court will throw out the case as it did four years ago .
-lrb- 28.08.2007 -rrb- far-right enter fourth german state legislature voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin .
-lrb- 18.09.2006 -rrb- feedback can the forsa poll be taken as an accurate sign of the npd 's perceived growing popularity ?

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .
in other surveys in the state , the spd claims , the npd is clearly behind it .
naturally , the poll was celebrated by the npd which issued a statement calling the results " sensational . "
npd latches onto dissatisfaction with big parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd in saxony lost points in 2004 but were still upbeat werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden , the saxony state capital , told der spiegel that the figures were " dramatic " and that he thought that the question of social justice , the most important issue for many in the region , had driven the voting .
" the feeling among the populace is that the big parties do not act on its behalf in the state assembly in dresden and the federal government in berlin , " he said .

the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .
in other surveys in the state , the spd claims , the npd is clearly behind it .
naturally , the poll was celebrated by the npd which issued a statement calling the results " sensational . "
npd latches onto dissatisfaction with big parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd in saxony lost points in 2004 but were still upbeat werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden , the saxony state capital , told der spiegel that the figures were " dramatic " and that he thought that the question of social justice , the most important issue for many in the region , had driven the voting .
" the feeling among the populace is that the big parties do not act on its behalf in the state assembly in dresden and the federal government in berlin , " he said .
the npd has become increasingly aware of this dissatisfaction , patzelt said , and was increasingly pushing a motto of " a strong state for the small man . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .

berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "

"
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .

the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .

however , divisions remained on a number of issues . after chairing the high-level meeting of ministers from the all 16 states , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the country remained under threat from terror attacks . " the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .
computer spying issue resurfaces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government plans to unleash spy viruses continue to cause political rifts the contentious issues of allowing security forces to spy on personal computers and to make attendance at an islamist training camp punishable under german law were again on the security agenda and once more were met with a divided response .
berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "
schäuble has long backed plans to deploy a " government trojan " virus to spy on the computers of terrorist suspects , maintaining that terrorists are making use of the new medium to communicate and that the existing law needs updating to deal with this new concern .
divided along party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's plans have caused divisions in the coalition but german politicians are divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister-party , the christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are inclined to reject them as an intrusion on privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms .
justice minister brigitte zypries , an spd member in merkel 's broad coalition government , repeated her doubts about schäuble 's plans . " it makes no sense to pass legislation in a hurry that will be queried next month , " she told national public television ard friday .
speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .

however , divisions remained on a number of issues . after chairing the high-level meeting of ministers from the all 16 states , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the country remained under threat from terror attacks . " the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .
computer spying issue resurfaces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government plans to unleash spy viruses continue to cause political rifts the contentious issues of allowing security forces to spy on personal computers and to make attendance at an islamist training camp punishable under german law were again on the security agenda and once more were met with a divided response .
berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "
schäuble has long backed plans to deploy a " government trojan " virus to spy on the computers of terrorist suspects , maintaining that terrorists are making use of the new medium to communicate and that the existing law needs updating to deal with this new concern .
divided along party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's plans have caused divisions in the coalition but german politicians are divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister-party , the christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are inclined to reject them as an intrusion on privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms .
justice minister brigitte zypries , an spd member in merkel 's broad coalition government , repeated her doubts about schäuble 's plans . " it makes no sense to pass legislation in a hurry that will be queried next month , " she told national public television ard friday .
speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .
another suspect had vanished two days before the alleged plot was smashed , according to german media .
the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .
the men had allegedly planned to conduct attacks against us citizens and interests in germany , the newspaper said . as more details of the arrested suspects became available , beckstein added that the three arrested were members of a group of around 50 and that the group had received its directions from abroad . homegrown terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men are in custody as police search for others the apparent leader , identified only as fritz g. , 28 , was reported to be a german from a sound family background who had recently got married . " he was a perfectly normal student , " said herbert jarosch , chancellor at the college in the city of ulm where g. was studying .
the other convert daniel s. , 21 , was reported to have returned to school recently , with the aim of securing admission to university .
experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 .
investigation turns to wider network continuing investigations into the wider network of the would-be bombers have turned their attention to individuals suspected of providing support to the three suspected terrorists , the federal prosecutors ' office said friday .
although the investigators believe the main suspected terror cell has been shut down , they are continuing to investigate at least seven suspects , both in and outside germany , five of whom were known to police , andreas christeleit , a spokesman for the federal prosecutors , told reporters .
because the suspects were not currently under suspicion of committing serious crimes , no arrest warrant had been issued for them and they would therefore be free to leave the country , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2007 russia hopes to lure back ethnic germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel with ethnic germans in the siberian city of tomsk last year around 2.3 million ethnic germans from the former soviet union have emigrated to germany since 1991 .
faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .

those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction .

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the abora 3 crew , rocked by storms , had to abandon ship after 56 days at sea . a storm ripped apart sections of the reed-hulled sailboat approximately 900 kilometers -lrb- 558 miles -rrb- short of the azore islands , according to a spokesman .

görlitz , who had been criticized for risking the lives of his volunteer crew , made the decision as a fresh storm with force six winds was forecast in the area .

after that storm the crew lashed the remaining three-quarters of the vessel together and continued their journey .
görlitz 's expedition was a form of experimental archaeology . he hoped to test whether his theories about long-distance navigation as long as 14,000 years ago could work in real life .
his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .

while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .

" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2007 russia hopes to lure back ethnic germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel with ethnic germans in the siberian city of tomsk last year around 2.3 million ethnic germans from the former soviet union have emigrated to germany since 1991 .
faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .

while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .

" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

" angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

görlitz , who had been criticized for risking the lives of his volunteer crew , made the decision as a fresh storm with force six winds was forecast in the area .

after that storm the crew lashed the remaining three-quarters of the vessel together and continued their journey .
görlitz 's expedition was a form of experimental archaeology . he hoped to test whether his theories about long-distance navigation as long as 14,000 years ago could work in real life .
his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .

over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2007 russia hopes to lure back ethnic germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel with ethnic germans in the siberian city of tomsk last year around 2.3 million ethnic germans from the former soviet union have emigrated to germany since 1991 .
faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.09.2007 survey pinpoints iraq , bush as main reasons for us-eu rift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poll has found that europeans hold bush largely to blame for strained trans-atlantic ties a new poll has found that us-eu ties are unlikely to recover even after the election of a new american president next year .
at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .

according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2007 russia hopes to lure back ethnic germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel with ethnic germans in the siberian city of tomsk last year around 2.3 million ethnic germans from the former soviet union have emigrated to germany since 1991 .
faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.09.2007 survey pinpoints iraq , bush as main reasons for us-eu rift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poll has found that europeans hold bush largely to blame for strained trans-atlantic ties a new poll has found that us-eu ties are unlikely to recover even after the election of a new american president next year .
at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the abora 3 crew , rocked by storms , had to abandon ship after 56 days at sea . a storm ripped apart sections of the reed-hulled sailboat approximately 900 kilometers -lrb- 558 miles -rrb- short of the azore islands , according to a spokesman .
dominique görlitz , a 41-year-old german botanist who conceived the adventure , abandoned ship , along with his crew of 10 .
they were taken aboard an escort boat , which was tracking their progress . looking forward to dropping anchor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the comforts of home the azore islands were intended to be their first landing after leaving new york on july 11 , 2007 , spokesman michael grünert told reporters from the eastern german city of chemnitz . the portuguese islands are about 3,900 kilometers from the united states and 1,500 kilometers from lisbon .
görlitz , who had been criticized for risking the lives of his volunteer crew , made the decision as a fresh storm with force six winds was forecast in the area .
he told his base that it would be irresponsible to keep the crew on the patched-together vessel any longer . weather took its toll on boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abora 3 went without wind and through storms before being abandoned after a long period without wind , a cyclone lasting over three days had ripped off the stern of the abora 3 , which is modeled on ancient rock drawings of river boats and is made of 17 tons of reeds .
after that storm the crew lashed the remaining three-quarters of the vessel together and continued their journey .
görlitz 's expedition was a form of experimental archaeology . he hoped to test whether his theories about long-distance navigation as long as 14,000 years ago could work in real life .
his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

however , divisions remained on a number of issues . after chairing the high-level meeting of ministers from the all 16 states , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the country remained under threat from terror attacks . " the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .
computer spying issue resurfaces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government plans to unleash spy viruses continue to cause political rifts the contentious issues of allowing security forces to spy on personal computers and to make attendance at an islamist training camp punishable under german law were again on the security agenda and once more were met with a divided response .
berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "
schäuble has long backed plans to deploy a " government trojan " virus to spy on the computers of terrorist suspects , maintaining that terrorists are making use of the new medium to communicate and that the existing law needs updating to deal with this new concern .
divided along party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's plans have caused divisions in the coalition but german politicians are divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister-party , the christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are inclined to reject them as an intrusion on privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms .
justice minister brigitte zypries , an spd member in merkel 's broad coalition government , repeated her doubts about schäuble 's plans . " it makes no sense to pass legislation in a hurry that will be queried next month , " she told national public television ard friday .
speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .
another suspect had vanished two days before the alleged plot was smashed , according to german media .
the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .
the men had allegedly planned to conduct attacks against us citizens and interests in germany , the newspaper said . as more details of the arrested suspects became available , beckstein added that the three arrested were members of a group of around 50 and that the group had received its directions from abroad . homegrown terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men are in custody as police search for others the apparent leader , identified only as fritz g. , 28 , was reported to be a german from a sound family background who had recently got married . " he was a perfectly normal student , " said herbert jarosch , chancellor at the college in the city of ulm where g. was studying .
the other convert daniel s. , 21 , was reported to have returned to school recently , with the aim of securing admission to university .
experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 .
investigation turns to wider network continuing investigations into the wider network of the would-be bombers have turned their attention to individuals suspected of providing support to the three suspected terrorists , the federal prosecutors ' office said friday .
although the investigators believe the main suspected terror cell has been shut down , they are continuing to investigate at least seven suspects , both in and outside germany , five of whom were known to police , andreas christeleit , a spokesman for the federal prosecutors , told reporters .
because the suspects were not currently under suspicion of committing serious crimes , no arrest warrant had been issued for them and they would therefore be free to leave the country , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , divisions remained on a number of issues . after chairing the high-level meeting of ministers from the all 16 states , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the country remained under threat from terror attacks . " the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .
computer spying issue resurfaces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government plans to unleash spy viruses continue to cause political rifts the contentious issues of allowing security forces to spy on personal computers and to make attendance at an islamist training camp punishable under german law were again on the security agenda and once more were met with a divided response .
berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "
schäuble has long backed plans to deploy a " government trojan " virus to spy on the computers of terrorist suspects , maintaining that terrorists are making use of the new medium to communicate and that the existing law needs updating to deal with this new concern .
divided along party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's plans have caused divisions in the coalition but german politicians are divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister-party , the christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are inclined to reject them as an intrusion on privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms .
justice minister brigitte zypries , an spd member in merkel 's broad coalition government , repeated her doubts about schäuble 's plans . " it makes no sense to pass legislation in a hurry that will be queried next month , " she told national public television ard friday .
speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .
another suspect had vanished two days before the alleged plot was smashed , according to german media .
the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .
the men had allegedly planned to conduct attacks against us citizens and interests in germany , the newspaper said . as more details of the arrested suspects became available , beckstein added that the three arrested were members of a group of around 50 and that the group had received its directions from abroad . homegrown terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men are in custody as police search for others the apparent leader , identified only as fritz g. , 28 , was reported to be a german from a sound family background who had recently got married . " he was a perfectly normal student , " said herbert jarosch , chancellor at the college in the city of ulm where g. was studying .
the other convert daniel s. , 21 , was reported to have returned to school recently , with the aim of securing admission to university .
experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 .
investigation turns to wider network continuing investigations into the wider network of the would-be bombers have turned their attention to individuals suspected of providing support to the three suspected terrorists , the federal prosecutors ' office said friday .
although the investigators believe the main suspected terror cell has been shut down , they are continuing to investigate at least seven suspects , both in and outside germany , five of whom were known to police , andreas christeleit , a spokesman for the federal prosecutors , told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2007 russia hopes to lure back ethnic germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel with ethnic germans in the siberian city of tomsk last year around 2.3 million ethnic germans from the former soviet union have emigrated to germany since 1991 .
faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , divisions remained on a number of issues . after chairing the high-level meeting of ministers from the all 16 states , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the country remained under threat from terror attacks . " the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .
computer spying issue resurfaces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government plans to unleash spy viruses continue to cause political rifts the contentious issues of allowing security forces to spy on personal computers and to make attendance at an islamist training camp punishable under german law were again on the security agenda and once more were met with a divided response .
berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "
schäuble has long backed plans to deploy a " government trojan " virus to spy on the computers of terrorist suspects , maintaining that terrorists are making use of the new medium to communicate and that the existing law needs updating to deal with this new concern .
divided along party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's plans have caused divisions in the coalition but german politicians are divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister-party , the christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are inclined to reject them as an intrusion on privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms .
justice minister brigitte zypries , an spd member in merkel 's broad coalition government , repeated her doubts about schäuble 's plans . " it makes no sense to pass legislation in a hurry that will be queried next month , " she told national public television ard friday .
speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .
another suspect had vanished two days before the alleged plot was smashed , according to german media .
the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .
the men had allegedly planned to conduct attacks against us citizens and interests in germany , the newspaper said . as more details of the arrested suspects became available , beckstein added that the three arrested were members of a group of around 50 and that the group had received its directions from abroad . homegrown terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men are in custody as police search for others the apparent leader , identified only as fritz g. , 28 , was reported to be a german from a sound family background who had recently got married . " he was a perfectly normal student , " said herbert jarosch , chancellor at the college in the city of ulm where g. was studying .
the other convert daniel s. , 21 , was reported to have returned to school recently , with the aim of securing admission to university .
experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 .
investigation turns to wider network continuing investigations into the wider network of the would-be bombers have turned their attention to individuals suspected of providing support to the three suspected terrorists , the federal prosecutors ' office said friday .
although the investigators believe the main suspected terror cell has been shut down , they are continuing to investigate at least seven suspects , both in and outside germany , five of whom were known to police , andreas christeleit , a spokesman for the federal prosecutors , told reporters .
because the suspects were not currently under suspicion of committing serious crimes , no arrest warrant had been issued for them and they would therefore be free to leave the country , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .

russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said .

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .
only 30 percent of europeans polled shared that opinion . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats . the results , published thursday this week , point to two overarching reasons for continuing european skepticism towards america and its policies - the iraq war and president george w. bush . the survey conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and four european foundations was based on more than 1,000 interviews conducted in 11 eu states , turkey and the us in june this year . iraq war , bush to blame respondents in both the us and europe agreed on why relations had declined in recent years .
thirty-eight percent on both continents said the handling of the iraq war was the most important factor .
thirty-nine percent of americans said bush 's personal style had been the biggest reason for the souring of trans-atlantic ties , while 34 percent of europeans cited us president .
john glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund told german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the fact that both americans and europeans agreed on why ties had deteriorated shows " our figures are in no way proof of european anti-americanism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-led war in iraq has hugely strained the us-eu relationship though more than three-quarters of europeans polled said they disapproved of bush 's foreign policy , only slightly more than a third said they believed relations would improve under a new president .
a majority of europeans , 56 percent , said us leadership in world affairs was undesirable . despite the rise of new political leaders in germany , britain and france , half the americans surveyed and one third of the europeans said trans-atlantic ties had worsened in the last year . " angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and gordon brown may offer a new spirit of cooperation in trans-atlantic relations in europe , but this year 's transatlantic trends suggest they will need to tread carefully , " the survey 's organizers were quoted as saying by reuters news agency . united in shared fears despite the pessimistic outlook on the future of trans-atlantic relations , the survey also found that europeans remained open to working with the us to tackle global threats .
slightly more than half were in favor of the eu cooperating with washington to deal with security threats . at the same time , the poll said europeans and americans increasingly share the same fears .
in both places , those surveyed listed energy dependence among the top three threats they saw as most likely to affect them . international terrorism also figured large with about two-thirds of europeans citing it as a big worry compared with almost three-quarters of americans .
the fear of international terrorism has risen in europe by 17 percentage points since a similar survey in 2005 .
the 2007 survey was conducted before recent arrests of alleged terror suspects in germany and denmark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials arrested two islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in germany , particularly , 70 percent of respondents said they worried being affected by global terrorism , up by 32 percent since 2005 . germany has been shaken by reports in recent years of planned terrorist attacks .
in july last year , two bombs placed on commuter trains failed to explode .
this week , police arrested three islamic militants accused of planning bomb attacks on american targets in germany . global warming topped the european list of biggest fears at 85 percent .
despite popular perception in europe that the us has done little to curb climate change , 70 percent of americans said global warming was likely to affect them . differing views on use of force americans and europeans , however , remain far apart on the question of whether the west should deal with threats with military force . forty-seven percent of americans polled said they were in favor of using the threat of force if tehran insisted on developing its nuclear program as against just 18 percent of europeans . similarly , more than two-thirds of americans said they supported sending their soldiers into combat with rebel taliban fighters in afghanistan .

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .

spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "

görlitz 's expedition was a form of experimental archaeology . he hoped to test whether his theories about long-distance navigation as long as 14,000 years ago could work in real life .
his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

görlitz , who had been criticized for risking the lives of his volunteer crew , made the decision as a fresh storm with force six winds was forecast in the area .

after that storm the crew lashed the remaining three-quarters of the vessel together and continued their journey .
görlitz 's expedition was a form of experimental archaeology . he hoped to test whether his theories about long-distance navigation as long as 14,000 years ago could work in real life .
his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

his inspiration came from norwegian adventurer thor heyerdahl whose reed vessel ra ii sailed westwards with prevailing winds over the ocean in 1970 .

faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 07.09.2007 debate on terror in germany highlights political divisions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are unsure on how to deal with the threat of homegrown terrorism just days after german security forces thwarted a " massive " terror attack , the country 's state interior ministers met to discuss the current terrorist threat .
however , divisions remained on a number of issues . after chairing the high-level meeting of ministers from the all 16 states , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the country remained under threat from terror attacks . " the threat is very strong , and we can not presume that it has passed , " schäuble told reporters in berlin .
the emergency ministers ' meeting again highlighted the differences many feel are hindering further progress in germany 's fight against terrorism .
computer spying issue resurfaces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government plans to unleash spy viruses continue to cause political rifts the contentious issues of allowing security forces to spy on personal computers and to make attendance at an islamist training camp punishable under german law were again on the security agenda and once more were met with a divided response .
berlin interior senator ehrhart körting said opinion was divided among the ministers , although there was unity that people who had undergone paramilitary training at terrorist camps " should be taken out of circulation . "
schäuble has long backed plans to deploy a " government trojan " virus to spy on the computers of terrorist suspects , maintaining that terrorists are making use of the new medium to communicate and that the existing law needs updating to deal with this new concern .
divided along party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's plans have caused divisions in the coalition but german politicians are divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister-party , the christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are inclined to reject them as an intrusion on privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms .
justice minister brigitte zypries , an spd member in merkel 's broad coalition government , repeated her doubts about schäuble 's plans . " it makes no sense to pass legislation in a hurry that will be queried next month , " she told national public television ard friday .
speaking on the sidelines of the berlin meeting , bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , who has a hard-line reputation on security issues , said in reference to tuesday 's arrest of three terror suspects that online searches were " well suited and necessary to check how far this network extends . "
spd member körting broke ranks with his party , saying the law allowing letters and phone calls to be intercepted had to be extended to the new means of communication .
still , he warned that " the private sphere should not be infringed " by excessive security measures . ralf stegner , interior minister for the north-western state of schleswig-holstein and an spd member , referred to another issue that has come to the fore since the foiled german terror plot : the radicalism among some converts to islam those who had converted to islam " should not become suspect " simply for this reason , he said . bomb plot aimed at us interests in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport and the ramstein air base were rumored targets three men - two german converts to islam and a turk - were arrested and had been under surveillance for weeks for stockpiling chemicals to make bombs , prosecutors said .
another suspect had vanished two days before the alleged plot was smashed , according to german media .
the missing suspect was a german convert to islam in his 20s who shared a flat with one of the men arrested on wednesday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported friday .
the men had allegedly planned to conduct attacks against us citizens and interests in germany , the newspaper said . as more details of the arrested suspects became available , beckstein added that the three arrested were members of a group of around 50 and that the group had received its directions from abroad . homegrown terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men are in custody as police search for others the apparent leader , identified only as fritz g. , 28 , was reported to be a german from a sound family background who had recently got married . " he was a perfectly normal student , " said herbert jarosch , chancellor at the college in the city of ulm where g. was studying .
the other convert daniel s. , 21 , was reported to have returned to school recently , with the aim of securing admission to university .
experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 .
investigation turns to wider network continuing investigations into the wider network of the would-be bombers have turned their attention to individuals suspected of providing support to the three suspected terrorists , the federal prosecutors ' office said friday .
although the investigators believe the main suspected terror cell has been shut down , they are continuing to investigate at least seven suspects , both in and outside germany , five of whom were known to police , andreas christeleit , a spokesman for the federal prosecutors , told reporters .
because the suspects were not currently under suspicion of committing serious crimes , no arrest warrant had been issued for them and they would therefore be free to leave the country , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in results that is bound to reverberate across the whole of germany , the far-right npd has overtaken the spd for the first time ever in an opinion poll .
it has been a rough few weeks for state premier georg milbradt .
the christian democrat prime minister in saxony has had to deal with a corruption affair , a racially motivated attack on indians in mügeln that made international headlines and the near-collapse of the state bank , among other things .
but even he would admit that losing two percentage points in the forsa poll would be preferable to the result the spd was presented with .
the popularity of milbradt 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- dropped to 39 percent in the survey about political allegiance in the state .
social democrats meanwhile face a nightmare scenario where they are now below their previous lowest level , dropping from 9.8 percent to just 8 percent .
they now sit behind the npd , which polled 9 percent of votes .
spd drops below worst level in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu triumphed in 2004 but the spd slumped dramatically in the state elections in 2004 , the spd recorded its worst result but even then it was marginally more than the npd 's 9.2 percent .
while the far-right party has also dropped points in the current poll , the fact is that the spd is now seen as even less popular than a right-wing extremist party in the state of saxony .
the spd was hardly a force to begin with - sitting behind the cdu and the left party -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- but ahead of the free-market liberal fdp -lrb- 7 percent -rrb- and the greens -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- .
but the impact of being beaten further down , and by the far-right , will not only have implications in the state , but potentially across the country .
" the fact that poll shows the npd ahead of us can not be , " martin dulig , the spd 's parliamentary faction leader in saxony told german news magazine der spiegel 's web site .
" i can not be compared with nazis . "
the spd has often questioned the forsa institute 's findings , saying that it always gets terrible results in its polls .
in other surveys in the state , the spd claims , the npd is clearly behind it .
naturally , the poll was celebrated by the npd which issued a statement calling the results " sensational . "
npd latches onto dissatisfaction with big parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd in saxony lost points in 2004 but were still upbeat werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden , the saxony state capital , told der spiegel that the figures were " dramatic " and that he thought that the question of social justice , the most important issue for many in the region , had driven the voting .
" the feeling among the populace is that the big parties do not act on its behalf in the state assembly in dresden and the federal government in berlin , " he said .

a new recipe for coal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus antonietti from the max-planck institute has developed a simple but ingenious way of producing coal using biomass - such as waste from the garden or leaves from the local forest . the process is environmentally friendly , as the only by-product is water - not carbon dioxide which would contribute to global warming .
antonietti has successfully managed to develop this method so that it could be used for commercial coal production .
such coal could just be used for heating purposes , but it could be used far more effectively in electricity and gasoline production .
the 70 million tonnes of biomass that germany produces every year would be sufficient to cover the country 's energy needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2007 russia hopes to lure back ethnic germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel with ethnic germans in the siberian city of tomsk last year around 2.3 million ethnic germans from the former soviet union have emigrated to germany since 1991 .
faced with a demographic crisis , russia is now trying to woo them back . russian news agency interfax reported this week that moscow will spend over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- by 2012 to entice back former citizens of german descent who have immigrated to germany as well as to stem the further westward flight of its ethnic german minority .
the money is to be mainly invested in industrial centers in western siberia and the volga region . german immigrants were invited to russia during the 18th century by czarina catherine the great , herself a german princess .
oppressed during the soviet era , their descendants were sent into forced exile to kazakhstan and other remote areas by soviet dictator josef stalin . with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , some 2.3 million of them had come to germany by 2005 , drawn by nearly automatic citizenship offered by berlin and a desire to get to know their roots .
ethnic german emigrants from russia make up the largest group of the 4.5 million people with ethnic german heritage who migrated to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classroom in a german high school in tomsk , siberia russia 's efforts to help the social and economic development of its remaining and dwindling ethnic german community - 600,000 , according to official figures - have been welcomed by berlin .
over the past years , president vladimir putin 's administration , aided by generous financial backing from the german government , has launched a number of programs towards that purpose . berlin not happy with russian stance but moscow 's efforts to lure back its former citizens now living in germany in order to plug domestic labor shortages have sparked a less than enthusiastic response in berlin . with one of the world 's lowest life expectancy rates and falling birth rates , russia faces a demographic problem with economic consequences .
according to a un study , russia will need two million immigrants in the next decade to maintain economic growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin offered a package of incentives for ethnic germans living abroad last year , putin 's government invested heavily in infrastructure and housing in siberia , particularly in the city of novosibirsk , to draw ethnic germans living abroad .
those who returned were offered 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,106 -rrb- , travel compensation and free transportation of their belongings . the german government 's commissioner for ethnic germans and national minorities , christoph bergner , emphasized that the german government will " not guarantee any support , either financial or moral , " to ethnic germans wishing to move back to russia . speaking at a press conference last month in the economically flourishing russian exclave of kaliningrad , bergner said no one could expect berlin to promote the flight of young , skilled workers at a time when germany itself was struggling with a low birth rate and major skills shortage . getting ready to leave again experts , however , point out that the reverse migratory trend is already underway with ethnic germans who migrated to germany packing their bags for russia . elmar welt , who works for a charity called " heimgarten , " which was founded to help the repatriation of war refugees , said the organization has been sought out by over 700 russian-germans wishing to move back to russia and parts of the former soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older ethnic germans living in germany sometimes want to go back to russia for personal reasons while some want to go back because they feel isolated , miss russian culture and have problems learning the german language , welt said , the prospect of getting well-valued work remains a major attraction . " many ethnic germans in germany suffer from complexes because their degrees are n't recognized in germany with the result that you have teachers and engineers working as cleaning staff , " said welt .
" now , they have a chance to use their skills . " according to the organization , kazakhstan alone over the past two years has awarded new passports to over 2,000 ethnic germans returning from germany . just a trickle whatever drives an ethnic german to return to russia , some say it would be a mistake to make too much of the numbers opting to go back to the former soviet union .
reports differ on the actual number .
russian web site " russland-aktuell " reported that in kaliningrad , despite 12,000 enquires since last year , only 17 people had moved to the booming russian exclave - most of them russian families from latvia . viktor krieger , an expert on russia at the university of heidelberg , said only a fraction of ethnic germans in germany were leaving . " more than 95 percent of them are staying because they 're rooted here in germany and are treated as equals , " krieger said .
" you have to actually wonder why so few are going back . " the problem with moscow 's plans to lure back ethnic germans was that it failed to mention a single word about revitalizing the ethnic german community in russia and focuses on developing agriculture and rural areas , krieger said . " there 's nothing in there about setting up a german museum , a university or a research institute for ethnic german culture , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new recipe for coal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus antonietti from the max-planck institute has developed a simple but ingenious way of producing coal using biomass - such as waste from the garden or leaves from the local forest . the process is environmentally friendly , as the only by-product is water - not carbon dioxide which would contribute to global warming .
antonietti has successfully managed to develop this method so that it could be used for commercial coal production .
such coal could just be used for heating purposes , but it could be used far more effectively in electricity and gasoline production .
the 70 million tonnes of biomass that germany produces every year would be sufficient to cover the country 's energy needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have called on assembly government ministers to reduce the availability of cigarettes .
the minimum age for buying tobacco rises from 16 to 18 next month .
the chief medical officer for wales welcomed the support " to discourage young people from taking up the habit " .
pro-smoking lobby group forest called bma wales 's ideas " absurd " and called for education on lifestyle choice .
from 1 october , the minimum age for buying tobacco products will increase from 16 to 18 years in a bid to cut the number of young smokers .
wales banned smoking in public places in april , 13 weeks before england .
bma wales five-point plan ban cigarette vending machines ban packs of 10 license tobacco sales outlets ban cigarette display stands more " stop-smoking " work bma cymru wales said the ban would save 400 lives a year in wales although smoking among young people remained " stubbornly high " .
it said ministers should take five short and long-term measures to tackle teen smoking .
the bma 's welsh secretary dr richard lewis said : " most smokers begin in adolescence and the younger someone starts smoking , the less likely they are to give up .
" we must restrict access to cigarettes to young people .
" one of the ways that we can do this is to ban vending machines and restrict the sale of packs of 10 .
we must do all we can to stop youngsters getting hooked in the first place . "
bma wales wants the sale of tobacco to be licensed in the same way as alcohol , with cigarettes also banned from being on display in stores .
the bma in scotland called for similar measures today .
the organisation at a uk level earlier this year produced a report to look at ways of " breaking the cycle " of children 's exposure to tobacco smoke .
the doctors ' action plan also calls for young people 's attitude to smoking to be challenged through " continual investment in smoking prevention and cessation services " .
neil rafferty , spokesperson for the freedom of the right to enjoy smoking tobacco -lrb- forest -rrb- , agreed that smoking was " very much a choice for adults to make " but criticised bma wales 's ideas on how to cut teenage smoking .
he said : " banning vending machines will only deny choice to adults .
" the idea of banning a pack of 10 is absurd .
if teenagers can afford to buy a pack of 10 twice a week , they can afford to buy a pack of 20 .
" it 's nothing more than a gesture from the bma and they should go back to the drawing board and think up something sensible .
" what we need to do is educate teenagers better about the choices they can make in their lives as adults , rather than constantly taking away choice from adults . "
a spokesman for dr tony jewell , chief medical officer for wales , said : " the assembly government has invested in a range of initiatives to educate young people so that they do not start smoking .
" we are supporting the move to raise the legal age at which people can buy tobacco from 16 to 18 on 1 october .
" the ban on smoking in enclosed public places will also have a huge impact on the health of the people of wales and we expect it help more smokers to quit .
" the all wales smoking cessation service has reported that since the ban was introduced they have seen an increase in the number of people contacting them throughout wales rise by about 10 % . "

they have called on assembly government ministers to reduce the availability of cigarettes .
the minimum age for buying tobacco rises from 16 to 18 next month .
the chief medical officer for wales welcomed the support " to discourage young people from taking up the habit " .
pro-smoking lobby group forest called bma wales 's ideas " absurd " and called for education on lifestyle choice .
from 1 october , the minimum age for buying tobacco products will increase from 16 to 18 years in a bid to cut the number of young smokers .
wales banned smoking in public places in april , 13 weeks before england .
bma wales five-point plan ban cigarette vending machines ban packs of 10 license tobacco sales outlets ban cigarette display stands more " stop-smoking " work bma cymru wales said the ban would save 400 lives a year in wales although smoking among young people remained " stubbornly high " .
it said ministers should take five short and long-term measures to tackle teen smoking .
the bma 's welsh secretary dr richard lewis said : " most smokers begin in adolescence and the younger someone starts smoking , the less likely they are to give up .
" we must restrict access to cigarettes to young people .
" one of the ways that we can do this is to ban vending machines and restrict the sale of packs of 10 .
we must do all we can to stop youngsters getting hooked in the first place . "
bma wales wants the sale of tobacco to be licensed in the same way as alcohol , with cigarettes also banned from being on display in stores .
the bma in scotland called for similar measures today .
the organisation at a uk level earlier this year produced a report to look at ways of " breaking the cycle " of children 's exposure to tobacco smoke .
the legal age for buying tobacco rises to 18 from next month the doctors ' action plan also calls for young people 's attitude to smoking to be challenged through " continual investment in smoking prevention and cessation services " .
neil rafferty , spokesperson for the freedom of the right to enjoy smoking tobacco -lrb- forest -rrb- , agreed that smoking was " very much a choice for adults to make " but criticised bma wales 's ideas on how to cut teenage smoking .
he said : " banning vending machines will only deny choice to adults .
" the idea of banning a pack of 10 is absurd .
if teenagers can afford to buy a pack of 10 twice a week , they can afford to buy a pack of 20 .
" it 's nothing more than a gesture from the bma and they should go back to the drawing board and think up something sensible .
" what we need to do is educate teenagers better about the choices they can make in their lives as adults , rather than constantly taking away choice from adults . "
a spokesman for dr tony jewell , chief medical officer for wales , said : " the assembly government has invested in a range of initiatives to educate young people so that they do not start smoking .
" we are supporting the move to raise the legal age at which people can buy tobacco from 16 to 18 on 1 october .
" the ban on smoking in enclosed public places will also have a huge impact on the health of the people of wales and we expect it help more smokers to quit .
" the all wales smoking cessation service has reported that since the ban was introduced they have seen an increase in the number of people contacting them throughout wales rise by about 10 % . "

like-for-like sales were just 1.1 % higher in august , against a 5.3 % rise in july , a month after the smoking ban came into force in england in july .
as a result the firm warned its outlook for like-for-like sales in 2008 remained " cautious " .
the alert came as wetherspoon said full year pre-tax profits rose 9 % to £ 62m .
' remaining cautious ' the group added that the figures for the year to july 29 had been buoyed by a 5.6 % rise in like-for-like sales , driven by growing food sales .
a combination of food sales and drinks bought to go with table meals now accounts for about two thirds of wetherspoon 's sales .
" given the smoking bans and our experience in scotland , our outlook for like-for-like sales for the 2008 financial year remains cautious , as it involves more uncertainty than usual , " chairman tim martin said .
" although we have no doubt that this legislation will be to the long-term benefit of the licensed trade . "

as a result the firm warned its outlook for like-for-like sales in 2008 remained " cautious " .

the scot performed in greek tragedy the bacchae at the edinburgh festival , which is poised to open in london .
as a hollywood star , the 42-year-old lives in the us and has become famous for his roles in blockbusters such as x-men 2 and goldeneye .
he told bbc world service 's the ticket programme that as a result his comeback had been " hyped like crazy " .
" when we were at the edinburgh festival , every magazine you looked at had my face on it , " he says .
" it was a big ' prodigal son returning ' thing , which was a bit scary because of the weight of expectation , and you hope you do n't disappoint people .
" at the same time , there 's this grounding thing of being back with people i used to go to drama school with .
so it 's been a nice combination , " adds cumming .
parallels the bacchae , written by euripides in 405 bc , centres on dionysus , the greek god of wine .
having spent much time in asia , dionysus returns with his followers - the bacchae of the title - to put right a family betrayal .
his arrival has a dramatic effect on the women of the city of thebes , sending them into an ecstatic frenzy .
i think that 's a misconception about greek tragedy in general .
there 's a lot of humour alan cumming cumming says that he performs dionysus as a rock star , with the bacchae as the backing singers .
and he explained that there were " interesting parallels " between the play 's hero and himself .
cumming said that he had been attracted to the bacchae both because of its theme and the personnel surrounding it .
" i really liked the idea that someone who had so much power could feel so vulnerable about not being accepted by his family .
" also , i wanted to work with director john tiffany , and with the national theatre of scotland .
this just seemed like the perfect match for everything . "
critics have termed the play " wacky bacchae " partly because of cummings ' entrance swinging upside-down in a gold lame kilt .
new film but the actor says that any perception that the tragedy has been radically reinterpreted as comedy is incorrect .
" we found that when we were rehearsing , david greig , who adapted it , said he actually felt he had to take the humour down a little , because it would be getting the wrong response . "
" i think that 's a misconception about greek tragedy in general .
there 's a lot of humour - dark humour , of course - and they used humour about perceptions of men , women and social issues at the time . "
maria callas has been a long-term project for dunaway cumming - who won a tony award for his performance in cabaret - says that he found stage much more exciting and challenging that film .
" you have this visceral reaction from an audience , and i prefer it a lot more as an experience , " he says .
" it 's like doing an extreme sport - you get a thrill from it you do n't get from a normal sport . "
cumming has a new film project lined up for after the bacchae finishes in london - a biopic of the singer maria callas .
the film , based on the book masterclass by terrance mcnally , is being directed by faye dunaway , who will also play callas .
cumming will play her accompanist .
" she 's just so passionate about it .

the scot performed in greek tragedy the bacchae at the edinburgh festival , which is poised to open in london .
as a hollywood star , the 42-year-old lives in the us and has become famous for his roles in blockbusters such as x-men 2 and goldeneye .
he told bbc world service 's the ticket programme that as a result his comeback had been " hyped like crazy " .
" when we were at the edinburgh festival , every magazine you looked at had my face on it , " he says .
" it was a big ' prodigal son returning ' thing , which was a bit scary because of the weight of expectation , and you hope you do n't disappoint people .
" at the same time , there 's this grounding thing of being back with people i used to go to drama school with .
so it 's been a nice combination , " adds cumming .
parallels the bacchae , written by euripides in 405 bc , centres on dionysus , the greek god of wine .
having spent much time in asia , dionysus returns with his followers - the bacchae of the title - to put right a family betrayal .
his arrival has a dramatic effect on the women of the city of thebes , sending them into an ecstatic frenzy .
i think that 's a misconception about greek tragedy in general .
there 's a lot of humour alan cumming cumming says that he performs dionysus as a rock star , with the bacchae as the backing singers .
and he explained that there were " interesting parallels " between the play 's hero and himself .
cumming said that he had been attracted to the bacchae both because of its theme and the personnel surrounding it .
" i really liked the idea that someone who had so much power could feel so vulnerable about not being accepted by his family .
" also , i wanted to work with director john tiffany , and with the national theatre of scotland .
this just seemed like the perfect match for everything . "
critics have termed the play " wacky bacchae " partly because of cummings ' entrance swinging upside-down in a gold lame kilt .
new film but the actor says that any perception that the tragedy has been radically reinterpreted as comedy is incorrect .
" we found that when we were rehearsing , david greig , who adapted it , said he actually felt he had to take the humour down a little , because it would be getting the wrong response . "

organisations contacted by bbc scotland said there was a willingness across all social groups to " go green " .
however , they added that people who were struggling financially found it difficult to make their shopping and homes eco-friendly .
friends of the earth said green living was harder for poorer families .
duncan mclaren , chief executive of the organisation , said many lifestyle changes such as switching lights and appliances off when they were not in use cost nothing .
" however , we need politicians to work together more to make it cheaper and easier for everyone to live a greener lifestyle , " he added . "
when you are struggling to eat and heat your home your last priority is to go green " lindsay scott help the aged help the aged said older people on low incomes were keen to be environmentally-friendly , but more often the priority was spending money on heating their homes .
lindsay scott , communications manager , said : " there are people whose circumstances are vastly below the poverty line , living on £ 46-a-week , and can not afford to go green .
" they have to buy frozen food from the cheapest places .
" there are others at the other end who drive lpg 4x4s , have energy efficient light bulbs and white goods . "
mr scott said some utility companies took vulnerable groups , such as older people , into consideration when charging for supplies and services .
mr scott added : " when you are struggling to eat and heat your home your last priority is to go green . "
fuel poverty charity energy action scotland said there was support through schemes such as the central heating programme and warm deal for low income groups to keep their homes warm efficiently .
however , a spokeswoman said : " for people on a low income choosing to buy clothes for their children , or food , or what bill to pay means buying loft insulation is not going to be top of the list . "
" it is basically taking the country by storm and i do feel a pang of guilt not being able to do everything " mhairi davies the child poverty action group , like several other charities , said poorer families created a smaller carbon footprint - a measure of energy use and harmful emissions it is calculated to cause - than those who are better off .
a spokesman added : " there is an issue in that poor quality housing can often be quite poor in terms of energy efficiency . "
he said help was available to make home improvements , however , this was not available to everyone .
when it comes to recycling household waste there is no difference in uptake across housing types , according to waste aware scotland .
its studies of 5,002 households found 81 % recycled rubbish compared with 50 % in 2002 .
also , 75 % of households across the country now have access to kerbside recycling collections .
mhairi davies , 19 , a single mother living in inverness , said that while she made good use of the kerbside service she often felt a " pang of guilt " at not being able to afford eco-friendly shopping , such as eco-cleaning products .
ms davies , who has a four-month-old daughter bobbi-louise , said : " i think it is something i need to do rather than wanting to do it , but it 's just not possible for the amount of money i get .
" i usually go for what 's cheapest . "
she added : " i do know a lot of people who want to do more , but do n't have the means .
" it is basically taking the country by storm and i do feel a pang of guilt not being able to do everything . "
housing stock the scottish government said everyone can play a part in tackling climate change .
it said its central heating and warm deal programmes have already helped thousands of scots save energy and have warmer homes which are more affordable to heat .
a spokesman said : " the programmes have together insulated almost 260,000 homes and have resulted in improved energy efficiency across scotland 's housing stock .
" although the main aim of these programmes is to help people save on their energy bills , they have an additional benefit of helping to reduce emissions . "

the lake , nicknamed " the pearl of siberia " , is the world 's largest body of fresh water .
it is already a desirable holiday destination , in many places untouched apart from a few settlements and log cabin resorts .
the infrastructure is currently too poor to support large volumes of traffic .
but the pins on viktor grigorov 's map of baikal indicate he plans to change that .
based in the city of irkutsk , his company grand baikal is one of the investors in regional tourism and a partner company of the state electricity firm irkutsk energy .
" my conception is that there will be fast roads , hotels and spa complexes here , " he says , pointing at the map .
" at the south end of the lake i can envisage us one day hosting the winter olympics - for the first time in siberia ! "
grand baikal plans three new hotels on the west side of the lake , creating 570 jobs .
economic incentives earlier this year the russian government declared the baikal region a special economic zone , where financial laws are more liberal than in the rest of the country .
the unique ecology of the lake region is nevertheless protected by law .
the lake is home to many unique flora and fauna regional firms are capitalising on the new investment opportunity .
the popular resort of listvianka is an example , with its new market for tourists and a seven-storey hotel towering above the other buildings in the village .
hotel mayak caters for the elite .
for $ 800 -lrb- 20,540 roubles ; £ 397 -rrb- per night you can stay in the hotel 's own presidential suite .
the lake lies in buryatia , a region where unemployment is rated the worst in siberia by the united nations .
federal subsidies make up some 50 % of the republic 's budget .
most local people i met welcomed the new investment .
for the first time many have electricity in their homes .
the small town of khougir , on olkhon island , has just been wired up to the national grid .
thanks to a ready supply of cheap electricity - costing just over one rouble per kilowatt - privately run business is experiencing its own boom in khougir .
" i remember a time when ours was the only guest house on the island , but now there are more than thirty , " says natalya bencharova , who runs a travellers ' homestead with her husband nikita .
she believes the boom is having a positive impact on the local economy .
" it 's like civilisation has finally arrived , " she tells me .
the glitzy hotel mayak dwarfs traditional local buildings from a clifftop overlooking lake baikal i can see seven new hotels along the shore , their wood freshly varnished .
chainsaws whir in the sunset .
holiday camps , hunting lodges , hotels , saunas and even water-based theme parks are multiplying here .
regional energy experts expect the development around lake baikal to accelerate when more companies learn about the special economic zone .
" energy companies are aware of the importance of baikal and that it is a -lsb- unesco -rsb- world heritage site .
i think 2008 will be the year when we see noticeable investment from such companies , " says dr alexander keiko , scientific secretary of the energy systems institute in irkutsk .
environmental concerns ms bencharova takes the impact of her business seriously .
" at first i thought it was n't good to help develop tourism in this way , with many people building houses , but small-scale tourism is at least better than big hotels being put up by multinational companies , " she explains .
omul - a species unique to baikal - is a tasty local attraction across the lake , energy companies are promising to limit the impact of development .
the russian atomic energy firm rosatom is planning to construct a laboratory to monitor ecological changes caused by tourism in northern baikal .
the centre will be built in conjunction with an international uranium enrichment plant they say will allow them to invest $ 2.5bn in the region and create 2,000 jobs in the city of angarsk .
environmentalists say the impact of tourism on the delicate flora and fauna of lake baikal and its surroundings is far greater than the wealthy companies care to admit .
greenpeace and a local ngo , baikal environmental wave , have set up a partnership with other regional ecologists to evaluate the environmental impact of new tourist centres .
rubbish is already disfiguring parts of olkhon island the organiser , yana gerkova , says businessmen are purely interested in rapid investment in the region and neglect the environment .
" at a federal level , we already have plenty of strong environmental laws .
the problem is they are not enforced , " says ms gerkova , who grew up in nearby irkutsk .
litter illustrates the point .
on olkhon , cows wallow among plastic bottles , bags and tins at a rubbish dump the size of a football pitch .
" the problem is that the national park where this part of baikal is based can afford to pay only meagre salaries .
it only employs 200 people and that is not enough to keep the place clean , " says yana .
as the number of tourists rises , so too does the clean-up burden .

the russian atomic energy firm rosatom is planning to construct a laboratory to monitor ecological changes caused by tourism in northern baikal .

the lake , nicknamed " the pearl of siberia " , is the world 's largest body of fresh water .
it is already a desirable holiday destination , in many places untouched apart from a few settlements and log cabin resorts .
the infrastructure is currently too poor to support large volumes of traffic .
but the pins on viktor grigorov 's map of baikal indicate he plans to change that .
based in the city of irkutsk , his company grand baikal is one of the investors in regional tourism and a partner company of the state electricity firm irkutsk energy .
" my conception is that there will be fast roads , hotels and spa complexes here , " he says , pointing at the map .
" at the south end of the lake i can envisage us one day hosting the winter olympics - for the first time in siberia ! "
grand baikal plans three new hotels on the west side of the lake , creating 570 jobs .
economic incentives earlier this year the russian government declared the baikal region a special economic zone , where financial laws are more liberal than in the rest of the country .
the unique ecology of the lake region is nevertheless protected by law .
the lake is home to many unique flora and fauna regional firms are capitalising on the new investment opportunity .
the popular resort of listvianka is an example , with its new market for tourists and a seven-storey hotel towering above the other buildings in the village .
hotel mayak caters for the elite .
for $ 800 -lrb- 20,540 roubles ; £ 397 -rrb- per night you can stay in the hotel 's own presidential suite .
the lake lies in buryatia , a region where unemployment is rated the worst in siberia by the united nations .
federal subsidies make up some 50 % of the republic 's budget .
most local people i met welcomed the new investment .
for the first time many have electricity in their homes .
the small town of khougir , on olkhon island , has just been wired up to the national grid .
thanks to a ready supply of cheap electricity - costing just over one rouble per kilowatt - privately run business is experiencing its own boom in khougir .
" i remember a time when ours was the only guest house on the island , but now there are more than thirty , " says natalya bencharova , who runs a travellers ' homestead with her husband nikita .
she believes the boom is having a positive impact on the local economy .
" it 's like civilisation has finally arrived , " she tells me .
the glitzy hotel mayak dwarfs traditional local buildings from a clifftop overlooking lake baikal i can see seven new hotels along the shore , their wood freshly varnished .
chainsaws whir in the sunset .
holiday camps , hunting lodges , hotels , saunas and even water-based theme parks are multiplying here .
regional energy experts expect the development around lake baikal to accelerate when more companies learn about the special economic zone .
" energy companies are aware of the importance of baikal and that it is a -lsb- unesco -rsb- world heritage site .
i think 2008 will be the year when we see noticeable investment from such companies , " says dr alexander keiko , scientific secretary of the energy systems institute in irkutsk .
environmental concerns ms bencharova takes the impact of her business seriously .
