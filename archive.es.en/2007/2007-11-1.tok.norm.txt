the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.11.2007 opinion : pushing for greater awareness of india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel 's successful visit with her indian counterpart has shifted attention from china to india , giving the democracy recognition that has been long overdue . however troubled germany 's domestic political landscape might be , angela merkel has always managed to gain brownie points on the foreign policy front .
and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .
olmert lobbies west for support in sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert held talks with western powers over iran the un security council is expected to weigh new sanctions against iran later this year , although russia and china have both said they opposed further punitive steps .
olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "

israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 01.11.2007 new fingerprint passports raise privacy concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic fingerprinting is aimed at boosting security and detering forgery in response to growing terrorism concerns , germany will require fingerprints on all new passports issued as of thursday , nov .
1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .
in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .
and no line should be drawn under it , " he said . during world war ii , the german police played a prominent role in the deportation of jews and the execution of between 150,000 and 200,000 people in countries occupied by the nazis . " most of the former policemen of the nazi era managed to find a job with the police until the end of the 1950s , " ziercke said . " former members of the nazi party and former ss were able to pursue a career , including within the bka . " according to the daily süddeutsche zeitung , writer ralph giordano described wednesday 's symposium as a quantum leap in germany 's coming to terms with its past .

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .
in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .
and no line should be drawn under it , " he said . during world war ii , the german police played a prominent role in the deportation of jews and the execution of between 150,000 and 200,000 people in countries occupied by the nazis . " most of the former policemen of the nazi era managed to find a job with the police until the end of the 1950s , " ziercke said . " former members of the nazi party and former ss were able to pursue a career , including within the bka . " according to the daily süddeutsche zeitung , writer ralph giordano described wednesday 's symposium as a quantum leap in germany 's coming to terms with its past .

according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "

whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .
in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .
and no line should be drawn under it , " he said . during world war ii , the german police played a prominent role in the deportation of jews and the execution of between 150,000 and 200,000 people in countries occupied by the nazis . " most of the former policemen of the nazi era managed to find a job with the police until the end of the 1950s , " ziercke said .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .

olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "

livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "
steinmeier said that " we are not in a decisive phase , ” and he saw " great readiness " among the sides to seize " this window , this opportunity . "
asked about the upcoming conference , steinmeier said europe was willing to assist with financial help for the palestinians .
" we are offering to help .
it 's for the israelis and palestinians to tell us if they want it , " he said .
he added that a german-initiated " european action plan " to support the palestinian economy , education and security services sought to avoid wasting time and plan the allocation of donor funds in a timely and systematic manner , before the annapolis meeting and a donors ' conference scheduled for december . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is part of a broader statement : russia will not allow anyone to preach to it in terms of its internal political situation , " said maria lipman , an analyst at the carnegie moscow center , a research institution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin everywhere fyodor lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global politics , said the changes would make little difference because the political system was already weighted in favor of the ruling united russia party . " over the past two years our political system has been transformed to enable the success of one party - this is beyond the mandate of the observers , " lukyanov said . in addition to the odihr observers , russia has sent invitations to a moscow-friendly grouping of former soviet republics , and to representatives from countries including britain , france , germany , jordan and poland . authoritative body odihr is the election monitoring arm of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and is considered the most authoritative election body in eastern europe . in russia 's last parliamentary election in 2003 , about 1,200 monitors , including 399 from odihr , fanned out across russia .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party the spat over election observers comes as moscow steps up a long-running diplomatic offensive against the osce , which it accuses of bias against russian policies . russia last week said that it wanted to reduce the scope of osce observer missions , leading to accusations that the kremlin is afraid of outside scrutiny in what critics say is a rigged election process . one aspect under attack , diplomatic sources said , is the osce 's tradition of issuing a preliminary report the day after elections - a high profile occasion when journalists are given the organization 's broad-brush findings . backing russia 's bid to change osce monitoring work are armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan , all countries that have been criticized over recent elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.11.2007 opinion : pushing for greater awareness of india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel 's successful visit with her indian counterpart has shifted attention from china to india , giving the democracy recognition that has been long overdue . however troubled germany 's domestic political landscape might be , angela merkel has always managed to gain brownie points on the foreign policy front .
and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .

the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .

the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .

the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .

this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 01.11.2007 gastrointestinal insurgency could be behind toilet roll mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toilet queue soon got out of hand if it is true that an army marches on its stomach , then what better way to neutralize an enemy than to target the intestines of those who oppose you . their mission is an honorable one : to help the afghan people rebuild their lives after decades of war and to provide security to a society which has lived through years of violent instability .
the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

" it is part of a broader statement : russia will not allow anyone to preach to it in terms of its internal political situation , " said maria lipman , an analyst at the carnegie moscow center , a research institution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin everywhere fyodor lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global politics , said the changes would make little difference because the political system was already weighted in favor of the ruling united russia party . " over the past two years our political system has been transformed to enable the success of one party - this is beyond the mandate of the observers , " lukyanov said . in addition to the odihr observers , russia has sent invitations to a moscow-friendly grouping of former soviet republics , and to representatives from countries including britain , france , germany , jordan and poland . authoritative body odihr is the election monitoring arm of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and is considered the most authoritative election body in eastern europe . in russia 's last parliamentary election in 2003 , about 1,200 monitors , including 399 from odihr , fanned out across russia .
their report found the elections " failed to meet many ... commitments for democratic elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party the spat over election observers comes as moscow steps up a long-running diplomatic offensive against the osce , which it accuses of bias against russian policies . russia last week said that it wanted to reduce the scope of osce observer missions , leading to accusations that the kremlin is afraid of outside scrutiny in what critics say is a rigged election process . one aspect under attack , diplomatic sources said , is the osce 's tradition of issuing a preliminary report the day after elections - a high profile occasion when journalists are given the organization 's broad-brush findings . backing russia 's bid to change osce monitoring work are armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan , all countries that have been criticized over recent elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.11.2007 opinion : pushing for greater awareness of india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel 's successful visit with her indian counterpart has shifted attention from china to india , giving the democracy recognition that has been long overdue . however troubled germany 's domestic political landscape might be , angela merkel has always managed to gain brownie points on the foreign policy front .
and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .
seven tunisian fishermen are currently on trial in sicily , after they rescued passengers from a dinghy in distress carrying 44 migrants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .
olmert lobbies west for support in sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert held talks with western powers over iran the un security council is expected to weigh new sanctions against iran later this year , although russia and china have both said they opposed further punitive steps .
olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "
steinmeier , livni push for peace progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and livni held talks on the palestinian situation the german foreign minister then held talks with his israeli counterpart tzipi livni where the two continued discussions on the peace process .
livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "
steinmeier said that " we are not in a decisive phase , ” and he saw " great readiness " among the sides to seize " this window , this opportunity . "
asked about the upcoming conference , steinmeier said europe was willing to assist with financial help for the palestinians .
" we are offering to help .
it 's for the israelis and palestinians to tell us if they want it , " he said .
he added that a german-initiated " european action plan " to support the palestinian economy , education and security services sought to avoid wasting time and plan the allocation of donor funds in a timely and systematic manner , before the annapolis meeting and a donors ' conference scheduled for december . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 01.11.2007 new fingerprint passports raise privacy concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic fingerprinting is aimed at boosting security and detering forgery in response to growing terrorism concerns , germany will require fingerprints on all new passports issued as of thursday , nov .
1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 01.11.2007 new fingerprint passports raise privacy concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic fingerprinting is aimed at boosting security and detering forgery in response to growing terrorism concerns , germany will require fingerprints on all new passports issued as of thursday , nov .
1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .

the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .
olmert lobbies west for support in sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert held talks with western powers over iran the un security council is expected to weigh new sanctions against iran later this year , although russia and china have both said they opposed further punitive steps .
olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "

livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "
steinmeier said that " we are not in a decisive phase , ” and he saw " great readiness " among the sides to seize " this window , this opportunity . "
asked about the upcoming conference , steinmeier said europe was willing to assist with financial help for the palestinians .
" we are offering to help .
it 's for the israelis and palestinians to tell us if they want it , " he said .
he added that a german-initiated " european action plan " to support the palestinian economy , education and security services sought to avoid wasting time and plan the allocation of donor funds in a timely and systematic manner , before the annapolis meeting and a donors ' conference scheduled for december . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 01.11.2007 gastrointestinal insurgency could be behind toilet roll mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toilet queue soon got out of hand if it is true that an army marches on its stomach , then what better way to neutralize an enemy than to target the intestines of those who oppose you . their mission is an honorable one : to help the afghan people rebuild their lives after decades of war and to provide security to a society which has lived through years of violent instability .
the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .
in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .
and no line should be drawn under it , " he said . during world war ii , the german police played a prominent role in the deportation of jews and the execution of between 150,000 and 200,000 people in countries occupied by the nazis . " most of the former policemen of the nazi era managed to find a job with the police until the end of the 1950s , " ziercke said . " former members of the nazi party and former ss were able to pursue a career , including within the bka . " according to the daily süddeutsche zeitung , writer ralph giordano described wednesday 's symposium as a quantum leap in germany 's coming to terms with its past .

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .
in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .
and no line should be drawn under it , " he said . during world war ii , the german police played a prominent role in the deportation of jews and the execution of between 150,000 and 200,000 people in countries occupied by the nazis . " most of the former policemen of the nazi era managed to find a job with the police until the end of the 1950s , " ziercke said . " former members of the nazi party and former ss were able to pursue a career , including within the bka . " according to the daily süddeutsche zeitung , writer ralph giordano described wednesday 's symposium as a quantum leap in germany 's coming to terms with its past .

the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .
in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .
and no line should be drawn under it , " he said . during world war ii , the german police played a prominent role in the deportation of jews and the execution of between 150,000 and 200,000 people in countries occupied by the nazis . " most of the former policemen of the nazi era managed to find a job with the police until the end of the 1950s , " ziercke said . " former members of the nazi party and former ss were able to pursue a career , including within the bka . " according to the daily süddeutsche zeitung , writer ralph giordano described wednesday 's symposium as a quantum leap in germany 's coming to terms with its past .

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .

the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .

this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .

if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .

according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .
olmert lobbies west for support in sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert held talks with western powers over iran the un security council is expected to weigh new sanctions against iran later this year , although russia and china have both said they opposed further punitive steps .
olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "
steinmeier , livni push for peace progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and livni held talks on the palestinian situation the german foreign minister then held talks with his israeli counterpart tzipi livni where the two continued discussions on the peace process .
livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "
steinmeier said that " we are not in a decisive phase , ” and he saw " great readiness " among the sides to seize " this window , this opportunity . "
asked about the upcoming conference , steinmeier said europe was willing to assist with financial help for the palestinians .
" we are offering to help .
it 's for the israelis and palestinians to tell us if they want it , " he said .
he added that a german-initiated " european action plan " to support the palestinian economy , education and security services sought to avoid wasting time and plan the allocation of donor funds in a timely and systematic manner , before the annapolis meeting and a donors ' conference scheduled for december . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .

olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "

livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "
steinmeier said that " we are not in a decisive phase , ” and he saw " great readiness " among the sides to seize " this window , this opportunity . "
asked about the upcoming conference , steinmeier said europe was willing to assist with financial help for the palestinians .
" we are offering to help .
it 's for the israelis and palestinians to tell us if they want it , " he said .
he added that a german-initiated " european action plan " to support the palestinian economy , education and security services sought to avoid wasting time and plan the allocation of donor funds in a timely and systematic manner , before the annapolis meeting and a donors ' conference scheduled for december . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 01.11.2007 israel urges germany to support tougher iran sanctions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is concerned that iran is pursuing a nuclear capability on its doorstep israel urged germany to support further sanctions against arch foe iran 's nuclear program as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with prime minister ehud olmert in tel aviv . israel urged germany to support further sanctions against arch foe iran 's nuclear program thursday as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with prime minister ehud olmert in tel aviv .
after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .
olmert lobbies west for support in sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert held talks with western powers over iran the un security council is expected to weigh new sanctions against iran later this year , although russia and china have both said they opposed further punitive steps .
olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "
steinmeier , livni push for peace progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and livni held talks on the palestinian situation the german foreign minister then held talks with his israeli counterpart tzipi livni where the two continued discussions on the peace process .
livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "

the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 01.11.2007 gastrointestinal insurgency could be behind toilet roll mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toilet queue soon got out of hand if it is true that an army marches on its stomach , then what better way to neutralize an enemy than to target the intestines of those who oppose you . their mission is an honorable one : to help the afghan people rebuild their lives after decades of war and to provide security to a society which has lived through years of violent instability .
the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .

while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .
olmert lobbies west for support in sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert held talks with western powers over iran the un security council is expected to weigh new sanctions against iran later this year , although russia and china have both said they opposed further punitive steps .
olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "
steinmeier , livni push for peace progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and livni held talks on the palestinian situation the german foreign minister then held talks with his israeli counterpart tzipi livni where the two continued discussions on the peace process .
livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "
steinmeier said that " we are not in a decisive phase , ” and he saw " great readiness " among the sides to seize " this window , this opportunity . "
asked about the upcoming conference , steinmeier said europe was willing to assist with financial help for the palestinians .
" we are offering to help .
it 's for the israelis and palestinians to tell us if they want it , " he said .
he added that a german-initiated " european action plan " to support the palestinian economy , education and security services sought to avoid wasting time and plan the allocation of donor funds in a timely and systematic manner , before the annapolis meeting and a donors ' conference scheduled for december . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .

for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .

but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is part of a broader statement : russia will not allow anyone to preach to it in terms of its internal political situation , " said maria lipman , an analyst at the carnegie moscow center , a research institution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin everywhere fyodor lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global politics , said the changes would make little difference because the political system was already weighted in favor of the ruling united russia party . " over the past two years our political system has been transformed to enable the success of one party - this is beyond the mandate of the observers , " lukyanov said . in addition to the odihr observers , russia has sent invitations to a moscow-friendly grouping of former soviet republics , and to representatives from countries including britain , france , germany , jordan and poland . authoritative body odihr is the election monitoring arm of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and is considered the most authoritative election body in eastern europe . in russia 's last parliamentary election in 2003 , about 1,200 monitors , including 399 from odihr , fanned out across russia .
their report found the elections " failed to meet many ... commitments for democratic elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party the spat over election observers comes as moscow steps up a long-running diplomatic offensive against the osce , which it accuses of bias against russian policies . russia last week said that it wanted to reduce the scope of osce observer missions , leading to accusations that the kremlin is afraid of outside scrutiny in what critics say is a rigged election process . one aspect under attack , diplomatic sources said , is the osce 's tradition of issuing a preliminary report the day after elections - a high profile occasion when journalists are given the organization 's broad-brush findings . backing russia 's bid to change osce monitoring work are armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan , all countries that have been criticized over recent elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

" it is part of a broader statement : russia will not allow anyone to preach to it in terms of its internal political situation , " said maria lipman , an analyst at the carnegie moscow center , a research institution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin everywhere fyodor lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global politics , said the changes would make little difference because the political system was already weighted in favor of the ruling united russia party . " over the past two years our political system has been transformed to enable the success of one party - this is beyond the mandate of the observers , " lukyanov said . in addition to the odihr observers , russia has sent invitations to a moscow-friendly grouping of former soviet republics , and to representatives from countries including britain , france , germany , jordan and poland . authoritative body odihr is the election monitoring arm of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and is considered the most authoritative election body in eastern europe . in russia 's last parliamentary election in 2003 , about 1,200 monitors , including 399 from odihr , fanned out across russia .
their report found the elections " failed to meet many ... commitments for democratic elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party the spat over election observers comes as moscow steps up a long-running diplomatic offensive against the osce , which it accuses of bias against russian policies . russia last week said that it wanted to reduce the scope of osce observer missions , leading to accusations that the kremlin is afraid of outside scrutiny in what critics say is a rigged election process . one aspect under attack , diplomatic sources said , is the osce 's tradition of issuing a preliminary report the day after elections - a high profile occasion when journalists are given the organization 's broad-brush findings . backing russia 's bid to change osce monitoring work are armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan , all countries that have been criticized over recent elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 01.11.2007 gastrointestinal insurgency could be behind toilet roll mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toilet queue soon got out of hand if it is true that an army marches on its stomach , then what better way to neutralize an enemy than to target the intestines of those who oppose you . their mission is an honorable one : to help the afghan people rebuild their lives after decades of war and to provide security to a society which has lived through years of violent instability .
the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is part of a broader statement : russia will not allow anyone to preach to it in terms of its internal political situation , " said maria lipman , an analyst at the carnegie moscow center , a research institution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin everywhere fyodor lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global politics , said the changes would make little difference because the political system was already weighted in favor of the ruling united russia party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 01.11.2007 new fingerprint passports raise privacy concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic fingerprinting is aimed at boosting security and detering forgery in response to growing terrorism concerns , germany will require fingerprints on all new passports issued as of thursday , nov .
1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

after holding talks with steinmeier , olmert said that israel attached great importance to germany 's support for widening sanctions .
" the prime minister stressed the importance he ascribes to germany 's strong support of the continued expansion of sanctions against iran , " olmert 's office said in a statement following the meeting .
germany is one of six major powers involved in talks over iran 's nuclear program , which israel and the west say is aimed at developing an atomic bomb , a claim denied by tehran at a news conference after his meeting with olmert , steinmeier raised the possibility of eu sanctions against iran .
" germany 's position does not differ from that of the united states or some other european countries .
if iran refuses to provide answers , we should think about the possibility of european sanctions , " he said .
asked if germany would support further sanctions , he said , " yes , if what we are trying now is not successful , then we must not only think about sanctions , but also decide on them . "
" the right way is the -lrb- united nations -rrb- security council , " he said , but if no agreement was reached there , one would have to think about european sanctions .
olmert lobbies west for support in sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert held talks with western powers over iran the un security council is expected to weigh new sanctions against iran later this year , although russia and china have both said they opposed further punitive steps .
olmert held talks with the leaders of russia , france and britain last month in an effort to win their support for new sanctions .
israel sees the iranian nuclear issue as a prime strategic threat , partly because of iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad 's statements that the jewish state needs to be wiped off the map .
israel is widely considered to be the middle east 's sole - if undeclared - nuclear-armed nation with an estimated 200 warheads and it considers iran to be its chief enemy .
steinmeier and olmert also discussed the upcoming international meeting focusing on the israeli-palestinian issue , slated to be held in annapolis in the united states , later this month .
olmert said the meeting was an important milestone in " creating the needed umbrella to continue and to widen the existing ' peace ' process between israel and the palestinians . "
steinmeier , livni push for peace progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and livni held talks on the palestinian situation the german foreign minister then held talks with his israeli counterpart tzipi livni where the two continued discussions on the peace process .
livni denied that israel wants to drag out negotiations on palestinian statehood , saying it rejected a palestinian demand for a timetable which if not met could lead to new violence .
" israel is not interested in buying time .
that is not the case at all , " she told a news conference in tel aviv after meeting with steinmeier .
she said past experience had taught that time tables proved impossible to fulfill , and this she said , could " afterward create violence and terrorism . "
she added that she believed the palestinians , preparing for meeting at annapolis , " understand this as well . "
steinmeier said that " we are not in a decisive phase , ” and he saw " great readiness " among the sides to seize " this window , this opportunity . "
asked about the upcoming conference , steinmeier said europe was willing to assist with financial help for the palestinians .
" we are offering to help .
it 's for the israelis and palestinians to tell us if they want it , " he said .
he added that a german-initiated " european action plan " to support the palestinian economy , education and security services sought to avoid wasting time and plan the allocation of donor funds in a timely and systematic manner , before the annapolis meeting and a donors ' conference scheduled for december . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 01.11.2007 new fingerprint passports raise privacy concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic fingerprinting is aimed at boosting security and detering forgery in response to growing terrorism concerns , germany will require fingerprints on all new passports issued as of thursday , nov .
1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is part of a broader statement : russia will not allow anyone to preach to it in terms of its internal political situation , " said maria lipman , an analyst at the carnegie moscow center , a research institution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin everywhere fyodor lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global politics , said the changes would make little difference because the political system was already weighted in favor of the ruling united russia party . " over the past two years our political system has been transformed to enable the success of one party - this is beyond the mandate of the observers , " lukyanov said . in addition to the odihr observers , russia has sent invitations to a moscow-friendly grouping of former soviet republics , and to representatives from countries including britain , france , germany , jordan and poland . authoritative body odihr is the election monitoring arm of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and is considered the most authoritative election body in eastern europe . in russia 's last parliamentary election in 2003 , about 1,200 monitors , including 399 from odihr , fanned out across russia .
their report found the elections " failed to meet many ... commitments for democratic elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party the spat over election observers comes as moscow steps up a long-running diplomatic offensive against the osce , which it accuses of bias against russian policies . russia last week said that it wanted to reduce the scope of osce observer missions , leading to accusations that the kremlin is afraid of outside scrutiny in what critics say is a rigged election process . one aspect under attack , diplomatic sources said , is the osce 's tradition of issuing a preliminary report the day after elections - a high profile occasion when journalists are given the organization 's broad-brush findings . backing russia 's bid to change osce monitoring work are armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan , all countries that have been criticized over recent elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 01.11.2007 gastrointestinal insurgency could be behind toilet roll mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toilet queue soon got out of hand if it is true that an army marches on its stomach , then what better way to neutralize an enemy than to target the intestines of those who oppose you . their mission is an honorable one : to help the afghan people rebuild their lives after decades of war and to provide security to a society which has lived through years of violent instability .
the german army contingent in afghanistan undertakes its task of reconstruction under the constant threat of taliban attack , criminal activity and some of the fiercest and most diverse weather conditions in asia .
its theater of operations is often a remote and barren land where forces of nature are sometimes as deadly as the foes that lurk in the mountains and travel the plains .
for all the danger the bundeswehr troops have faced during their deployment in the north of afghanistan , none could be more unrelenting than the enemy they are now facing .
it is a stealthy opponent which strikes when least expected and one which quickly renders the victim helpless and immobile .
german troops could be falling victim to what the soldiers are calling " bagram belly " in huge numbers .
bundeswehr stomachs at risk all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fast deployment of toilet roll is well rehearsed and this new front may not confined only to afghanistan .
this new threat seems to have bundeswehr troops in its sights wherever they are stationed around the world .
a global gastrointestinal insurgency could be taking place with german soldiers as its main target .
at least this could be one reason for the 800 million toilet rolls the bundeswehr has gone through in the last 12 months .
according to a report in germany 's spiegel magazine , the 360,000 soldiers and civil workers attached to the armed forces are using an average of ten toilet rolls each a day - much to the consternation of the army 's commanders .
for those in foreign lands , like the bundeswehr 's contingent in afghanistan , it could be that the local cuisine may have been infiltrated by aggressive microbes .
insurgent microbes hiding in uncooked food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enemy could be lurking anywhere forced to survive on army rations of dried instant food , processed cheese and sausage , and bread , some soldiers may have sought sustenance in the spicy , goat-heavy stews of the hindu kush .
if so , they may have played directly into the enemy 's hands .
what 's more worrying is the widespread nature of the infiltration and the fact that it appears the bundeswehr was warned of the threat - and failed to act .
a 2003 report by the free university of berlin into the " optimization of disinfection procedures in food supply facilities of the german armed forces " revealed that a bacterial organization known as bacillus cereus had been identified as the main cause of stomach ailments and diarrhea in troops .
bacteria ignored by army chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army chiefs dismissed the possibility of a vengeful bacteria the research , however , failed to show whether b. cereus , a bacterial foodborne pathogen , had any ideological grievance towards germany and this could well have been why it was dismissed as a real threat .
while the bundeswehr desperately searches for the real reason behind the inordinately large amount of toilet paper its troops are using , the theory that a stomach bug with a grudge is responsible can not be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal boat traffic tends to peak during the warmer months , with trawlers washing up on the shores of southern europe on an almost daily basis , carrying would-be immigrants from africa .
these are the lucky ones .
all too often , the boats and their passangers are shipwrecked on the way and never arrive .
the most recent deaths occurred in southern italy , where 17 drowned at the weekend after two boats broke up whilst attempting to land .
in its latest report on border protection and human rights , the german institute for human rights has accused the eu of jeopardizing the lives of these immigrants with its border protection strategies .
one objective of the institute 's report is to clarify the human rights aspects these strategies entail .
a worsening problem with some 500 clandestine immigrants attempting to reach italy by boat in the past week alone , the united nations has warned that the number of immigrants trying to cross the mediterranean to reach europe is increasing dramatically .
this year , the unhcr estimates that over 500 boat people have drowned trying to reach europe from africa .
and given that many boats simply disappear , the figure could well be even higher .
in brussels , draft guidelines are currently being developed to make clear the obligations vis-à-vis persons encountered during interception- , search- and rescue- measures at sea .
human rights groups are increasingly concerned that the eu 's human rights obligations are being swept under the carpet .
eu fails to draw up clear rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who arrive are often traumatized " the drownings are partly the result of eu nations being unable to agree on their human rights obligations and on how to share the burden among themselves , " the institute said at the presentation of its report on wednesday , oct 31 .
this results in a lack of will to save people and diminishes the chances of those who are rescued to be treated humanely , said ruth weinzierl , one of the study 's authors .
countries such as malta , greece , italy and spain feel they are left to deal with the problem by themselves , she added .
consequently , the refugees are ignored for too long .
the watchdog accused eu countries of contravening united nations human rights conventions by intercepting boats carrying clandestine immigrants on the high seas and then accompanying them back to their ports of departure .
it said the practice was flourishing in the absence of clear rules forcing the eu to do otherwise .
" those who were saved must under all circumstances be taken to an eu country so that their situation and need for protection can be assessed , " stressed weinzierl .
" there is a lack of concrete rules obliging eu nations to bring people who are intercepted on the high seas into the eu , so that the validity of their request for refugee status can be examined , " she explained .
legal gray area a further problem cited by the institute is the fact that anyone who picks up refugees can be charged with aiding illegal immigrancy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of new arrivals never lets up crews or captains who act in accordance with the law of the sea that demands that everything possible be done to rescue vessels in distress , can face charges of assisting illegal immigration , an offence that carries a prison sentence of between one and 15 years .

1 .
the move has alarmed data-privacy activists . in a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of nov .
1 , 2007 . the electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document . the new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
by using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together . testing was positive , authorities say " security has taken a quantum leap , " matthias merx of the government printing office in berlin told the ap news service .
the printing office is issuing the new passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passports are already hard to forge , some argue authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport-holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
they are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , martin schallbruch , it director in the german interior ministry , told reporters . " the fingerprinting -lrb- in the test phase -rrb- went off without a hitch , " schallbruch said .
" the citizens were very relaxed about it . " germany is the first eu country to add the fingerprints to its passport - part of a plan put forth by the previous german government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
the plan was eventually passed as an eu guideline . opponents label move " security risk " but data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot . the chaos computer club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . " the group worries the data could be read secretly , using long-distance scanners .
it recommends carrying an electronic-chip passport in a protective envelope . but passport expert schallbruch said long-distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters . uncertainty about data files opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out - a process that can take up to six weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is now ?
scanning devices can raise privacy issues meanwhile , even schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period . but the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with berlin 's taz newspaper . still , there are still exceptions .
for instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect . " fingerprints are easy to counterfeit " furthermore , data-protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner . other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
according to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
but thilo weichert , who is in charge of data-protection for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in germany were quite small in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free the idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " there is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our german one . " frank rosengart , a spokesman for chaos computer club , agreed . " fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
his group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . " weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen . " it is a big danger in the usa and great britain .
in other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
in my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in germany as well . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .

in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .

" it is only through debate about our past that we can map out our future in a responsible way , " federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- chief jörg ziercke said in a speech on wednesday , oct 31 , at the outfit 's second symposium examining the nazi history of its founding leadership . a total of three colloquia focusing on the role of ex-nazi police officers who founded the bka in 1951 and made up the core of its leadership into the 1970s , was launched by the bka in the summer .
the agency has opened its archives to an inter-disciplinary team of renowned researchers .
the founding core of the bka included some 48 members of the nazi security forces known as the reichskriminalpolizei , or kripo .
they became part of a new criminal police force in the postwar british occupied zone , which later evolved into the bka .
according to ziercke , of the 48 , 33 had been ss leaders .
postwar history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka 's ziercke is alarmed by right-wing extremism at the end of the 1950s , nearly all of the bka leadership positions were still filled with ex-nazis or ss leaders .
according to ziercke , the police organization was rife with cliques and internal connections leading back to the nazi era that helped with re-commissioning .
the bka 's investigation aims to examine the question of whether the nazis ' notions on crime fighting were carried on after the war .
for a long time , the organization denied its nazi past .
when it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001 , the nazi era was hardly mentioned .
in december , the interior ministry told a parliamentary query on the topic : " the bka does not have a national socialist past . "
but then came the publication of a book by a former bka employee dieter schenk .
titled " the brown roots of the bka , " the book argues that the organization had been founded by active nazis .
whether the bka founders were nazis or merely careerists is something discussed in the schenk book as well as the current colloquia .
more important , according to schenk , is his belief that the political leanings of the bka founders can still be felt in its policy , " in the half-heartedness with which it has fought against the radical right , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant " elements in the country .
late , but not too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past at bka headquarters while politicians in post-war germany assumed responsibility for nazi crimes early on , other pillars of german society have been slower to confront their past .
in recent years , german businesses which spent decades rebuilding the country have been increasingly willing to delve into their histories , with companies such as publishing giant bertelsmann and dresdner bank finally coming clean on their roles in the third reich .
following in the footsteps of the foreign ministry , which established a five-man panel of historians to examine its nazi record in 2005 , the bka has now admitted to whitewashing on an institutional level . but at wednesday 's symposium , ziercke told an audience of academics and former and current members of the bka that the study was not an attempt to bury germany 's past . " no line can be drawn under the nazis ' genocide , for which the police forces of the time were partly responsible .
and no line should be drawn under it , " he said . during world war ii , the german police played a prominent role in the deportation of jews and the execution of between 150,000 and 200,000 people in countries occupied by the nazis . " most of the former policemen of the nazi era managed to find a job with the police until the end of the 1950s , " ziercke said . " former members of the nazi party and former ss were able to pursue a career , including within the bka . " according to the daily süddeutsche zeitung , writer ralph giordano described wednesday 's symposium as a quantum leap in germany 's coming to terms with its past .

and now , much to her credit , angela merkel has successfully managed to steer some of berlin 's obsessive focus on china to india - a shift that was long overdue .
but credit should also go to prime minister manmohan singh , who as economics minister in the early 1990s became known as the architect of india 's economic liberalization and who helped usher in the boom which has so impressed germany - albeit belatedly .
it was also singh who decided to treat merkel 's tour of the country as a state visit rather than a mere working trip , thereby helping make it a resounding success .
india has long deserved greater recognition for the fact that it has remained democratic for over half a century , despite being a poor country with a vast , heterogeneous population .
in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

in new delhi and mumbai , angela merkel repeatedly stressed that germany shares with india values such as a belief in human rights , rule of law and above all , democracy - values it does not necessarily share with other asian countries . indeed , china could see germany 's embracing of india as something of a snub .
merkel appears to accept that this will happen , but says it is not her intention .
problematically , india 's rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the new middle class and the impoverished bottom class , which makes up a third of the population .
a similar development has already occurred in china , but is likely to cause greater tension in a democracy - as merkel pointed out , not in front of the press but behind closed doors . obviously , angela merkel and her hosts did not agree on everything .
india and germany still do not see eye-to-eye on the world trade talks in doha , ongoing since 2001 , which is a standard problem between highly developed countries and advancing nations such as india , let alone very poor ones .
and , as the un climate change conference in bali approaches , merkel was able to make little progress on the question of climate protection .
but even talks between manhmohan singh and angela merkel on these two key global questions highlighted the two leaders ' determination to find solutions .
if the times comes that they actually do , the chancellor 's visit to india will prove in retrospect to have been even more successful .

speaking in london , sir richard dearlove said when the government made its case in parliament , too much emphasis was put on intelligence .
in reality , there were many other factors contributing to policy decisions , he said .
this turned out to have highly undesirable consequences for the intelligence community , he added .
rift rumours sir richard , the head of the intelligence service from 1999 until 2004 , made the remarks at the london school of economics .
in his lecture on intelligence and the media , he said the government felt using intelligence as the primary justification for its actions when presenting its case in parliament was the best chance of winning over its opponents .
but he went on to say the conjunction of events relating to iraq was highly unusual and unlikely to apply to issues such as iran 's nuclear programme .
in 2003 , there were reports of a rift between the government and sir richard over intelligence , but they were denied by tony blair 's government at the time .
there were also suggestions mr dearlove stood down from the post known as " c " in 2004 over the matter .
but the foreign office insisted his retirement was in no way connected to events relating to iraq .

the call comes in an annual progress report , due out next tuesday .
the report says turkey needs to do more to safeguard freedom of expression , civilian control over the military and the rights of kurds and non-muslims .
the commission will also warn eu hopefuls in the balkans they need to tackle corruption and ethnic prejudice .
the report is especially tough , according to one eu official , because for two years in a row nothing much has happened to improve fundamental rights in turkey .
the commission urges ankara to renew the momentum of political reform if it is to make progress towards eu membership in the next year .
constitutional crisis according to the report , the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression , and the country has made no progress on ensuring cultural diversity by protecting minorities such as the kurds in accordance with european standards .
it also criticises the military for commenting on issues beyond its remit .
but the report does conclude that turkey 's democracy has emerged stronger after the constitutional crisis which pitched the country 's generals against the ruling ak party , which has roots in political islam .
the european commission urges turkey to maintain good relations with its neighbours , but makes no mention of ankara 's threat to target rebel kurdish forces based in iraq .
if turkey looks many years away from achieving eu membership , so do most countries in the balkans .
croatia , which started eu membership talks along with turkey in 2005 , may join the eu by the end of the decade , but only if it speeds up the reform of its judiciary and the fight against corruption .
throughout the balkans , the report says , organised crime and ethnic tensions raise serious concern , while corruption remains entrenched and the measures being taken are not sufficient to deal with the problem .

the european commission will call on turkey to speed up political reforms if it is to make progress towards membership of the european union .
the call comes in an annual progress report , due out next tuesday .
the report says turkey needs to do more to safeguard freedom of expression , civilian control over the military and the rights of kurds and non-muslims .
the commission will also warn eu hopefuls in the balkans they need to tackle corruption and ethnic prejudice .
the report is especially tough , according to one eu official , because for two years in a row nothing much has happened to improve fundamental rights in turkey .
the commission urges ankara to renew the momentum of political reform if it is to make progress towards eu membership in the next year .
constitutional crisis according to the report , the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression , and the country has made no progress on ensuring cultural diversity by protecting minorities such as the kurds in accordance with european standards .
it also criticises the military for commenting on issues beyond its remit .
but the report does conclude that turkey 's democracy has emerged stronger after the constitutional crisis which pitched the country 's generals against the ruling ak party , which has roots in political islam .
the european commission urges turkey to maintain good relations with its neighbours , but makes no mention of ankara 's threat to target rebel kurdish forces based in iraq .
if turkey looks many years away from achieving eu membership , so do most countries in the balkans .
croatia , which started eu membership talks along with turkey in 2005 , may join the eu by the end of the decade , but only if it speeds up the reform of its judiciary and the fight against corruption .
throughout the balkans , the report says , organised crime and ethnic tensions raise serious concern , while corruption remains entrenched and the measures being taken are not sufficient to deal with the problem .

but being married to a soldier is not that easy going either , according to a ministry of defence survey .
just under 4,000 spouses of serving army , air force and navy personnel responded to a survey between february and september last year .
the survey included questions on how their lives compared with those of their non-service friends , whether married life was how they expected and their attitude to welfare services and children 's education .
with british troops stationed in iraq since 2003 and afghanistan for longer , as well as commitments around the world such as peacekeeping , families are feeling the strain , according to the survey .
" it 's getting a lot harder now , " says alison , the wife of a lieutenant colonel for 16 years .
it 's the uncertainty now which comes from the housing situation .
alison married to a lieutenant colonel with her husband about to take up another posting , her family will be making their fifth house move in four years , which included moving from canada to germany and back to the uk .
their 12-year-old son is starting his second year at boarding school - a decision he made himself - but alison will have to find a new school for their seven-year-old daughter .

i think it 's the uncertainty now which comes from the housing situation . "
in the army survey , 46 % thought their housing met their needs well or very well , as against 22 % who did not .
however , 13 % complained that their accommodation had " liveability " problems such as damp or vermin .
alison explains the family had no military housing available when they moved back to the uk , and had to find a private rental property - which the government then pays rent for .
their next posting , still in the uk , will also involve searching for private rental .

" it 's a stressful time . "
but has this stress ever driven her to persuade her husband to leave the army ?
in the army survey , 45 % of officers ' spouses and 39 % of soldiers ' spouses said they had " very often " or " often " discussed leaving the army with their spouse .
and 20 % of officers ' spouses and 15 % of soldiers ' spouses had often or occasionally put pressure on their partners to leave .
while alison has not explicitly said to her husband to leave the army , she is aware that the skills he has gained in his 21-year career could be useful in the civilian world .

" and they have been great .
there 's no denying that at all .
" my children have lived in wonderful places , met lots and lots of different people and learnt different things .
however , now the uncertainty involved with every move that you do means that it 's too much pressure now .
" although i have n't outrightly said ' this is it , this is the end of your army career ' i am encouraging him to look elsewhere now . "
the survey also suggested that one third of spouses felt their lives were " worse " than their friends who were not married to army personnel .
other findings included that 43 % of officers ' spouses and 35 % of soldiers ' wives strongly agreed that the army lifestyle limits the choices they can make .

the intense military activity of the past few years has resulted in increased calls for help from service families , said the director of welfare at the british legion , sue freeth .
in the survey nearly half , 46 % , complained that their partners were deployed on operational tours too frequently .
ms freeth said : " -lsb- we 're seeing -rsb- all sorts of different situations , such as people who have already unfortunately separated , of partners coming back and just not connecting with the family .

but being married to a soldier is not that easy going either , according to a ministry of defence survey .
just under 4,000 spouses of serving army , air force and navy personnel responded to a survey between february and september last year .
the survey included questions on how their lives compared with those of their non-service friends , whether married life was how they expected and their attitude to welfare services and children 's education .
with british troops stationed in iraq since 2003 and afghanistan for longer , as well as commitments around the world such as peacekeeping , families are feeling the strain , according to the survey .
" it 's getting a lot harder now , " says alison , the wife of a lieutenant colonel for 16 years .
it 's the uncertainty now which comes from the housing situation .
alison married to a lieutenant colonel with her husband about to take up another posting , her family will be making their fifth house move in four years , which included moving from canada to germany and back to the uk .
their 12-year-old son is starting his second year at boarding school - a decision he made himself - but alison will have to find a new school for their seven-year-old daughter .
she acknowledges that the army has always involved moving about and inconvenience - " serving soldiers ' spouses do n't mind that at all .
i think it 's the uncertainty now which comes from the housing situation . "
in the army survey , 46 % thought their housing met their needs well or very well , as against 22 % who did not .
however , 13 % complained that their accommodation had " liveability " problems such as damp or vermin .
alison explains the family had no military housing available when they moved back to the uk , and had to find a private rental property - which the government then pays rent for .
their next posting , still in the uk , will also involve searching for private rental .
but alison is not complaining about the quality of housing - private rentals are usually better than the much-maligned military housing , but she stresses it is the uncertainty .
improvements are due for army accommodation " i have seven weeks to plan a move from one end of the country to the other which is involving removal companies , a new school for my daughter and find a house that is suitable for us to live in which is close enough for where my husband is going to work .
" it 's a stressful time . "
but has this stress ever driven her to persuade her husband to leave the army ?
in the army survey , 45 % of officers ' spouses and 39 % of soldiers ' spouses said they had " very often " or " often " discussed leaving the army with their spouse .
and 20 % of officers ' spouses and 15 % of soldiers ' spouses had often or occasionally put pressure on their partners to leave .
while alison has not explicitly said to her husband to leave the army , she is aware that the skills he has gained in his 21-year career could be useful in the civilian world .
tempting offers " there are offers being put on the table from companies for people like himself and it 's very tempting . "
previously they had discussed such offers and compared them to the " life experiences " they had had as part of the army , she said .
" and they have been great .
there 's no denying that at all .
" my children have lived in wonderful places , met lots and lots of different people and learnt different things .
however , now the uncertainty involved with every move that you do means that it 's too much pressure now .
" although i have n't outrightly said ' this is it , this is the end of your army career ' i am encouraging him to look elsewhere now . "
the survey also suggested that one third of spouses felt their lives were " worse " than their friends who were not married to army personnel .
other findings included that 43 % of officers ' spouses and 35 % of soldiers ' wives strongly agreed that the army lifestyle limits the choices they can make .
the person who is serving gets all the adrenaline , the excitement and the opportunity and the training .
that 's not what the family gets sue freeth british legion among the partners of private soldiers and non-commissioned officers , almost one-in-four , 24 % , said that the experience of being married to a soldier was worse than they expected - in 3 % of cases it was much worse .
the intense military activity of the past few years has resulted in increased calls for help from service families , said the director of welfare at the british legion , sue freeth .
in the survey nearly half , 46 % , complained that their partners were deployed on operational tours too frequently .
ms freeth said : " -lsb- we 're seeing -rsb- all sorts of different situations , such as people who have already unfortunately separated , of partners coming back and just not connecting with the family .
that has an impact on people . "
she said people were prepared for the bigger sacrifices that military life can ultimately lead to , but daily life was hard for those left behind during tours .

their 12-year-old son is starting his second year at boarding school - a decision he made himself - but alison will have to find a new school for their seven-year-old daughter .
she acknowledges that the army has always involved moving about and inconvenience - " serving soldiers ' spouses do n't mind that at all .
i think it 's the uncertainty now which comes from the housing situation . "
in the army survey , 46 % thought their housing met their needs well or very well , as against 22 % who did not .
however , 13 % complained that their accommodation had " liveability " problems such as damp or vermin .
alison explains the family had no military housing available when they moved back to the uk , and had to find a private rental property - which the government then pays rent for .
their next posting , still in the uk , will also involve searching for private rental .
but alison is not complaining about the quality of housing - private rentals are usually better than the much-maligned military housing , but she stresses it is the uncertainty .
improvements are due for army accommodation " i have seven weeks to plan a move from one end of the country to the other which is involving removal companies , a new school for my daughter and find a house that is suitable for us to live in which is close enough for where my husband is going to work .
" it 's a stressful time . "
but has this stress ever driven her to persuade her husband to leave the army ?
in the army survey , 45 % of officers ' spouses and 39 % of soldiers ' spouses said they had " very often " or " often " discussed leaving the army with their spouse .
and 20 % of officers ' spouses and 15 % of soldiers ' spouses had often or occasionally put pressure on their partners to leave .
while alison has not explicitly said to her husband to leave the army , she is aware that the skills he has gained in his 21-year career could be useful in the civilian world .
tempting offers " there are offers being put on the table from companies for people like himself and it 's very tempting . "
previously they had discussed such offers and compared them to the " life experiences " they had had as part of the army , she said .
" and they have been great .
there 's no denying that at all .
" my children have lived in wonderful places , met lots and lots of different people and learnt different things .
however , now the uncertainty involved with every move that you do means that it 's too much pressure now .
" although i have n't outrightly said ' this is it , this is the end of your army career ' i am encouraging him to look elsewhere now . "
the survey also suggested that one third of spouses felt their lives were " worse " than their friends who were not married to army personnel .
other findings included that 43 % of officers ' spouses and 35 % of soldiers ' wives strongly agreed that the army lifestyle limits the choices they can make .
the person who is serving gets all the adrenaline , the excitement and the opportunity and the training .
that 's not what the family gets sue freeth british legion among the partners of private soldiers and non-commissioned officers , almost one-in-four , 24 % , said that the experience of being married to a soldier was worse than they expected - in 3 % of cases it was much worse .
the intense military activity of the past few years has resulted in increased calls for help from service families , said the director of welfare at the british legion , sue freeth .
in the survey nearly half , 46 % , complained that their partners were deployed on operational tours too frequently .
ms freeth said : " -lsb- we 're seeing -rsb- all sorts of different situations , such as people who have already unfortunately separated , of partners coming back and just not connecting with the family .
that has an impact on people . "
she said people were prepared for the bigger sacrifices that military life can ultimately lead to , but daily life was hard for those left behind during tours .
" the person who is serving gets all the adrenaline , the excitement and the opportunity and the training .
" that 's not what the family gets - the family gets the dislocation , the family often gets the long periods of not being in contact and increased pressures on daily life that all of us our getting . "
she said accommodation was a concern to people .
" if you 're actually sitting in it and not able to do anything about it and have no support to do anything about it and no-one really to talk to then you 're going to feel even more frustrated . "

when asked by american idol host ryan seacrest on his los angeles show if she was doing all she could for her children , spears said : " oh , god yeah . "
the singer is currently embroiled in a custody battle over her two young boys with ex-husband kevin federline .
" it 's sad , how cruel the world can be .
at the end of the day , you 've just got to know in your heart you 're doing the best you can , " she said .
" i try not to let it get to me , " she added , referring to recent media coverage .
unsure federline has full custody of sean preston , aged two , and one-year-old jayden james but spears is allowed three monitored visits with them a week .
in tuesday 's ruling , spears was granted two afternoons and one full night per week with her two sons .
but the pop star seemed unsure when asked by seacrest how often she would have access to them .
" that 's , like , all in the court .
stuff like that , my lawyers know all that stuff , " she said .
spears told seacrest she did not do anything special to celebrate the release of blackout , her first studio album in four years .
" we watched movies ... had fried chicken , " she said .
she said her favourite track on the album was heaven on earth .
the short telephone interview on radio station kiis-fm was ended abruptly when her assistant alli sims told seacrest that spears had left to have a shower .
detailed testimony was presented during the latest custody court ruling .
spears ' parenting coach lisa hacker concluded in her report that the singer loved her sons and that they were bonded to her .
but the report also criticised spears , calling the atmosphere at her home " chaotic " and saying she rarely played with or spoke to the boys .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- giant telescope 's double vision home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : thursday , 1 november 2007 , 09:38 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version giant telescope 's double vision by jonathan fildes science and technology reporter , bbc news the telescope has been built on the 3,200m-high mount graham almost 20 years after it was first conceived , what will become the world 's most powerful optical telescope is about to open its eyes .
lying beneath the clear skies of arizona , the $ 120m -lrb- £ 55m -rrb- large binocular telescope will allow astronomers to probe the universe further back in time and in more detail than ever before .
" the lbt is a very exciting step forward for astronomy , " said professor gerry gilmore of the institute of astronomy at the university of cambridge , uk .
" not only is it big , but it is proving the practical implementation of some of the new technologies which will be critical for all next-generation large telescopes . "
unlike most telescopes today , which consist of one light collecting mirror , the binocular telescope will consist of two 8.4m -lrb- 27.5ft -rrb- discs used in tandem .
" astronomers are looking for two things in a telescope , " explained dr john hill of the university of arizona and the technical director of lbt .
" they want a big collecting area so they can look at really faint objects far , far away ; and they want high resolution images because they want sharp images of those faint fuzzy things far , far away . "
super-sized hence , astronomers crave the largest mirrors they can get their hands on , as the larger the disc , the more light they are able to gather .
but constructing these giant reflectors is a difficult , expensive and time-consuming task .
each mirror weighs nearly 16 tonnes with present technology , the largest mirrors that can realistically be constructed are about 8m -lrb- 26ft -rrb- .
and even they come with their own difficulties .
" handling and shipping become a big problem , " said dr hill .
" already an 8.4m mirror in its box takes up two lanes of an interstate highway . "
as a result , scientists have had to come up with clever ways of maximising the potential of today 's mirrors .
one way of doing this is by using multiple reflectors in tandem .
this has been done before .
for example , the now retired multiple mirror telescope , also in arizona , contained six mirrors each with a diameter of 1.8m.
however , scientists have never tried to combine them on the scale of the lbt .
" everything about this is a first time experiment , " said dr richard green , director of the instrument .
it will work like two 8m telescopes working together to look to the very ends of the universe richard green using two mirrors will give lbt the equivalent light-gathering capacity of a single 11.8m -lrb- 39ft -rrb- instrument and the resolution of an even bigger telescope .
" it acts like a single telescope of 22.8m -lrb- 75ft -rrb- in diameter , " said dr green .
" that will give us a resolution - a sharpness on the sky - which is 10 times greater than hubble . "
the space-based hubble telescope has taken some of the clearest images yet of the universe with its 2.4m -lrb- 8ft -rrb- mirror .
sun-shade but hubble has a significant advantage over ground-based instruments .
" the bubbling and windy air in the earth 's atmosphere creates distortions and blurs the stars , " said dr green .
" we need to un-blur them in order to combine both sides and make them work like one unit . "
in graphics : lbt to do this , the telescope has two secondary bowl-shaped mirrors , each 1.6 mm thick and covered with 672 magnets on the back .
a computer analyses the light from a reference star and works out by how much the light has been distorted .
the magnets then kick into action , changing the shape of the secondary mirror 1,000 times a second to correct for the atmospheric distortions .
the secondary mirrors will be delivered in 2008 and instruments that will take advantage of this so-called adaptive optics system will be up and running the following year .
one of those will be the lbt interferometer -lrb- lbti -rrb- .
" it 's designed as what 's called a nulling interferometer that lets you reverse the phase of the light when it 's combined so you cancel the light from a bright star and look for a faint planet next to a star , " explained dr hill .
the instrument should allow astronomers an unprecedented ability to image these extrasolar planets - bodies thought to be good candidates for looking for extraterrestrial life .
the exciting thing about building a big telescope is that you never know what kind of discovery you will make john hill another interferometer will be used to create the crystal clear images astronomers want .
" what that super sharpness will allow is to look at planets and forming planet systems in nearby stars , " said dr green .
" if you can concentrate that bright star in the middle to a very small area , you can then look around it at high contrast and see the discs of dust and gas that are forming into planets . "
other researchers , he said , would focus on probing the hearts of nearby galaxies to understand supermassive black holes .
eye-opener although , scientists can not combine the image from both mirrors just yet , the flexible design of the telescope means that useful science can still be done using each mirror individually .
" first light " was achieved on 12 october 2005 enlarge image " we are already doing imaging projects for everything from looking for asteroids in our solar system to doing photometry of stars in nearby galaxies , " said dr hill .
this work is currently being done with a wide-field ultraviolet and blue spectrum camera , known as the large binocular camera -lrb- lbc -rrb- , situated above the left-hand primary mirror .
using this instrument , lbt achieved " first light " on 12 october 2005 when it imaged a spiral galaxy in the constellation of andromeda .
but lbt will not truly have arrived until it opens both of its eyes and achieves " second light " - taking images simultaneously with instruments positioned above both mirrors .
this is scheduled to happen " sometime this winter " according to dr hill when the observatory takes delivery of another lbc able to take images in the infrared .
" it will work like two 8m telescopes working together to look to the very ends of the universe , " said dr green .
science hopes dr xiaohui fan of the university of arizona is a cosmologist who is eager to work with the instrument when it is up and running .
he looks for and studies the most distant objects in the universe , at about 900 million years after the big bang .
the lightweight mirrors have an internal honeycomb structure enlarge image " it appears to be an exciting era for the universe , " he explained .
" at this time , the first generations of galaxies and quasars and black holes were forming . "
the power of lbt combined with its ability to image multiple objects at once and in multiple spectrums would allow him to search more objects , more quickly and in more detail , he said .
" my goal is to push that distance limit to even further away - to something like the first 800m years or less , " he said .
" that is where i think lbt is going to be very important . "
but others are less sure about what lbt will allow , although they are confident that it will push the boundaries of astronomy .
" the exciting thing about building a big telescope is that you never know what kind of discovery you will make , " said dr hill .
" it will probably discover things that people have n't even thought of yet . "

" handling and shipping become a big problem , " said dr hill .
" already an 8.4m mirror in its box takes up two lanes of an interstate highway . "
as a result , scientists have had to come up with clever ways of maximising the potential of today 's mirrors .
one way of doing this is by using multiple reflectors in tandem .
this has been done before .
for example , the now retired multiple mirror telescope , also in arizona , contained six mirrors each with a diameter of 1.8m.
however , scientists have never tried to combine them on the scale of the lbt .
" everything about this is a first time experiment , " said dr richard green , director of the instrument .
it will work like two 8m telescopes working together to look to the very ends of the universe richard green using two mirrors will give lbt the equivalent light-gathering capacity of a single 11.8m -lrb- 39ft -rrb- instrument and the resolution of an even bigger telescope .
" it acts like a single telescope of 22.8m -lrb- 75ft -rrb- in diameter , " said dr green .
" that will give us a resolution - a sharpness on the sky - which is 10 times greater than hubble . "
the space-based hubble telescope has taken some of the clearest images yet of the universe with its 2.4m -lrb- 8ft -rrb- mirror .
sun-shade but hubble has a significant advantage over ground-based instruments .
" the bubbling and windy air in the earth 's atmosphere creates distortions and blurs the stars , " said dr green .
" we need to un-blur them in order to combine both sides and make them work like one unit . "
in graphics : lbt to do this , the telescope has two secondary bowl-shaped mirrors , each 1.6 mm thick and covered with 672 magnets on the back .
a computer analyses the light from a reference star and works out by how much the light has been distorted .
the magnets then kick into action , changing the shape of the secondary mirror 1,000 times a second to correct for the atmospheric distortions .
the secondary mirrors will be delivered in 2008 and instruments that will take advantage of this so-called adaptive optics system will be up and running the following year .
one of those will be the lbt interferometer -lrb- lbti -rrb- .
" it 's designed as what 's called a nulling interferometer that lets you reverse the phase of the light when it 's combined so you cancel the light from a bright star and look for a faint planet next to a star , " explained dr hill .
the instrument should allow astronomers an unprecedented ability to image these extrasolar planets - bodies thought to be good candidates for looking for extraterrestrial life .
the exciting thing about building a big telescope is that you never know what kind of discovery you will make john hill another interferometer will be used to create the crystal clear images astronomers want .
" what that super sharpness will allow is to look at planets and forming planet systems in nearby stars , " said dr green .
" if you can concentrate that bright star in the middle to a very small area , you can then look around it at high contrast and see the discs of dust and gas that are forming into planets . "
other researchers , he said , would focus on probing the hearts of nearby galaxies to understand supermassive black holes .
eye-opener although , scientists can not combine the image from both mirrors just yet , the flexible design of the telescope means that useful science can still be done using each mirror individually .
" first light " was achieved on 12 october 2005 enlarge image " we are already doing imaging projects for everything from looking for asteroids in our solar system to doing photometry of stars in nearby galaxies , " said dr hill .
this work is currently being done with a wide-field ultraviolet and blue spectrum camera , known as the large binocular camera -lrb- lbc -rrb- , situated above the left-hand primary mirror .
using this instrument , lbt achieved " first light " on 12 october 2005 when it imaged a spiral galaxy in the constellation of andromeda .
but lbt will not truly have arrived until it opens both of its eyes and achieves " second light " - taking images simultaneously with instruments positioned above both mirrors .
this is scheduled to happen " sometime this winter " according to dr hill when the observatory takes delivery of another lbc able to take images in the infrared .
" it will work like two 8m telescopes working together to look to the very ends of the universe , " said dr green .
science hopes dr xiaohui fan of the university of arizona is a cosmologist who is eager to work with the instrument when it is up and running .
he looks for and studies the most distant objects in the universe , at about 900 million years after the big bang .
the lightweight mirrors have an internal honeycomb structure enlarge image " it appears to be an exciting era for the universe , " he explained .
" at this time , the first generations of galaxies and quasars and black holes were forming . "
the power of lbt combined with its ability to image multiple objects at once and in multiple spectrums would allow him to search more objects , more quickly and in more detail , he said .
" my goal is to push that distance limit to even further away - to something like the first 800m years or less , " he said .
" that is where i think lbt is going to be very important . "
but others are less sure about what lbt will allow , although they are confident that it will push the boundaries of astronomy .
" the exciting thing about building a big telescope is that you never know what kind of discovery you will make , " said dr hill .
" it will probably discover things that people have n't even thought of yet . "

lying beneath the clear skies of arizona , the $ 120m -lrb- £ 55m -rrb- large binocular telescope will allow astronomers to probe the universe further back in time and in more detail than ever before .
" the lbt is a very exciting step forward for astronomy , " said professor gerry gilmore of the institute of astronomy at the university of cambridge , uk .
" not only is it big , but it is proving the practical implementation of some of the new technologies which will be critical for all next-generation large telescopes . "
unlike most telescopes today , which consist of one light collecting mirror , the binocular telescope will consist of two 8.4m -lrb- 27.5ft -rrb- discs used in tandem .
" astronomers are looking for two things in a telescope , " explained dr john hill of the university of arizona and the technical director of lbt .
" they want a big collecting area so they can look at really faint objects far , far away ; and they want high resolution images because they want sharp images of those faint fuzzy things far , far away . "

consisting of two perfect 8.4m mirrors , the instrument will be used to look for extrasolar planets , probe the massive black holes at the centres of galaxies and look at objects forming a few hundred million years after the big bang .
the lbt has been designed to offer astronomers as much flexibility as possible .
the two large mirrors can be used separately with different instruments above each .
these are swung into position on gantries and allow different aspects of the same object to be measured simultaneously .
lbt instruments large binocular cameras above each mirror take images in the infrared and ultraviolet pepsi spectrograph will be used to understand the magnetic fields of stars mods consists of two optical spectrographs to analyse distant objects lucifer consists of two infrared spectrographs able to image multiple objects at once agw units will help track objects and correct for atmospheric distortion linc-nirvana produces wide-field , high-resolution images lbt interferometer allows detection of nearby planets obscured by bright stars telescope 's double vision however , the light from each mirror can also be combined to make one high-resolution image .
here is how it works : 1 .
as the light enters the telescope and hits the huge mirrors - the largest ever made from a single piece of glass - it is deflected towards the secondary mirrors above .
2 .
because the earth 's atmosphere distorts the light from stars , adaptive optics are used to correct the image .
moving magnets on the back of the secondary mirrors can change their shapes 1,000 times second .
3 .
the corrected light is deflected towards the centre of the telescope where one of various instruments combines the beams .
4 .
the dynamic balancing system compensates for movements of the telescope and helps it remain fixed on one spot in space .
5 .
the light can be used in different ways .
the lbt interferometer -lrb- lbti -rrb- can be used to reverse its phase , effectively cancelling the light from a bright star and allowing astronomers to look for faint , orbiting planets .
6 .
the interferometric camera is used to combine the light in phase , allowing high-resolution images to be taken .
in this mode , the telescope has the equivalent sharpness of a 22.8m -lrb- 75ft -rrb- instrument .
