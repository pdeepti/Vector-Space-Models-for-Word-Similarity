program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.03.2007 training germany 's next soccer elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander madlung , right , is one hertha youngster to have played for germany germany head into euro 2008 with loads of good youngsters .
that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .
" i watch the games to improve or to see what a certain player is doing in a given situation , " klaiber said .
" you do n't get all that caught up in it , " huck added .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .
" i watch the games to improve or to see what a certain player is doing in a given situation , " klaiber said .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .
" i watch the games to improve or to see what a certain player is doing in a given situation , " klaiber said .

dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .

" the necessary legal security now exists not only for payment service providers but also for the customers , the people in europe , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told journalists after chairing the meeting . " things are going to improve vastly for our citizens , it will be less bureaucratic , consumer protection is taken into account and there will be enormous savings for people , " he added . the plans aim to make cross-border payments by credit card , debit card , electronic bank transfer , direct debit or other means as easy , cheap and secure as payments in a single eu country . that will be done by harmonizing rules across the european union for retail payment providers who can offer such services , opening the door for non-banks such as supermarkets or mobile phone operators to muscle in on the market . plans could save consumers huge sums of money the european union is currently covered by a patchwork of national payment rules which can lead to wide variations between the prices charged for payment services . for example , a bank transfer that is free in one eu country can cost more that 10 euros in another member . the eu 's executive arm has calculated that the annual cost of making payments between these fragmented national systems is two to three percent of gross domestic product and that the shake-up could save eu consumers 50-100 billion euros per year . the plans aim to complement an industry initiative , know as the single euro payment area , to harmonize non-cash payment rules in euros starting in 2008 through a legal framework that would also cover other eu currencies . if the new rules are approved by the european parliament next month , member states would have to adopt them by november 2009 at the latest . under a compromise reached by the ministers , the rules would allow new players such as retailers or mobile phone operators to enter the payments market on condition they meet strict rules . it also allows for non-banks to provide credit across borders if it is linked to a purchase and if providers meet minimum capital requirements and repayment takes place in less than a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de socially responsible investment growing in germany unlike banks interested in maximizing clients ' returns , the community bank for loans and gifts -lrb- gls -rrb- , like several others german banks , appeals to investors ' morals and focuses on ethical and ecological investment .

" with a foreseeable increase in the number of long-distance attack missiles we should be thinking of our national security interests , " jung told the handelsblatt newspaper . beck and steinmeier - as well as much of the spd - have warned that the united states must take care not to start another arms race with russia , which has vehemently objected to an anti-missile shield in its former sphere of influence . anti-americanism not a knee-jerk reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has had more to be happy about lately than müntefering though the spd has reaped the benefits of shifting the focus to foreign policy when in a domestic crisis , including when schröder vocally opposed the iraq war and won re-election as a result , spd general secretary hubertus heil said his party should be allowed to address foreign policy issues without being accused of having a second agenda . " i think it is amazing that party tactics are always mentioned when we in the spd take a position on foreign policy , " he said in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
" sometimes the same commentators writing who sharply criticized our stance against the iraq war .
we proved to be correct . " labor minister franz müntefering -lrb- spd -rrb- said he was optimistic the social democrats would be able make it clear to voters that the grand coalition 's successes were achievements for his party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 27.03.2007 " we 're certain knut will be a big and strong polar bear " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has been an international star since his first public appearance the antics of a cuddly polar bear cub named knut at the berlin zoo continue to make headlines worldwide .
dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? -lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw .

what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .

we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .

these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the eu greatest accomplishment is keeping the peace and working together . - harold raschke-robinson why the skepticism ?
europe 50 years ago was recovering from the most devastating war in history .
now you can go from france to germany without a soldier in sight .
this is an incredible achievement and you should n't lose sight of that .
i hope you have another 50 years in peace .
the rest of the world can possibly learn something . - carl anderson , usa the eu 's greatest accomplishment over the last 50 years was uniting europeans under the eu flag and principles . - hossam el sayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks in brussels - but not everyone is celebrating i think that more than likely a common european identity is something that is probably more necessary than ever .
however , i do n't think it will be created in the next decade .
sadly enough , there is too much opposition to it since people are not willing to drop old world ideals and develop tolerance and move into the future . - stephan eu greatest accomplishment over the last half century is to create a lasting peace in europe between the combatants of world war i and world war ii .
the eu is right in sticking to the ideal that what europeans have in common is far more important than the regional differences .
keep up the good work into the future for the sake of all europeans . - darren leer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the many faces of european identity the beautiful thing about eu identity is that it allows you to maintain your national identity at the same time .
knowing that you are european gives you all the freedom to be proud of your background , which again gives you the confidence to strengthen your relations with other europeans , find similarities , learn about the differences .
national identity will probably not disappear - european and national identities are powers driving each other into a better direction .

from her first appearance on the european stage , merkel has impressed many with her ability to forge a consensus among the bloc 's leaders . while her reputation as a no-nonsense leader has helped her internationally , her christian democratic union has also scored points at home on issues that used to be the main plank of the social democratic party 's policies , including childcare , and at the same time forcing the spd to agree to a corporate tax reform . as growth approaches 3 percent and some 600,000 people have come off the unemployment rolls , many in germany are wondering who to thank for the recent upswing which economists say is likely to continue . spd making merkel look good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has a reputation for being able to forge compromises " the spd is in an existential crisis , " manfred güllner , head of the forsa research company , told reuters news service .
" merkel looks so strong right now in part because her coalition partners are so weak . " with his party at an all-time low , social democratic party leader kurt beck has taken credit for the country 's economic improvement , saying it is the belated effects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's extensive social and labor reforms that " created the conditions to put us back in the right direction . " " there is no question about it , " he told germany 's mass-market bild newspaper .
" the current economic upswing is our upswing . " but germans say they are n't convinced .
some 69 percent of germans said neither the current nor the previous government was behind the current economic recovery .
ten percent said they thought mekel 's government was behind the upswing and 14 percent said schröder 's policies were responsible , according to a forsa study conducted last week for tv news channel n-tv . the study also showed mekel to be germany 's most well-liked politician , followed by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . us missile defense separates parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coalition parties are divided on the us plans for a missile shield a controversial anti-missile shield , parts of which the united states wants to station in poland and the czech republic , is an issue the spd have been trying to use to separate themselves from the cdu . while merkel has insisted the issue be taken up by nato , defense minister franz josef jung threw his support behind the us plan on monday . " with a foreseeable increase in the number of long-distance attack missiles we should be thinking of our national security interests , " jung told the handelsblatt newspaper . beck and steinmeier - as well as much of the spd - have warned that the united states must take care not to start another arms race with russia , which has vehemently objected to an anti-missile shield in its former sphere of influence . anti-americanism not a knee-jerk reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has had more to be happy about lately than müntefering though the spd has reaped the benefits of shifting the focus to foreign policy when in a domestic crisis , including when schröder vocally opposed the iraq war and won re-election as a result , spd general secretary hubertus heil said his party should be allowed to address foreign policy issues without being accused of having a second agenda . " i think it is amazing that party tactics are always mentioned when we in the spd take a position on foreign policy , " he said in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
" sometimes the same commentators writing who sharply criticized our stance against the iraq war .
we proved to be correct . " labor minister franz müntefering -lrb- spd -rrb- said he was optimistic the social democrats would be able make it clear to voters that the grand coalition 's successes were achievements for his party . " the point now is to make social democratic ideas part of everyday political life , " he told the bild am sonntag over the weekend .

from her first appearance on the european stage , merkel has impressed many with her ability to forge a consensus among the bloc 's leaders . while her reputation as a no-nonsense leader has helped her internationally , her christian democratic union has also scored points at home on issues that used to be the main plank of the social democratic party 's policies , including childcare , and at the same time forcing the spd to agree to a corporate tax reform . as growth approaches 3 percent and some 600,000 people have come off the unemployment rolls , many in germany are wondering who to thank for the recent upswing which economists say is likely to continue . spd making merkel look good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has a reputation for being able to forge compromises " the spd is in an existential crisis , " manfred güllner , head of the forsa research company , told reuters news service .
" merkel looks so strong right now in part because her coalition partners are so weak . " with his party at an all-time low , social democratic party leader kurt beck has taken credit for the country 's economic improvement , saying it is the belated effects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's extensive social and labor reforms that " created the conditions to put us back in the right direction . " " there is no question about it , " he told germany 's mass-market bild newspaper .
" the current economic upswing is our upswing . " but germans say they are n't convinced .
some 69 percent of germans said neither the current nor the previous government was behind the current economic recovery .
ten percent said they thought mekel 's government was behind the upswing and 14 percent said schröder 's policies were responsible , according to a forsa study conducted last week for tv news channel n-tv . the study also showed mekel to be germany 's most well-liked politician , followed by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . us missile defense separates parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coalition parties are divided on the us plans for a missile shield a controversial anti-missile shield , parts of which the united states wants to station in poland and the czech republic , is an issue the spd have been trying to use to separate themselves from the cdu . while merkel has insisted the issue be taken up by nato , defense minister franz josef jung threw his support behind the us plan on monday . " with a foreseeable increase in the number of long-distance attack missiles we should be thinking of our national security interests , " jung told the handelsblatt newspaper . beck and steinmeier - as well as much of the spd - have warned that the united states must take care not to start another arms race with russia , which has vehemently objected to an anti-missile shield in its former sphere of influence . anti-americanism not a knee-jerk reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has had more to be happy about lately than müntefering though the spd has reaped the benefits of shifting the focus to foreign policy when in a domestic crisis , including when schröder vocally opposed the iraq war and won re-election as a result , spd general secretary hubertus heil said his party should be allowed to address foreign policy issues without being accused of having a second agenda . " i think it is amazing that party tactics are always mentioned when we in the spd take a position on foreign policy , " he said in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
" sometimes the same commentators writing who sharply criticized our stance against the iraq war .
we proved to be correct . " labor minister franz müntefering -lrb- spd -rrb- said he was optimistic the social democrats would be able make it clear to voters that the grand coalition 's successes were achievements for his party . " the point now is to make social democratic ideas part of everyday political life , " he told the bild am sonntag over the weekend .

from her first appearance on the european stage , merkel has impressed many with her ability to forge a consensus among the bloc 's leaders . while her reputation as a no-nonsense leader has helped her internationally , her christian democratic union has also scored points at home on issues that used to be the main plank of the social democratic party 's policies , including childcare , and at the same time forcing the spd to agree to a corporate tax reform . as growth approaches 3 percent and some 600,000 people have come off the unemployment rolls , many in germany are wondering who to thank for the recent upswing which economists say is likely to continue . spd making merkel look good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has a reputation for being able to forge compromises " the spd is in an existential crisis , " manfred güllner , head of the forsa research company , told reuters news service .
" merkel looks so strong right now in part because her coalition partners are so weak . " with his party at an all-time low , social democratic party leader kurt beck has taken credit for the country 's economic improvement , saying it is the belated effects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's extensive social and labor reforms that " created the conditions to put us back in the right direction . " " there is no question about it , " he told germany 's mass-market bild newspaper .
" the current economic upswing is our upswing . " but germans say they are n't convinced .
some 69 percent of germans said neither the current nor the previous government was behind the current economic recovery .
ten percent said they thought mekel 's government was behind the upswing and 14 percent said schröder 's policies were responsible , according to a forsa study conducted last week for tv news channel n-tv . the study also showed mekel to be germany 's most well-liked politician , followed by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . us missile defense separates parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coalition parties are divided on the us plans for a missile shield a controversial anti-missile shield , parts of which the united states wants to station in poland and the czech republic , is an issue the spd have been trying to use to separate themselves from the cdu . while merkel has insisted the issue be taken up by nato , defense minister franz josef jung threw his support behind the us plan on monday . " with a foreseeable increase in the number of long-distance attack missiles we should be thinking of our national security interests , " jung told the handelsblatt newspaper . beck and steinmeier - as well as much of the spd - have warned that the united states must take care not to start another arms race with russia , which has vehemently objected to an anti-missile shield in its former sphere of influence . anti-americanism not a knee-jerk reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has had more to be happy about lately than müntefering though the spd has reaped the benefits of shifting the focus to foreign policy when in a domestic crisis , including when schröder vocally opposed the iraq war and won re-election as a result , spd general secretary hubertus heil said his party should be allowed to address foreign policy issues without being accused of having a second agenda . " i think it is amazing that party tactics are always mentioned when we in the spd take a position on foreign policy , " he said in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
" sometimes the same commentators writing who sharply criticized our stance against the iraq war .
we proved to be correct . " labor minister franz müntefering -lrb- spd -rrb- said he was optimistic the social democrats would be able make it clear to voters that the grand coalition 's successes were achievements for his party . " the point now is to make social democratic ideas part of everyday political life , " he told the bild am sonntag over the weekend .

we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .

their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .

hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .

in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .

vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "

vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .

in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .

" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .

dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? -lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.03.2007 eu ministers agree on landmark banking reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal is expected to make cross-border banking in the eu cheaper eu finance ministers unanimously backed plans on tuesday to create a single european retail payments market to drive down costs to consumers through tougher competition . " the necessary legal security now exists not only for payment service providers but also for the customers , the people in europe , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told journalists after chairing the meeting . " things are going to improve vastly for our citizens , it will be less bureaucratic , consumer protection is taken into account and there will be enormous savings for people , " he added . the plans aim to make cross-border payments by credit card , debit card , electronic bank transfer , direct debit or other means as easy , cheap and secure as payments in a single eu country . that will be done by harmonizing rules across the european union for retail payment providers who can offer such services , opening the door for non-banks such as supermarkets or mobile phone operators to muscle in on the market . plans could save consumers huge sums of money the european union is currently covered by a patchwork of national payment rules which can lead to wide variations between the prices charged for payment services . for example , a bank transfer that is free in one eu country can cost more that 10 euros in another member . the eu 's executive arm has calculated that the annual cost of making payments between these fragmented national systems is two to three percent of gross domestic product and that the shake-up could save eu consumers 50-100 billion euros per year . the plans aim to complement an industry initiative , know as the single euro payment area , to harmonize non-cash payment rules in euros starting in 2008 through a legal framework that would also cover other eu currencies . if the new rules are approved by the european parliament next month , member states would have to adopt them by november 2009 at the latest . under a compromise reached by the ministers , the rules would allow new players such as retailers or mobile phone operators to enter the payments market on condition they meet strict rules . it also allows for non-banks to provide credit across borders if it is linked to a purchase and if providers meet minimum capital requirements and repayment takes place in less than a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de socially responsible investment growing in germany unlike banks interested in maximizing clients ' returns , the community bank for loans and gifts -lrb- gls -rrb- , like several others german banks , appeals to investors ' morals and focuses on ethical and ecological investment .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .
" i watch the games to improve or to see what a certain player is doing in a given situation , " klaiber said .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .
" i watch the games to improve or to see what a certain player is doing in a given situation , " klaiber said .
" you do n't get all that caught up in it , " huck added .

but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .
" i watch the games to improve or to see what a certain player is doing in a given situation , " klaiber said .
" you do n't get all that caught up in it , " huck added .
" i 'm more interested in seeing the mistakes and trying to draw lessons from them . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de makaay scores 100th bayern goal in win over schalke qualification for euro 2008 almost certain for germany .

" the necessary legal security now exists not only for payment service providers but also for the customers , the people in europe , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told journalists after chairing the meeting . " things are going to improve vastly for our citizens , it will be less bureaucratic , consumer protection is taken into account and there will be enormous savings for people , " he added . the plans aim to make cross-border payments by credit card , debit card , electronic bank transfer , direct debit or other means as easy , cheap and secure as payments in a single eu country . that will be done by harmonizing rules across the european union for retail payment providers who can offer such services , opening the door for non-banks such as supermarkets or mobile phone operators to muscle in on the market . plans could save consumers huge sums of money the european union is currently covered by a patchwork of national payment rules which can lead to wide variations between the prices charged for payment services . for example , a bank transfer that is free in one eu country can cost more that 10 euros in another member . the eu 's executive arm has calculated that the annual cost of making payments between these fragmented national systems is two to three percent of gross domestic product and that the shake-up could save eu consumers 50-100 billion euros per year . the plans aim to complement an industry initiative , know as the single euro payment area , to harmonize non-cash payment rules in euros starting in 2008 through a legal framework that would also cover other eu currencies . if the new rules are approved by the european parliament next month , member states would have to adopt them by november 2009 at the latest . under a compromise reached by the ministers , the rules would allow new players such as retailers or mobile phone operators to enter the payments market on condition they meet strict rules . it also allows for non-banks to provide credit across borders if it is linked to a purchase and if providers meet minimum capital requirements and repayment takes place in less than a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de socially responsible investment growing in germany unlike banks interested in maximizing clients ' returns , the community bank for loans and gifts -lrb- gls -rrb- , like several others german banks , appeals to investors ' morals and focuses on ethical and ecological investment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.03.2007 " we 're certain knut will be a big and strong polar bear " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has been an international star since his first public appearance the antics of a cuddly polar bear cub named knut at the berlin zoo continue to make headlines worldwide .
dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .

" the necessary legal security now exists not only for payment service providers but also for the customers , the people in europe , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told journalists after chairing the meeting . " things are going to improve vastly for our citizens , it will be less bureaucratic , consumer protection is taken into account and there will be enormous savings for people , " he added . the plans aim to make cross-border payments by credit card , debit card , electronic bank transfer , direct debit or other means as easy , cheap and secure as payments in a single eu country . that will be done by harmonizing rules across the european union for retail payment providers who can offer such services , opening the door for non-banks such as supermarkets or mobile phone operators to muscle in on the market . plans could save consumers huge sums of money the european union is currently covered by a patchwork of national payment rules which can lead to wide variations between the prices charged for payment services . for example , a bank transfer that is free in one eu country can cost more that 10 euros in another member . the eu 's executive arm has calculated that the annual cost of making payments between these fragmented national systems is two to three percent of gross domestic product and that the shake-up could save eu consumers 50-100 billion euros per year . the plans aim to complement an industry initiative , know as the single euro payment area , to harmonize non-cash payment rules in euros starting in 2008 through a legal framework that would also cover other eu currencies . if the new rules are approved by the european parliament next month , member states would have to adopt them by november 2009 at the latest . under a compromise reached by the ministers , the rules would allow new players such as retailers or mobile phone operators to enter the payments market on condition they meet strict rules . it also allows for non-banks to provide credit across borders if it is linked to a purchase and if providers meet minimum capital requirements and repayment takes place in less than a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de socially responsible investment growing in germany unlike banks interested in maximizing clients ' returns , the community bank for loans and gifts -lrb- gls -rrb- , like several others german banks , appeals to investors ' morals and focuses on ethical and ecological investment .

dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? -lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw .

since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? -lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the eu greatest accomplishment is keeping the peace and working together . - harold raschke-robinson why the skepticism ?
europe 50 years ago was recovering from the most devastating war in history .
now you can go from france to germany without a soldier in sight .
this is an incredible achievement and you should n't lose sight of that .
i hope you have another 50 years in peace .
the rest of the world can possibly learn something . - carl anderson , usa the eu 's greatest accomplishment over the last 50 years was uniting europeans under the eu flag and principles . - hossam el sayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks in brussels - but not everyone is celebrating i think that more than likely a common european identity is something that is probably more necessary than ever .
however , i do n't think it will be created in the next decade .
sadly enough , there is too much opposition to it since people are not willing to drop old world ideals and develop tolerance and move into the future . - stephan eu greatest accomplishment over the last half century is to create a lasting peace in europe between the combatants of world war i and world war ii .
the eu is right in sticking to the ideal that what europeans have in common is far more important than the regional differences .
keep up the good work into the future for the sake of all europeans . - darren leer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the many faces of european identity the beautiful thing about eu identity is that it allows you to maintain your national identity at the same time .
knowing that you are european gives you all the freedom to be proud of your background , which again gives you the confidence to strengthen your relations with other europeans , find similarities , learn about the differences .
national identity will probably not disappear - european and national identities are powers driving each other into a better direction .
if one goes off track , the other makes sure we keep on going . - ewa karolina wiegner , polish , now living in helsinki , finland most of what was reported from berlin at the weekend is welcome and optimistic news for the european union .
however , i for one was not entirely happy to see the ecumenical religious service broadcast on german television .
while it was certainly an impressive and lavish spectacle , the sight of all the german government ministers accepting the authority of the three church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party in berlin - should there have been a prayer as well ? leaders and then reverently bowing their heads towards the altar leaves a strong impression that the churches in germany can impose some of their agenda and succeed in obstructing the emergence of a secular europe .
surely not all the german politicians are in the grip of the churches , or are they ?
one can expect that of poland , but it 's regrettable to see a similar trend in germany . - jack becconsall i am a great admirer of german chancellor angela merkel .
she is exactly right in saying that tolerance is europe 's soul and that we must not tolerate the intolerant .
however , she is wrong to say we have christian roots .
christianity was imported from the middle east , like judaism before it .
no , like it or not , europe 's roots are pagan .
would she quote our pagan roots in a constitution ?
i think not . - roger brady , germany take religion out of the equation !
we are all human , and to communicate effectively , religion must be put aside so that communication can flow with less obstruction .
both parties need to think about how others feel and stop being selfish and juvenile .
they really are acting like children . - lynda compiled by dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?

dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .

" the necessary legal security now exists not only for payment service providers but also for the customers , the people in europe , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told journalists after chairing the meeting . " things are going to improve vastly for our citizens , it will be less bureaucratic , consumer protection is taken into account and there will be enormous savings for people , " he added . the plans aim to make cross-border payments by credit card , debit card , electronic bank transfer , direct debit or other means as easy , cheap and secure as payments in a single eu country . that will be done by harmonizing rules across the european union for retail payment providers who can offer such services , opening the door for non-banks such as supermarkets or mobile phone operators to muscle in on the market . plans could save consumers huge sums of money the european union is currently covered by a patchwork of national payment rules which can lead to wide variations between the prices charged for payment services . for example , a bank transfer that is free in one eu country can cost more that 10 euros in another member . the eu 's executive arm has calculated that the annual cost of making payments between these fragmented national systems is two to three percent of gross domestic product and that the shake-up could save eu consumers 50-100 billion euros per year . the plans aim to complement an industry initiative , know as the single euro payment area , to harmonize non-cash payment rules in euros starting in 2008 through a legal framework that would also cover other eu currencies . if the new rules are approved by the european parliament next month , member states would have to adopt them by november 2009 at the latest . under a compromise reached by the ministers , the rules would allow new players such as retailers or mobile phone operators to enter the payments market on condition they meet strict rules . it also allows for non-banks to provide credit across borders if it is linked to a purchase and if providers meet minimum capital requirements and repayment takes place in less than a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de socially responsible investment growing in germany unlike banks interested in maximizing clients ' returns , the community bank for loans and gifts -lrb- gls -rrb- , like several others german banks , appeals to investors ' morals and focuses on ethical and ecological investment .

" things are going to improve vastly for our citizens , it will be less bureaucratic , consumer protection is taken into account and there will be enormous savings for people , " he added . the plans aim to make cross-border payments by credit card , debit card , electronic bank transfer , direct debit or other means as easy , cheap and secure as payments in a single eu country . that will be done by harmonizing rules across the european union for retail payment providers who can offer such services , opening the door for non-banks such as supermarkets or mobile phone operators to muscle in on the market . plans could save consumers huge sums of money the european union is currently covered by a patchwork of national payment rules which can lead to wide variations between the prices charged for payment services . for example , a bank transfer that is free in one eu country can cost more that 10 euros in another member . the eu 's executive arm has calculated that the annual cost of making payments between these fragmented national systems is two to three percent of gross domestic product and that the shake-up could save eu consumers 50-100 billion euros per year . the plans aim to complement an industry initiative , know as the single euro payment area , to harmonize non-cash payment rules in euros starting in 2008 through a legal framework that would also cover other eu currencies . if the new rules are approved by the european parliament next month , member states would have to adopt them by november 2009 at the latest . under a compromise reached by the ministers , the rules would allow new players such as retailers or mobile phone operators to enter the payments market on condition they meet strict rules . it also allows for non-banks to provide credit across borders if it is linked to a purchase and if providers meet minimum capital requirements and repayment takes place in less than a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de socially responsible investment growing in germany unlike banks interested in maximizing clients ' returns , the community bank for loans and gifts -lrb- gls -rrb- , like several others german banks , appeals to investors ' morals and focuses on ethical and ecological investment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.03.2007 " we 're certain knut will be a big and strong polar bear " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has been an international star since his first public appearance the antics of a cuddly polar bear cub named knut at the berlin zoo continue to make headlines worldwide .
dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the eu greatest accomplishment is keeping the peace and working together . - harold raschke-robinson why the skepticism ?
europe 50 years ago was recovering from the most devastating war in history .
now you can go from france to germany without a soldier in sight .
this is an incredible achievement and you should n't lose sight of that .
i hope you have another 50 years in peace .
the rest of the world can possibly learn something . - carl anderson , usa the eu 's greatest accomplishment over the last 50 years was uniting europeans under the eu flag and principles . - hossam el sayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks in brussels - but not everyone is celebrating i think that more than likely a common european identity is something that is probably more necessary than ever .
however , i do n't think it will be created in the next decade .
sadly enough , there is too much opposition to it since people are not willing to drop old world ideals and develop tolerance and move into the future . - stephan eu greatest accomplishment over the last half century is to create a lasting peace in europe between the combatants of world war i and world war ii .
the eu is right in sticking to the ideal that what europeans have in common is far more important than the regional differences .
keep up the good work into the future for the sake of all europeans . - darren leer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the many faces of european identity the beautiful thing about eu identity is that it allows you to maintain your national identity at the same time .
knowing that you are european gives you all the freedom to be proud of your background , which again gives you the confidence to strengthen your relations with other europeans , find similarities , learn about the differences .
national identity will probably not disappear - european and national identities are powers driving each other into a better direction .
if one goes off track , the other makes sure we keep on going . - ewa karolina wiegner , polish , now living in helsinki , finland most of what was reported from berlin at the weekend is welcome and optimistic news for the european union .
however , i for one was not entirely happy to see the ecumenical religious service broadcast on german television .
while it was certainly an impressive and lavish spectacle , the sight of all the german government ministers accepting the authority of the three church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party in berlin - should there have been a prayer as well ? leaders and then reverently bowing their heads towards the altar leaves a strong impression that the churches in germany can impose some of their agenda and succeed in obstructing the emergence of a secular europe .
surely not all the german politicians are in the grip of the churches , or are they ?
one can expect that of poland , but it 's regrettable to see a similar trend in germany . - jack becconsall i am a great admirer of german chancellor angela merkel .
she is exactly right in saying that tolerance is europe 's soul and that we must not tolerate the intolerant .
however , she is wrong to say we have christian roots .
christianity was imported from the middle east , like judaism before it .
no , like it or not , europe 's roots are pagan .
would she quote our pagan roots in a constitution ?
i think not . - roger brady , germany take religion out of the equation !
we are all human , and to communicate effectively , religion must be put aside so that communication can flow with less obstruction .
both parties need to think about how others feel and stop being selfish and juvenile .
they really are acting like children . - lynda compiled by dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?
it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification .
-lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- the day the eu was born on march 25 , 1957 , representatives of the six founding countries met in the italian capital to sign the treaties of rome , the cornerstone documents of what would become the european union .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- europeans speak out on european identity they 're french or finish , estonian or portuguese , but do europeans also feel european ?
dw-world.de spoke with a handful of people with international backgrounds about their own european identity .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- not yet in full bloom , but a european identity is growing europeans are both citizens of their own countries , and citizens of a european supranational union , the eu .
which do they feel a real part of ?
surveys show increasing numbers feel allegiance to both .

sadly enough , there is too much opposition to it since people are not willing to drop old world ideals and develop tolerance and move into the future . - stephan eu greatest accomplishment over the last half century is to create a lasting peace in europe between the combatants of world war i and world war ii .
the eu is right in sticking to the ideal that what europeans have in common is far more important than the regional differences .
keep up the good work into the future for the sake of all europeans . - darren leer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the many faces of european identity the beautiful thing about eu identity is that it allows you to maintain your national identity at the same time .
knowing that you are european gives you all the freedom to be proud of your background , which again gives you the confidence to strengthen your relations with other europeans , find similarities , learn about the differences .
national identity will probably not disappear - european and national identities are powers driving each other into a better direction .
if one goes off track , the other makes sure we keep on going . - ewa karolina wiegner , polish , now living in helsinki , finland most of what was reported from berlin at the weekend is welcome and optimistic news for the european union .
however , i for one was not entirely happy to see the ecumenical religious service broadcast on german television .
while it was certainly an impressive and lavish spectacle , the sight of all the german government ministers accepting the authority of the three church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party in berlin - should there have been a prayer as well ? leaders and then reverently bowing their heads towards the altar leaves a strong impression that the churches in germany can impose some of their agenda and succeed in obstructing the emergence of a secular europe .
surely not all the german politicians are in the grip of the churches , or are they ?
one can expect that of poland , but it 's regrettable to see a similar trend in germany . - jack becconsall i am a great admirer of german chancellor angela merkel .
she is exactly right in saying that tolerance is europe 's soul and that we must not tolerate the intolerant .
however , she is wrong to say we have christian roots .
christianity was imported from the middle east , like judaism before it .
no , like it or not , europe 's roots are pagan .
would she quote our pagan roots in a constitution ?
i think not . - roger brady , germany take religion out of the equation !
we are all human , and to communicate effectively , religion must be put aside so that communication can flow with less obstruction .
both parties need to think about how others feel and stop being selfish and juvenile .
they really are acting like children . - lynda compiled by dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?
it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification .

dw-world.de spoke with a handful of people with international backgrounds about their own european identity .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- not yet in full bloom , but a european identity is growing europeans are both citizens of their own countries , and citizens of a european supranational union , the eu .

dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .

dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? -lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw .

europe 50 years ago was recovering from the most devastating war in history .
now you can go from france to germany without a soldier in sight .
this is an incredible achievement and you should n't lose sight of that .
i hope you have another 50 years in peace .
the rest of the world can possibly learn something . - carl anderson , usa the eu 's greatest accomplishment over the last 50 years was uniting europeans under the eu flag and principles . - hossam el sayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks in brussels - but not everyone is celebrating i think that more than likely a common european identity is something that is probably more necessary than ever .
however , i do n't think it will be created in the next decade .
sadly enough , there is too much opposition to it since people are not willing to drop old world ideals and develop tolerance and move into the future . - stephan eu greatest accomplishment over the last half century is to create a lasting peace in europe between the combatants of world war i and world war ii .
the eu is right in sticking to the ideal that what europeans have in common is far more important than the regional differences .
keep up the good work into the future for the sake of all europeans . - darren leer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the many faces of european identity the beautiful thing about eu identity is that it allows you to maintain your national identity at the same time .
knowing that you are european gives you all the freedom to be proud of your background , which again gives you the confidence to strengthen your relations with other europeans , find similarities , learn about the differences .
national identity will probably not disappear - european and national identities are powers driving each other into a better direction .

one can expect that of poland , but it 's regrettable to see a similar trend in germany . - jack becconsall i am a great admirer of german chancellor angela merkel .
she is exactly right in saying that tolerance is europe 's soul and that we must not tolerate the intolerant .
however , she is wrong to say we have christian roots .
christianity was imported from the middle east , like judaism before it .
no , like it or not , europe 's roots are pagan .
would she quote our pagan roots in a constitution ?
i think not . - roger brady , germany take religion out of the equation !

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .

frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .

vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "

vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .

vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 27.03.2007 readers respond to 50 years of european unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been 50 years since the signing of the treaty of rome europe was on readers ' minds this week , as they weighed in on the eu 's fiftieth birthday in berlin , european identity and the role of religion in eu constitution . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the eu greatest accomplishment is keeping the peace and working together . - harold raschke-robinson why the skepticism ?
europe 50 years ago was recovering from the most devastating war in history .
now you can go from france to germany without a soldier in sight .
this is an incredible achievement and you should n't lose sight of that .
i hope you have another 50 years in peace .
the rest of the world can possibly learn something . - carl anderson , usa the eu 's greatest accomplishment over the last 50 years was uniting europeans under the eu flag and principles . - hossam el sayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks in brussels - but not everyone is celebrating i think that more than likely a common european identity is something that is probably more necessary than ever .
however , i do n't think it will be created in the next decade .
sadly enough , there is too much opposition to it since people are not willing to drop old world ideals and develop tolerance and move into the future . - stephan eu greatest accomplishment over the last half century is to create a lasting peace in europe between the combatants of world war i and world war ii .
the eu is right in sticking to the ideal that what europeans have in common is far more important than the regional differences .
keep up the good work into the future for the sake of all europeans . - darren leer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the many faces of european identity the beautiful thing about eu identity is that it allows you to maintain your national identity at the same time .
knowing that you are european gives you all the freedom to be proud of your background , which again gives you the confidence to strengthen your relations with other europeans , find similarities , learn about the differences .
national identity will probably not disappear - european and national identities are powers driving each other into a better direction .
if one goes off track , the other makes sure we keep on going . - ewa karolina wiegner , polish , now living in helsinki , finland most of what was reported from berlin at the weekend is welcome and optimistic news for the european union .
however , i for one was not entirely happy to see the ecumenical religious service broadcast on german television .
while it was certainly an impressive and lavish spectacle , the sight of all the german government ministers accepting the authority of the three church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party in berlin - should there have been a prayer as well ? leaders and then reverently bowing their heads towards the altar leaves a strong impression that the churches in germany can impose some of their agenda and succeed in obstructing the emergence of a secular europe .
surely not all the german politicians are in the grip of the churches , or are they ?
one can expect that of poland , but it 's regrettable to see a similar trend in germany . - jack becconsall i am a great admirer of german chancellor angela merkel .
she is exactly right in saying that tolerance is europe 's soul and that we must not tolerate the intolerant .
however , she is wrong to say we have christian roots .
christianity was imported from the middle east , like judaism before it .
no , like it or not , europe 's roots are pagan .
would she quote our pagan roots in a constitution ?
i think not . - roger brady , germany take religion out of the equation !
we are all human , and to communicate effectively , religion must be put aside so that communication can flow with less obstruction .
both parties need to think about how others feel and stop being selfish and juvenile .
they really are acting like children . - lynda compiled by dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?
it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification .
-lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- the day the eu was born on march 25 , 1957 , representatives of the six founding countries met in the italian capital to sign the treaties of rome , the cornerstone documents of what would become the european union .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- europeans speak out on european identity they 're french or finish , estonian or portuguese , but do europeans also feel european ?
dw-world.de spoke with a handful of people with international backgrounds about their own european identity .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- not yet in full bloom , but a european identity is growing europeans are both citizens of their own countries , and citizens of a european supranational union , the eu .
which do they feel a real part of ?
surveys show increasing numbers feel allegiance to both .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.03.2007 training germany 's next soccer elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander madlung , right , is one hertha youngster to have played for germany germany head into euro 2008 with loads of good youngsters .
that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .

what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .

dw-world.de spoke to his veterinarian andré schüle about the knut cult and the bear 's future . bildunterschrift : knut has a happy roll in the sand at berlin 's zoo dw-world.de : the knut hype is enormous .
domestic and foreign media are reporting about the little polar bear daily .
star photographer annie leibowitz flew in from new york for a shoot and italian leader romano prodi left the festivities marking the eu 's 50th birthday early in order to visit knut at the zoo .
now , there 's even knut-tv .
what do you think about all the hype ? andré schüle : we 're happy that we can finally show knut to the public after we kept him secluded on the bear grounds for a long time .
we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.03.2007 training germany 's next soccer elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander madlung , right , is one hertha youngster to have played for germany germany head into euro 2008 with loads of good youngsters .
that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .

that 's because bundesliga clubs have been forced to invest more in player development .
but how does a youth program work ?
we visited hertha berlin to find out . the situation faced by hertha berlin is typical of a lot of bundesliga clubs .
burdened by some 46 million euros -lrb- $ 59 million -rrb- in debt , the club ca n't afford to pay huge transfer fees and has to develop talent from within its own ranks .
twelve of the 27 players currently on hertha 's professional roster came from the club 's own youth divisions .
robert huck , 19 , and christoph klaiber , 17 , are only just beginning to crack hertha 's third-division developmental side .
but they 're still setting their sights high .
interrupting a horror movie they had been watching in the recreation room at hertha 's live-in soccer academy , they talked about every player 's ultimate dream – to win a cap in his national squad .
" definitely , " said huck .
" if you 've just experienced a world cup , especially in your own country , you really want to play for the national side . "
" i think for everyone there 's nothing better than playing for your country , " added klaiber , nodding dreamily .
7 0,000 kilometers a year bildunterschrift : hertha 's under-11 team is one of a number of developmental squads huck and klaiber are just two of around 200 young athletes dreaming of a career at hertha or beyond .
frank vogel , the chief coordinator of the club 's youth program , explained how he goes about finding young talent .
scouting begins with little kids kicking the ball about in school competitions .
members of vogel 's staff , often unpaid volunteers , begin tracking players as young as seven years old in the german capital .
the best are invited to join hertha 's youth teams .
with every step in age - for example from under-8 to under-9 - the club broadens its focus and increases the competition among the youngsters for a spot in the squad .
at age level 15 , hertha begins scouting nationally and internationally .
exceptional talents from outside berlin are offered one of 18 places in the club 's soccer academy .
they live together along a long corridor at the team 's administrative and training facility - a stone 's throw away from berlin 's olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank vogel used to be hertha 's amateur coach - now he runs the club 's youth program hertha spends between 4 and 4.5 million euros a year , roughly a fifth of the sum it pays in salaries for the professionals , to scout and train potential stars .
vogel himself logs around 70,000 kilometers per annum to check out promising players .
investments in time and money are necessary in order for clubs to compete in the bundesliga .
" for a number of years , all the clubs have been forced to do more in this area , " vogel told dw-world.de. " and i think that 's one reason why the quality of young german players has gotten better as they make their way to the bundesliga . "
long days , hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : midfielder kevin prince boateng -lrb- left -rrb- is another candidate for germany aspiring talents do n't have much time to get into the usual adolescent mischief .
pupils at the academy have eight practice sessions a week in addition to their education at one of two special schools oriented toward the needs of elite young athletes .
their days begin at 8 a.m. and end sometime after 7:30 p.m. – depending on when they complete their homework .
there are matches almost every weekend as well as visits to the stadium to watch the pros in action .
academy residents are supervised by a live-in married couple , and each youngster is assigned a " godfather " from hertha 's professional team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha defender joe simunic -lrb- right -rrb- shoots some pool with his " godchild , " hertha u-19 captain rico morack the results for those who survive the intense competition are impressive .
hertha 's squad is full of home-grown young talents : attacking midfielders like kevin prince boateng , chinedu ede , and patrick ebert , or defensive specialists like christopher schorsch , sofian chahed and jerome boateng .
vogel thinks they all have a shot at playing for germany some day .
" if they develop consistency , do n't get injured and possess that special personal drive to become a top bundesliga player , one or two of them will certainly get the chance to play for the national side at one of the big events , " vogel said .
evidence of such potential is taped to the walls of vogel 's office in the form of newspaper clippings featuring defenders malik fahti and alexander madlung -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- , both of whom won national caps after coming through hertha 's youth program .
vogel , a burly , no-nonsense sort of guy in his mid-forties , looks as though he won a fair share of challenges in his day .
yet staring at the clippings , one ca n't help be reminded of the pictures of soccer heroes with which star-struck young boys decorate their rooms .
change in emphasis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at hertha 's soccer academy get their rooms for free , replete with team-logo bedding bundesliga budget constraints are good for the german national team .
a decade ago , schalke and dortmund were winning international club competitions , and germany was crashing out early in the world cup and the european championships .
in 2007 , schalke are long gone from the uefa cup and dortmund are fighting relegation , but germany enter next year 's euro 2008 in switzerland and austria as one of the favorites .
that 's because clubs have changed their emphasis .
" like stuttgart before them , hertha have made a virtue of financial necessity by investing in their own youth program instead of spending millions on foreigners , " said rainer holzschuch , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer magazine , kicker .
" and because dortmund , frankfurt and nuremberg have had to follow suit , there is a lot of young talent on the verge of making the national team . "
germany is not only producing more talent .
it 's also cultivating players with a professional attitude toward the game at a young age .
robert huck and christoph klaiber , for example , do n't experience hertha 's professional matches like ordinary fans , caught up in the tide of emotions .
" i watch the games to improve or to see what a certain player is doing in a given situation , " klaiber said .

we 're proud that so many visitors are coming and want to take pictures .
above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "

above all , we 're happy that knut is so healthy and fit that he can make an appearance everyday . how do you explain the knut cult ?
what makes a little polar bear such a special attraction ? for one , knut perfectly embodies typical childlike characteristics : a round head , high forehead , a snub nose like a black button on a white background , fluffy ears - everything that brings out people 's protective instincts and triggers this feeling of " i like you . "
but it 's also the fact that normally , polar bears that are raised by their mothers can only be seen outside of their cave when they 're three to four months at the earliest .
since we hand fed knut , we could show photos of a polar bear baby that is still very little . have you ever experienced a similar media uproar in your other work as a veterinarian ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even steiff has brought out a knut bear with respect to the media interest in knut : no one in our zoo team has ever experienced this to date , with no animal . are the other patients even still interesting for you ? of course .
we have 14,000 animals here and every one of them is equally important and of equal distinctiveness .
knut is now no longer so much a patient .
initially , we had to check on him frequently .
now , we just follow his development .
we take note of how much weight he gains and how much he eats .
these things are of course exciting for us and of interest .
but we still have enough time for all of the other animals . what do knut 's patient records look like - thick or thin ? it 's very thin .
at the beginning , there were phases in which he had bouts of fever and was n't fully stable , just like babies do .
meanwhile , we veterinarians actually just write down his meals .
his weight is registered once a day and his body temperature measured .
knut has been stable and healthy for a long time . how long does such an orphan upbringing in captivity take ? the keepers will handle knut for about another year .
then , he 'll probably choose a path without human contact .
we 'll continue to tend to him and care for him from a distance , just like we do with the other bears in our zoo . bildunterschrift : keeper thomas dörflein has been caring for knut since he was born in december 2006 some animal-rights activists have said in the past weeks that the orphan upbringing of bears in captivity is inhumane .
what do you think about such comments ? no zoo that has had the opportunity to raise such a healthy polar bear baby with hand feeding would have chosen otherwise .
these so-called animal-rights activists are luckily a minority . what happens when knut grows up ?
he 's not always going to remain so little and cuddly . we 're fairly certain that knut will become a big and strong polar bear male .
other zoos are already lining up now to get him as a future breeding bear .
we have knut 's father , lars , as a breeding bear here in our zoo .
he has proven that he does a good job .
but you ca n't keep two male polar bears together on the same grounds .
so when knut is full-grown and faces his sexual maturity , we will make an effort to find a suitable zoo where knut will have the opportunity to live with female polar bears and found a breeding group . angela lieber interviewed andré schüle -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's other bear returns to prominence in diplomatic row while little knut continues to grab all the headlines for being alive against the odds , one not-so-lucky member of his brethren is set to make a return to the front pages , this time at the center of a diplomatic row .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? -lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .

from her first appearance on the european stage , merkel has impressed many with her ability to forge a consensus among the bloc 's leaders . while her reputation as a no-nonsense leader has helped her internationally , her christian democratic union has also scored points at home on issues that used to be the main plank of the social democratic party 's policies , including childcare , and at the same time forcing the spd to agree to a corporate tax reform . as growth approaches 3 percent and some 600,000 people have come off the unemployment rolls , many in germany are wondering who to thank for the recent upswing which economists say is likely to continue . spd making merkel look good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has a reputation for being able to forge compromises " the spd is in an existential crisis , " manfred güllner , head of the forsa research company , told reuters news service .
" merkel looks so strong right now in part because her coalition partners are so weak . " with his party at an all-time low , social democratic party leader kurt beck has taken credit for the country 's economic improvement , saying it is the belated effects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's extensive social and labor reforms that " created the conditions to put us back in the right direction .

from her first appearance on the european stage , merkel has impressed many with her ability to forge a consensus among the bloc 's leaders . while her reputation as a no-nonsense leader has helped her internationally , her christian democratic union has also scored points at home on issues that used to be the main plank of the social democratic party 's policies , including childcare , and at the same time forcing the spd to agree to a corporate tax reform . as growth approaches 3 percent and some 600,000 people have come off the unemployment rolls , many in germany are wondering who to thank for the recent upswing which economists say is likely to continue . spd making merkel look good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has a reputation for being able to forge compromises " the spd is in an existential crisis , " manfred güllner , head of the forsa research company , told reuters news service .
" merkel looks so strong right now in part because her coalition partners are so weak . " with his party at an all-time low , social democratic party leader kurt beck has taken credit for the country 's economic improvement , saying it is the belated effects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's extensive social and labor reforms that " created the conditions to put us back in the right direction .

" the current economic upswing is our upswing . " but germans say they are n't convinced .
some 69 percent of germans said neither the current nor the previous government was behind the current economic recovery .
ten percent said they thought mekel 's government was behind the upswing and 14 percent said schröder 's policies were responsible , according to a forsa study conducted last week for tv news channel n-tv . the study also showed mekel to be germany 's most well-liked politician , followed by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . us missile defense separates parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coalition parties are divided on the us plans for a missile shield a controversial anti-missile shield , parts of which the united states wants to station in poland and the czech republic , is an issue the spd have been trying to use to separate themselves from the cdu . while merkel has insisted the issue be taken up by nato , defense minister franz josef jung threw his support behind the us plan on monday .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the eu greatest accomplishment is keeping the peace and working together . - harold raschke-robinson why the skepticism ?
europe 50 years ago was recovering from the most devastating war in history .
now you can go from france to germany without a soldier in sight .
this is an incredible achievement and you should n't lose sight of that .
i hope you have another 50 years in peace .
the rest of the world can possibly learn something . - carl anderson , usa the eu 's greatest accomplishment over the last 50 years was uniting europeans under the eu flag and principles . - hossam el sayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks in brussels - but not everyone is celebrating i think that more than likely a common european identity is something that is probably more necessary than ever .
however , i do n't think it will be created in the next decade .
sadly enough , there is too much opposition to it since people are not willing to drop old world ideals and develop tolerance and move into the future . - stephan eu greatest accomplishment over the last half century is to create a lasting peace in europe between the combatants of world war i and world war ii .
the eu is right in sticking to the ideal that what europeans have in common is far more important than the regional differences .
keep up the good work into the future for the sake of all europeans . - darren leer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the many faces of european identity the beautiful thing about eu identity is that it allows you to maintain your national identity at the same time .
knowing that you are european gives you all the freedom to be proud of your background , which again gives you the confidence to strengthen your relations with other europeans , find similarities , learn about the differences .
national identity will probably not disappear - european and national identities are powers driving each other into a better direction .
if one goes off track , the other makes sure we keep on going . - ewa karolina wiegner , polish , now living in helsinki , finland most of what was reported from berlin at the weekend is welcome and optimistic news for the european union .
however , i for one was not entirely happy to see the ecumenical religious service broadcast on german television .
while it was certainly an impressive and lavish spectacle , the sight of all the german government ministers accepting the authority of the three church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party in berlin - should there have been a prayer as well ? leaders and then reverently bowing their heads towards the altar leaves a strong impression that the churches in germany can impose some of their agenda and succeed in obstructing the emergence of a secular europe .
surely not all the german politicians are in the grip of the churches , or are they ?
one can expect that of poland , but it 's regrettable to see a similar trend in germany . - jack becconsall i am a great admirer of german chancellor angela merkel .
she is exactly right in saying that tolerance is europe 's soul and that we must not tolerate the intolerant .
however , she is wrong to say we have christian roots .
christianity was imported from the middle east , like judaism before it .
no , like it or not , europe 's roots are pagan .
would she quote our pagan roots in a constitution ?
i think not . - roger brady , germany take religion out of the equation !
we are all human , and to communicate effectively , religion must be put aside so that communication can flow with less obstruction .
both parties need to think about how others feel and stop being selfish and juvenile .
they really are acting like children . - lynda compiled by dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?
it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification .
-lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- the day the eu was born on march 25 , 1957 , representatives of the six founding countries met in the italian capital to sign the treaties of rome , the cornerstone documents of what would become the european union .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- europeans speak out on european identity they 're french or finish , estonian or portuguese , but do europeans also feel european ?
dw-world.de spoke with a handful of people with international backgrounds about their own european identity .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- not yet in full bloom , but a european identity is growing europeans are both citizens of their own countries , and citizens of a european supranational union , the eu .
which do they feel a real part of ?
surveys show increasing numbers feel allegiance to both .

unity mine at cwmgwrach , in the neath valley , is due to begin production within weeks , taking on 60 workers .
owners of a nearby mine at aberpergwm say they are close to accessing a large coal reserve , meaning up to 200 more workers will be needed .
unity chairman gerwyn williams said he planned to open more mines in south wales to meet europe 's " energy gap " .
final preparations at unity mine are taking place ahead of the beginning of production in june .
mine owner unity power said it plans to increase production to one million tonnes of coal a year .
currently , the only deep mine operating on the once-thriving south wales coalfield is tower colliery , near hirwaun , which has been run by its workers since 1995 .
tower is due to close early next year though , because its reserves are exhausted .
gerwyn williams said he believed the new pit would be viable no new deep mine has opened in south wales since betws colliery near ammanford in 1974 .
gerwyn williams told bbc wales ' week in week out programme he was confident the new mine was viable , adding it could herald the opening of four further pits by his company across south wales .
he said : " in seven or eight years a lot of things have changed .
the price of coal has gone up and europe is faced with an energy gap .
" we do n't think that renewables are going to meet the gap that we 've got , so everybody will come back to coal . "
tyrone o 'sullivan , chairman of tower colliery , said the possibility of new mines opening was an opportunity to prevent the skills of wales ' miners from being lost .
he said : " if somebody had said to me , when it comes to the end of tower , there will be a brand new pit , ready to be developed , i would say they were dreaming .
" but that 's exactly how it 's going to happen , and i think it 's an exciting time for wales . "
but mr williams , of unity power , warned he may have to recruit foreign workers , possibly polish , because of the lack of miners remaining in wales .
there have been no deep mines opened in wales since the 1970s he said : " i do n't know where we are going to get them - we ca n't just click our fingers .
" there are mining men all over the world that want to come to the uk to work and while we want to employ local people i 'm afraid that there is going to be a period where we are going to have to bring in skills from overseas . "
as well as unity mine , a neighbouring pit is preparing to access what is believed to be the biggest reserve of anthracite in europe .
energy build holdings said it was within 500 metres -lrb- 1,640ft -rrb- of a 9ft -lrb- 2.7m -rrb- seam of coal at aberpergwm after a decade of development work .
company spokesman rhidian davies said the mine had great potential .
" there 's more than enough coal there to keep me in work and many others for 40 to 50 years " , he added .
" the potential here is vast , there 's many millions of tonnes there . "

scientists say they have come up with a way of making pizzas more healthy .
us researchers have developed a way of baking and fermenting dough which can increase levels of antioxidants , which protect against cell and tissue damage .
the team from the university of maryland told the american chemical society longer baking and higher temperatures are the key .
but a uk diet expert said a healthier pizza base might lead people to choose more unhealthy toppings .
chemical reactions the researchers looked at the effect of different baking conditions on the dough .
i would rather people ate their five portions of fruit and vegetables each day , than ate more pizza jacqui lowdon , british dietetic association they cooked two different kinds of whole grain pizza dough , made from two different varieties of wheat , at a range of temperatures from 204c to 285c , and to different baking times - from seven to 14 minutes .
the dough was also checked for its antioxidant properties .
antioxidant levels increased by up to 60 % during longer baking times and by as much as 82 % during higher baking temperatures , depending on the type of wheat flour and the antioxidant test used , the researcher says .
letting the pizza dough ferment for longer , up to 48 hours , also appeared to increase antioxidants significantly , the researchers found .
it is thought chemical reactions induced by yeasts might explain the increased levels .
the researchers suggest longer baking time , higher temperature and longer fermentation will also boost antioxidant levels in refined pizza dough , though to a lesser degree .
jeffrey moore , who led the study , said the findings could be particularly good for people who like deep-pan pizzas which " may have the potential to deliver higher levels of antioxidants in comparison to other pizza styles . "
the research was funded by grain producing organisations , but received no money from the pizza industry .
but jacqui lowdon of the british dietetic association said : " i would rather people ate their five portions of fruit and vegetables each day , than ate more pizza .
" they will be getting a high fat intake , and it may make them more likely to choose extra cheese and salami .

the dough was also checked for its antioxidant properties .
antioxidant levels increased by up to 60 % during longer baking times and by as much as 82 % during higher baking temperatures , depending on the type of wheat flour and the antioxidant test used , the researcher says .

the researchers suggest longer baking time , higher temperature and longer fermentation will also boost antioxidant levels in refined pizza dough , though to a lesser degree .

last updated : tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:37 gmt 08:37 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the world of modern child slavery by rageh omaar presenter of bbc two documentary child slavery slavery is a word which immediately conjures up very specific images in our minds .
rageh omaar tries to discover the realities about child slavery programme preview when it is mentioned we tend to think of people , almost always black people ; degraded , abused and bound in chains , and we tend to think of such images , and the word slavery itself , as belonging to another era .
we do not see slavery as belonging to our world , not as something which is still happening today .
yet the truth is that if william wilberforce were alive today and he travelled to different parts of the world - not just in africa , but also in large parts of asia , the middle east , south america and even parts of europe - he would find children living in conditions and circumstances which wilberforce would understand and which i am sure he would describe as slavery .
it is believed there are nearly nine million children around the world today who are enslaved .
there are international charters and covenants which try to come to a legal definition of what constitutes slavery .
in essence these documents define slavery in the modern world as a situation where a human being and their labour are owned by others , and where that person does not have the freedom to leave and is forced into a life which is exploitative , humiliating and abusive .
' sexual slavery ' ' my life as a child prostitute ' one of the characters in the film i have made for the bbc is dalyn , a young girl from cambodia , who after years of counselling and therapy was able and willing to talk to us about how she was sold into sexual slavery in a brothel when she was 12 years old .
dalyn represents just one of the estimated 1.2 million children that the international labour organisation believes are trafficked every year .
tricked and forced into prostitution , dalyn spent much of her time locked in a cage with others underneath a brothel - starved , beaten and threatened at gun point until she agreed to service clients .
unregulated industry then there is the gentle and sweet 12-year-old boy mawulehawe from ghana , who is sold by his mother to a fishing " master " .
far from being the sadistic and immoral person you would expect , master aaron is friendly and completely open about what he does and his motives .
mawulehawe 's family believe he has been given an apprenticeship mawulehawe sits and listens as he is haggled over , eventually being sold for £ 25 -lrb- $ 48 -rrb- .
many people will be shocked and horrified by such a figure .
how can anyone , let alone a mother , put a price on a child 's head ?
but £ 25 in mawulehawe 's village is the equivalent of two months salary for a local teacher , or enough water to meet the needs of a family of six for over three months .
in selling him to a fishing master , his relatives believe that far from being sold into anything approximating slavery , mawulehawe is being given an apprenticeship , a chance for him to learn a trade .
but of course , not all fishing masters are as seemingly caring and gentle as aaron .
many of the boys which mawulehawe eventually joins , tell of the beatings , the dangers of diving to loosen trapped nets and the fatalities in this utterly unregulated industry .
forced to beg nearly three thousand miles away in saudi arabia , six-year-old ali was picked up by the authorities for begging on the streets of jeddah .
saudi arabia 's child slaves he was smuggled into saudi arabia from yemen for this purpose .
ali says he ended up begging after being beaten with a metal wire when he said he did not want to beg all day .
ali is one of thousands of yemeni children sold to gangs and forced to beg each year .
many of these children smuggled over the border are often sold by families who are duped into believing their offspring will get a better life .
my journey like many other news reporters , i have reported on children around the world who have been soldiers , prostitutes and workers at ages where their counterparts in the west would be in primary schools .
but news reports about child soldiers or prostitutes invariably turn to adults and international bodies to describe , analyse and contextualise the experiences .
in this documentary , we get to see and learn about the world of modern slavery in which these children live , through them , and as a result it provides a complex , disturbing , surprising and vivid look into a world many of us adults are oblivious to .
slavery means you do not have the freedom to say ' no ' i was born in somaliland , the self-declared republic in the north of somalia , where my relatives still live .
a couple of miles outside the capital hargeisa is a vast and flat savannah landscape that still belongs to nomads who herd camels and goats .
here , i met a shepherd boy called abdi , tending his family 's 35 goats and reflected on the fact that only one generation separates me from abdi .
i live in a comfortable house in west london , my children have scooters and summer holidays , yet my life could easily have been exactly like abdi 's .
my mother was a nomadic shepherd , and as a girl tended the family 's animals .
abdi may well have to work instead of going to school , but he is not enslaved .
slavery means you do not have the freedom to say no .
laws and standards poverty underlies almost all aspects of the phenomenon of modern child slavery .
it is the one issue that most often lies behind the reasons and circumstances they were given up or sold into such conditions .
yet although there has been progress internationally on creating laws and standards aimed at stamping out child slavery , there are still many adults who not only gain from child slavery but believe that they will , in more cases than not , get away with it .
defining what modern slavery is , even finding out the scale of it around the world , is not enough if the practice is not seen to be punished .

last updated : tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:37 gmt 08:37 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version child slavery with rageh omaar around 8.4 million children around the world are enslaved today .
now , in a remarkable journey across three continents , five of them tell their stories .
this documentary is presented by reporter rageh omaar .
mawulehawe maloway was sold to help alleviate his family 's poverty twelve-year-old mawulehawe has been sold by his mother to a local fishermen in ghana for $ 40 -lrb- £ 25 -rrb- .
he may not see his mother again for many years .
she will use the money to buy cooking oil to fry the fish she sells on the shore at ada , a small fishing town a couple of hours drive east of the capital , accra .
the fisherman to whom mawulehawe is sold , aaron , will take him away to serve a three-year apprenticeship .
mawulehawe , like many others in the region , is being sold to help alleviate his family 's poverty .
he has several brothers and sisters and has had some schooling , but there is not enough money for him to continue .
it is now his younger brother 's turn to go to school instead .
mawulehawe insists he is happy with the deal .
fishing has always been part of his life .
and as his family toast the " sale " with a strong drink , it is clear he sees his new life as a new adventure .
while many of the children working on lake volta go enthusiastically , most have no idea the dangers that lie ahead .
the long , unregulated hours and dangers such as getting tangled in the nets underneath the water 's surface can lead to accidents and fatalities .
ali the largest number of children found begging in saudi are from neighbouring yemen six-year-old ali was picked up by saudi authorities for begging on the streets of jeddah .
he was smuggled into saudi arabia from yemen in order to beg .
ali says he ended up begging after physical abuse involving metal wire attacks on his back .
he says he was beaten up when he said he did not want to beg all day .
ali is one of thousands of yemeni children sold to gangs and forced to beg each year .
these children are often sold by families who are duped into believing their offspring will get a better life .
many of the children who are smuggled over the saudi / yemen border are beaten and sometimes even mutilated to become better , more effective beggars .
it is hard to be exact about figures , but in 2005 the yemeni ministry of social affairs acknowledged that about 300 children were crossing the border every month .
rahul and amit amit -lrb- l -rrb- and rahul -lrb- r -rrb- worked in sweat-shops producing zaris the kumar cousins - rahul , 12 and amit , seven - thought they were leaving their remote village in the north east of india to go to school and learn a trade .
they had no idea their parents had sent them to one of the most populated cities in the world - delhi - to work in a sweat-shop .
the boys hated sewing beads on fabric for 18 hours a day .
they lived , worked and slept in the same tiny room and only saw daylight when they were allowed out on sunday under the supervision of a minder .
their hands are blistered and their feet deformed because of the repetitive nature of the work .
they were beaten and had little food .
children like rahul and amit who work in the zari units are classified as " bonded labourers " , often working to clear obscure debts usually incurred by their families .
" bonded labour " has been illegal in india since 1976 but legislation is largely unenforced and charitable organisations have taken on the burden of investigating illegal labour .
a non-governmental organisation helped the kumar boys to escape and return home ... but the welcome they received was not quite what they were expecting .
dalyn dalyn was rescued from a brothel when she was 13 years old when dalyn was only 12 years old , she was tricked and forced into prostitution .
she recalls how she was approached by a woman who asked her if she would like to work at a garment factory in kompong cham .
but when she arrived , she was sold to a brothel in cambodian capital pnomh penh for $ 150 -lrb- £ 78 -rrb- .
locked in a cage with others underneath the brothel , she was starved , beaten and threatened at gun point until she agreed to service clients .
many of the children at the shelter where dalyn is , became infected with hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases after being sold into sexual slavery , and all have been severely traumatised .
dalyn was rescued by the police and an aid agency but it is only now , at 17 years old and after substantial amounts of therapy , that she feels able to tell her story .
aid agencies are only able to scratch the surface of the problem of child sex slaves in cambodia .
in the first six months of last year , of the 186 raids carried out on brothels by the agency , only two resulted in convictions being made .
and in south east asia alone , unicef says one million children are involved in the commercial sex trade .
freddy freddy has been mining since he was six years old freddy , 11 , is not a slave .
he is enslaved by poverty .
he bunks off school to work illegally in a peruvian state-owned gold mine .
he either sneaks in when nobody is looking , or bribes someone to let him in .
what he finds , he keeps .
but the reality is that he finds very little .
he is up at 0500 and works all day .
if he does not find anything , he is beaten by his dad .
there is often no food in the house , so after working all day he begs for food from neighbours or in the street .
freddy is not alone .
the international labour organisation has estimated that up to 50,000 children are working in mines in peru .
freddy 's mine at la rinconada is located at one of the most inhospitable places on earth - 5,500 metres above sea level .
conditions are dangerous and miners often die from explosions inside .
freddy is also at risk from many chronic diseases that could affect him later in life having worked in a mine from such a young age .

dalyn dalyn was rescued from a brothel when she was 13 years old when dalyn was only 12 years old , she was tricked and forced into prostitution .

but when she arrived , she was sold to a brothel in cambodian capital pnomh penh for $ 150 -lrb- £ 78 -rrb- .
locked in a cage with others underneath the brothel , she was starved , beaten and threatened at gun point until she agreed to service clients .
many of the children at the shelter where dalyn is , became infected with hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases after being sold into sexual slavery , and all have been severely traumatised .
dalyn was rescued by the police and an aid agency but it is only now , at 17 years old and after substantial amounts of therapy , that she feels able to tell her story .
aid agencies are only able to scratch the surface of the problem of child sex slaves in cambodia .
in the first six months of last year , of the 186 raids carried out on brothels by the agency , only two resulted in convictions being made .
and in south east asia alone , unicef says one million children are involved in the commercial sex trade .
freddy freddy has been mining since he was six years old freddy , 11 , is not a slave .
he is enslaved by poverty .
he bunks off school to work illegally in a peruvian state-owned gold mine .
he either sneaks in when nobody is looking , or bribes someone to let him in .
what he finds , he keeps .
but the reality is that he finds very little .
he is up at 0500 and works all day .
if he does not find anything , he is beaten by his dad .
there is often no food in the house , so after working all day he begs for food from neighbours or in the street .
freddy is not alone .
the international labour organisation has estimated that up to 50,000 children are working in mines in peru .
freddy 's mine at la rinconada is located at one of the most inhospitable places on earth - 5,500 metres above sea level .
conditions are dangerous and miners often die from explosions inside .
freddy is also at risk from many chronic diseases that could affect him later in life having worked in a mine from such a young age .

last updated : tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:37 gmt 08:37 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the world of modern child slavery by rageh omaar presenter of bbc two documentary child slavery slavery is a word which immediately conjures up very specific images in our minds .
rageh omaar tries to discover the realities about child slavery programme preview when it is mentioned we tend to think of people , almost always black people ; degraded , abused and bound in chains , and we tend to think of such images , and the word slavery itself , as belonging to another era .
we do not see slavery as belonging to our world , not as something which is still happening today .
yet the truth is that if william wilberforce were alive today and he travelled to different parts of the world - not just in africa , but also in large parts of asia , the middle east , south america and even parts of europe - he would find children living in conditions and circumstances which wilberforce would understand and which i am sure he would describe as slavery .
it is believed there are nearly nine million children around the world today who are enslaved .
there are international charters and covenants which try to come to a legal definition of what constitutes slavery .
in essence these documents define slavery in the modern world as a situation where a human being and their labour are owned by others , and where that person does not have the freedom to leave and is forced into a life which is exploitative , humiliating and abusive .
' sexual slavery ' ' my life as a child prostitute ' one of the characters in the film i have made for the bbc is dalyn , a young girl from cambodia , who after years of counselling and therapy was able and willing to talk to us about how she was sold into sexual slavery in a brothel when she was 12 years old .
dalyn represents just one of the estimated 1.2 million children that the international labour organisation believes are trafficked every year .
tricked and forced into prostitution , dalyn spent much of her time locked in a cage with others underneath a brothel - starved , beaten and threatened at gun point until she agreed to service clients .
unregulated industry then there is the gentle and sweet 12-year-old boy mawulehawe from ghana , who is sold by his mother to a fishing " master " .
far from being the sadistic and immoral person you would expect , master aaron is friendly and completely open about what he does and his motives .
mawulehawe 's family believe he has been given an apprenticeship mawulehawe sits and listens as he is haggled over , eventually being sold for £ 25 -lrb- $ 48 -rrb- .
many people will be shocked and horrified by such a figure .
how can anyone , let alone a mother , put a price on a child 's head ?
but £ 25 in mawulehawe 's village is the equivalent of two months salary for a local teacher , or enough water to meet the needs of a family of six for over three months .
in selling him to a fishing master , his relatives believe that far from being sold into anything approximating slavery , mawulehawe is being given an apprenticeship , a chance for him to learn a trade .
but of course , not all fishing masters are as seemingly caring and gentle as aaron .
many of the boys which mawulehawe eventually joins , tell of the beatings , the dangers of diving to loosen trapped nets and the fatalities in this utterly unregulated industry .
forced to beg nearly three thousand miles away in saudi arabia , six-year-old ali was picked up by the authorities for begging on the streets of jeddah .
saudi arabia 's child slaves he was smuggled into saudi arabia from yemen for this purpose .
ali says he ended up begging after being beaten with a metal wire when he said he did not want to beg all day .
ali is one of thousands of yemeni children sold to gangs and forced to beg each year .
many of these children smuggled over the border are often sold by families who are duped into believing their offspring will get a better life .
my journey like many other news reporters , i have reported on children around the world who have been soldiers , prostitutes and workers at ages where their counterparts in the west would be in primary schools .
but news reports about child soldiers or prostitutes invariably turn to adults and international bodies to describe , analyse and contextualise the experiences .
in this documentary , we get to see and learn about the world of modern slavery in which these children live , through them , and as a result it provides a complex , disturbing , surprising and vivid look into a world many of us adults are oblivious to .
slavery means you do not have the freedom to say ' no ' i was born in somaliland , the self-declared republic in the north of somalia , where my relatives still live .
a couple of miles outside the capital hargeisa is a vast and flat savannah landscape that still belongs to nomads who herd camels and goats .
here , i met a shepherd boy called abdi , tending his family 's 35 goats and reflected on the fact that only one generation separates me from abdi .
i live in a comfortable house in west london , my children have scooters and summer holidays , yet my life could easily have been exactly like abdi 's .
my mother was a nomadic shepherd , and as a girl tended the family 's animals .
abdi may well have to work instead of going to school , but he is not enslaved .
slavery means you do not have the freedom to say no .
laws and standards poverty underlies almost all aspects of the phenomenon of modern child slavery .
it is the one issue that most often lies behind the reasons and circumstances they were given up or sold into such conditions .
yet although there has been progress internationally on creating laws and standards aimed at stamping out child slavery , there are still many adults who not only gain from child slavery but believe that they will , in more cases than not , get away with it .
defining what modern slavery is , even finding out the scale of it around the world , is not enough if the practice is not seen to be punished .

last updated : tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:37 gmt 08:37 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the world of modern child slavery by rageh omaar presenter of bbc two documentary child slavery slavery is a word which immediately conjures up very specific images in our minds .
rageh omaar tries to discover the realities about child slavery programme preview when it is mentioned we tend to think of people , almost always black people ; degraded , abused and bound in chains , and we tend to think of such images , and the word slavery itself , as belonging to another era .
we do not see slavery as belonging to our world , not as something which is still happening today .
yet the truth is that if william wilberforce were alive today and he travelled to different parts of the world - not just in africa , but also in large parts of asia , the middle east , south america and even parts of europe - he would find children living in conditions and circumstances which wilberforce would understand and which i am sure he would describe as slavery .
it is believed there are nearly nine million children around the world today who are enslaved .
there are international charters and covenants which try to come to a legal definition of what constitutes slavery .
in essence these documents define slavery in the modern world as a situation where a human being and their labour are owned by others , and where that person does not have the freedom to leave and is forced into a life which is exploitative , humiliating and abusive .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- this world -pipe- the world of modern child slavery bbc news / this world graphics version bbc sport home this world -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:37 gmt 08:37 uk the world of modern child slavery by rageh omaar presenter of bbc two documentary child slavery slavery is a word which immediately conjures up very specific images in our minds .
rageh omaar tries to discover the realities about child slavery when it is mentioned we tend to think of people , almost always black people ; degraded , abused and bound in chains , and we tend to think of such images , and the word slavery itself , as belonging to another era .
we do not see slavery as belonging to our world , not as something which is still happening today .
yet the truth is that if william wilberforce were alive today and he travelled to different parts of the world - not just in africa , but also in large parts of asia , the middle east , south america and even parts of europe - he would find children living in conditions and circumstances which wilberforce would understand and which i am sure he would describe as slavery .
it is believed there are nearly nine million children around the world today who are enslaved .
there are international charters and covenants which try to come to a legal definition of what constitutes slavery .
in essence these documents define slavery in the modern world as a situation where a human being and their labour are owned by others , and where that person does not have the freedom to leave and is forced into a life which is exploitative , humiliating and abusive .
' sexual slavery ' one of the characters in the film i have made for the bbc is dalyn , a young girl from cambodia , who after years of counselling and therapy was able and willing to talk to us about how she was sold into sexual slavery in a brothel when she was 12 years old .
dalyn represents just one of the estimated 1.2 million children that the international labour organisation believes are trafficked every year .
tricked and forced into prostitution , dalyn spent much of her time locked in a cage with others underneath a brothel - starved , beaten and threatened at gun point until she agreed to service clients .
unregulated industry then there is the gentle and sweet 12-year-old boy mawulehawe from ghana , who is sold by his mother to a fishing " master " .
far from being the sadistic and immoral person you would expect , master aaron is friendly and completely open about what he does and his motives .
mawulehawe sits and listens as he is haggled over , eventually being sold for £ 25 -lrb- $ 48 -rrb- .
many people will be shocked and horrified by such a figure .
how can anyone , let alone a mother , put a price on a child 's head ?
but £ 25 in mawulehawe 's village is the equivalent of two months salary for a local teacher , or enough water to meet the needs of a family of six for over three months .
in selling him to a fishing master , his relatives believe that far from being sold into anything approximating slavery , mawulehawe is being given an apprenticeship , a chance for him to learn a trade .
but of course , not all fishing masters are as seemingly caring and gentle as aaron .
many of the boys which mawulehawe eventually joins , tell of the beatings , the dangers of diving to loosen trapped nets and the fatalities in this utterly unregulated industry .
forced to beg nearly three thousand miles away in saudi arabia , six-year-old ali was picked up by the authorities for begging on the streets of jeddah .
he was smuggled into saudi arabia from yemen for this purpose .
ali says he ended up begging after being beaten with a metal wire when he said he did not want to beg all day .
ali is one of thousands of yemeni children sold to gangs and forced to beg each year .
many of these children smuggled over the border are often sold by families who are duped into believing their offspring will get a better life .

now , in a remarkable journey across three continents , five of them tell their stories .
this documentary is presented by reporter rageh omaar .
mawulehawe twelve-year-old mawulehawe has been sold by his mother to a local fishermen in ghana for $ 40 -lrb- £ 25 -rrb- .
he may not see his mother again for many years .
she will use the money to buy cooking oil to fry the fish she sells on the shore at ada , a small fishing town a couple of hours drive east of the capital , accra .
the fisherman to whom mawulehawe is sold , aaron , will take him away to serve a three-year apprenticeship .
mawulehawe , like many others in the region , is being sold to help alleviate his family 's poverty .
he has several brothers and sisters and has had some schooling , but there is not enough money for him to continue .
it is now his younger brother 's turn to go to school instead .
mawulehawe insists he is happy with the deal .
fishing has always been part of his life .
and as his family toast the " sale " with a strong drink , it is clear he sees his new life as a new adventure .
while many of the children working on lake volta go enthusiastically , most have no idea the dangers that lie ahead .
the long , unregulated hours and dangers such as getting tangled in the nets underneath the water 's surface can lead to accidents and fatalities .
ali six-year-old ali was picked up by saudi authorities for begging on the streets of jeddah .
he was smuggled into saudi arabia from yemen in order to beg .
ali says he ended up begging after physical abuse involving metal wire attacks on his back .
he says he was beaten up when he said he did not want to beg all day .
ali is one of thousands of yemeni children sold to gangs and forced to beg each year .
these children are often sold by families who are duped into believing their offspring will get a better life .
many of the children who are smuggled over the saudi / yemen border are beaten and sometimes even mutilated to become better , more effective beggars .
it is hard to be exact about figures , but in 2005 the yemeni ministry of social affairs acknowledged that about 300 children were crossing the border every month .
rahul and amit the kumar cousins - rahul , 12 and amit , seven - thought they were leaving their remote village in the north east of india to go to school and learn a trade .
they had no idea their parents had sent them to one of the most populated cities in the world - delhi - to work in a sweat-shop .
the boys hated sewing beads on fabric for 18 hours a day .
they lived , worked and slept in the same tiny room and only saw daylight when they were allowed out on sunday under the supervision of a minder .
their hands are blistered and their feet deformed because of the repetitive nature of the work .
they were beaten and had little food .
children like rahul and amit who work in the zari units are classified as " bonded labourers " , often working to clear obscure debts usually incurred by their families .
" bonded labour " has been illegal in india since 1976 but legislation is largely unenforced and charitable organisations have taken on the burden of investigating illegal labour .
a non-governmental organisation helped the kumar boys to escape and return home ... but the welcome they received was not quite what they were expecting .
dalyn when dalyn was only 12 years old , she was tricked and forced into prostitution .
she recalls how she was approached by a woman who asked her if she would like to work at a garment factory in kompong cham .
but when she arrived , she was sold to a brothel in cambodian capital pnomh penh for $ 150 -lrb- £ 78 -rrb- .
locked in a cage with others underneath the brothel , she was starved , beaten and threatened at gun point until she agreed to service clients .
many of the children at the shelter where dalyn is , became infected with hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases after being sold into sexual slavery , and all have been severely traumatised .
dalyn was rescued by the police and an aid agency but it is only now , at 17 years old and after substantial amounts of therapy , that she feels able to tell her story .
aid agencies are only able to scratch the surface of the problem of child sex slaves in cambodia .
in the first six months of last year , of the 186 raids carried out on brothels by the agency , only two resulted in convictions being made .
and in south east asia alone , unicef says one million children are involved in the commercial sex trade .
freddy freddy , 11 , is not a slave .
he is enslaved by poverty .
he bunks off school to work illegally in a peruvian state-owned gold mine .
he either sneaks in when nobody is looking , or bribes someone to let him in .
what he finds , he keeps .
but the reality is that he finds very little .
he is up at 0500 and works all day .
if he does not find anything , he is beaten by his dad .
there is often no food in the house , so after working all day he begs for food from neighbours or in the street .
freddy is not alone .
the international labour organisation has estimated that up to 50,000 children are working in mines in peru .
freddy 's mine at la rinconada is located at one of the most inhospitable places on earth - 5,500 metres above sea level .
conditions are dangerous and miners often die from explosions inside .
freddy is also at risk from many chronic diseases that could affect him later in life having worked in a mine from such a young age .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- this world -pipe- the child slaves of saudi arabia bbc news / this world graphics version bbc sport home this world -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:38 gmt 08:38 uk the child slaves of saudi arabia ali was beaten up for initially refusing to beg on the wealthy streets of jeddah , in saudi arabia , thousands of young child-beggars , under the auspices of ruthless gangmasters , are simply trying to survive .
many hail from countries like yemen which , despite bordering one of the middle east 's richest states , is a world away in terms of economic prosperity .
these children are often sold by families who are either duped into believing their offspring will get a better life or sometimes simply threatened .
once in the country , they are likely to face beatings and are sometimes even mutilated as their dickensian masters stoop to any low to try to improve the chances of them earning more money .
the ministry of social affairs in saudi arabia 's western province has a unit dedicated to picking up children who are illegal in the country .
it is tasked with taking these children from the streets and then investigating their stories .
efforts are made to try to find their families but often no relatives are found .
in such cases , these youngsters are deported as illegal aliens back to their country of origin . "
what is clear is that they are working for others , out of education , kept in a cycle of poverty and danger " but to bring these children in , the unit must carry out night-time swoops to find children begging without families .
when these children are found , they are often frightened and desperate to get away from the saudi officials .
one child found by the team during a raid , ali , is a typical victim of the slavery business .
initially , he attempted to convince officials that he was in the city with his brother .
however , it soon became clear that this was not the case .
' smuggled ' eventually , ali revealed that he slept under a bridge or in " any house " he could find .
he avoided using shoes , to boost his chances of getting money .
while the details of ali 's story are sketchy , we know that ali was smuggled across the porous border between the yemen and saudi arabia .
in 2005 , the yemeni ministry of social affairs acknowledged that about 300 children were crossing the border every month .
it is not always possible to know the entire truth about these children but what is clear , is that they are working for others , out of education , and kept in a cycle of poverty and danger .
ali told officials at the shelter : " i was smuggled in , in order to beg .
i told him -lrb- the gangmaster -rrb- i do n't want to beg , so he beat me up . "
the boy said he ended up begging because of physical abuse involving metal wire attacks to his back .
he also said he was forced to beg all day , but claimed that he only gave some of his earnings back to his paymaster .
fake story such is the scale of the problem that a centre to house rescued children has been opened in yemen at the harad border crossing .
that is ali 's most likely destination .
the precise truth of his story will probably never be known .
even officials in the shelter do not really believe the account he has given them , citing inconsistencies with earlier interviews .
those brought to the shelter have often been schooled to give some sort of false story about having families in saudi arabia .
the children caught are almost entirely boys and although many come from yemen , others come from countries such as somalia , sudan , chad , pakistan and india .
yemen has become more involved in child trafficking since its workers were expelled from saudi arabia in the 1990s following the first gulf war .
children were sent instead because saudi authorities do not prosecute children .
meanwhile , the future for ali is uncertain .
a delegate from the yemeni embassy will visit the shelter to pursue ali 's case and try to trace his family .
in all likelihood , he will be deported back to his country of origin , but with the trade of children continuing to rise , saudi officials will probably be meeting many more like him .

last updated : tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:38 gmt 08:38 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version my life as a child prostitute dalyn wants to do all she can to help others rebuild their lives programme preview dalyn , 17 , was once among the thousands of young children working as prostitutes in cambodia .
now living in a shelter , this is her disturbing account of being a child sex slave .
i was living with my grandfather in cambodia .
as a normal , happy child i did not fear anything .
then , at 12 years old , a woman asked me whether i would like to work at a garment factory .
i agreed and went with her .
but she sold me to the owner of a brothel in phnom penh , the cambodian capital .
i felt betrayed and cheated .
i thought i was going to find work .
i never thought i was going to be sold like that .
it is slavery of the worst kind .
they have total power over you ; they get you to do anything they want there were lots of other boys and girls at the brothel .
i overheard two pimps bargaining and heard one of them say my price was $ 150 -lrb- £ 78 -rrb- .
my heart sank and i started asking myself where the hell had i ended up .
intimidation i saw many couples coming in and out of the rooms .
from that moment on , i knew something was seriously wrong .
i was frightened and desperately wanted to ask the children what kind of place this was .
a group of men came into my room and told me to receive a client .
i asked what i was supposed to do .
they told me : " do n't worry , you 'll know what to do .
and if you do n't , you 'll do it until you do . "
i refused but they told me to shut up and said that " one way or the other " i was going to have to do as they say .
they dragged me out of the room and i screamed and called out for help .
they put a gun to my head .
i pleaded for my life , telling them this was n't the work i had been led to believe i would be doing .
but the brothel owner said : " you did n't follow anyone here .
you 're here of your own free will .
you are a prostitute and you came here looking to work as a prostitute . "
i said : " i 'm young and i have my future ahead of me .
please do n't make me do something like this . "
starved but then he said i would be shot if i refused .
he ordered in a group of men carrying electric cables .
i cried and screamed out for help but nobody came .
they starved me until i agreed to go with clients .
poverty remains a major problem in cambodia i was locked in a cage with others underneath the brothel for entire days .
i was only ever allowed out when a client came .
some clients were considerate and quite kind .
others were not .
if i refused to perform particular sex acts , clients would beat me up and report me to the brothel owner .
the brothel owner would also beat me and tell the other girls in the brothel to beat me too .
the psychological impact was horrendous .
it lives with me even to this day .
when it finally dawned on me that i was a prostitute , i felt a sense of utter disgust .
i had become the very thing i most despised .
it is slavery of the worst kind .
they have total power over you - they get you to do anything they want .
you feel like dirt and there is nothing you can do except follow orders .
you could end up dead .
rescue i was scared right up until the brothel owner was arrested .
then i realised that we were being rescued .
we were rescued by the police and the afesip , an organisation whose founder , somaly mam , is a former child sex slave and famous figure in cambodia .
i was so relieved and happy .
i do not know what the future will bring .
i feel it is my obligation to tell everyone that they should do everything they can to prevent themselves and others going through prostitution and all the things i had to go through .
by the end of it , you will end up lower then you can ever imagine ... in hell .

last updated : tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:38 gmt 08:38 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the child slaves of saudi arabia ali was beaten up for initially refusing to beg programme preview on the wealthy streets of jeddah , in saudi arabia , thousands of young child-beggars , under the auspices of ruthless gangmasters , are simply trying to survive .
many hail from countries like yemen which , despite bordering one of the middle east 's richest states , is a world away in terms of economic prosperity .
these children are often sold by families who are either duped into believing their offspring will get a better life or sometimes simply threatened .
once in the country , they are likely to face beatings and are sometimes even mutilated as their dickensian masters stoop to any low to try to improve the chances of them earning more money .
the ministry of social affairs in saudi arabia 's western province has a unit dedicated to picking up children who are illegal in the country .
it is tasked with taking these children from the streets and then investigating their stories .
efforts are made to try to find their families but often no relatives are found .
in such cases , these youngsters are deported as illegal aliens back to their country of origin .
what is clear is that they are working for others , out of education , kept in a cycle of poverty and danger but to bring these children in , the unit must carry out night-time swoops to find children begging without families .
when these children are found , they are often frightened and desperate to get away from the saudi officials .
one child found by the team during a raid , ali , is a typical victim of the slavery business .
initially , he attempted to convince officials that he was in the city with his brother .
however , it soon became clear that this was not the case .
' smuggled ' eventually , ali revealed that he slept under a bridge or in " any house " he could find .
he avoided using shoes , to boost his chances of getting money .
while the details of ali 's story are sketchy , we know that ali was smuggled across the porous border between the yemen and saudi arabia .
in 2005 , the yemeni ministry of social affairs acknowledged that about 300 children were crossing the border every month .
it is not always possible to know the entire truth about these children but what is clear , is that they are working for others , out of education , and kept in a cycle of poverty and danger .
ali told officials at the shelter : " i was smuggled in , in order to beg .
i told him -lrb- the gangmaster -rrb- i do n't want to beg , so he beat me up . "
the boy said he ended up begging because of physical abuse involving metal wire attacks to his back .
he also said he was forced to beg all day , but claimed that he only gave some of his earnings back to his paymaster .
fake story such is the scale of the problem that a centre to house rescued children has been opened in yemen at the harad border crossing .
ali now faces an uncertain future that is ali 's most likely destination .
the precise truth of his story will probably never be known .
even officials in the shelter do not really believe the account he has given them , citing inconsistencies with earlier interviews .
those brought to the shelter have often been schooled to give some sort of false story about having families in saudi arabia .
the children caught are almost entirely boys and although many come from yemen , others come from countries such as somalia , sudan , chad , pakistan and india .
yemen has become more involved in child trafficking since its workers were expelled from saudi arabia in the 1990s following the first gulf war .
children were sent instead because saudi authorities do not prosecute children .
meanwhile , the future for ali is uncertain .
a delegate from the yemeni embassy will visit the shelter to pursue ali 's case and try to trace his family .
in all likelihood , he will be deported back to his country of origin , but with the trade of children continuing to rise , saudi officials will probably be meeting many more like him .

he also said he was forced to beg all day , but claimed that he only gave some of his earnings back to his paymaster .
fake story such is the scale of the problem that a centre to house rescued children has been opened in yemen at the harad border crossing .
ali now faces an uncertain future that is ali 's most likely destination .
the precise truth of his story will probably never be known .
even officials in the shelter do not really believe the account he has given them , citing inconsistencies with earlier interviews .
those brought to the shelter have often been schooled to give some sort of false story about having families in saudi arabia .
the children caught are almost entirely boys and although many come from yemen , others come from countries such as somalia , sudan , chad , pakistan and india .
yemen has become more involved in child trafficking since its workers were expelled from saudi arabia in the 1990s following the first gulf war .
children were sent instead because saudi authorities do not prosecute children .
meanwhile , the future for ali is uncertain .
a delegate from the yemeni embassy will visit the shelter to pursue ali 's case and try to trace his family .
in all likelihood , he will be deported back to his country of origin , but with the trade of children continuing to rise , saudi officials will probably be meeting many more like him .

last updated : tuesday , 27 march 2007 , 07:38 gmt 08:38 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the child slaves of saudi arabia ali was beaten up for initially refusing to beg programme preview on the wealthy streets of jeddah , in saudi arabia , thousands of young child-beggars , under the auspices of ruthless gangmasters , are simply trying to survive .
many hail from countries like yemen which , despite bordering one of the middle east 's richest states , is a world away in terms of economic prosperity .
these children are often sold by families who are either duped into believing their offspring will get a better life or sometimes simply threatened .
once in the country , they are likely to face beatings and are sometimes even mutilated as their dickensian masters stoop to any low to try to improve the chances of them earning more money .
the ministry of social affairs in saudi arabia 's western province has a unit dedicated to picking up children who are illegal in the country .
it is tasked with taking these children from the streets and then investigating their stories .
efforts are made to try to find their families but often no relatives are found .
in such cases , these youngsters are deported as illegal aliens back to their country of origin .
what is clear is that they are working for others , out of education , kept in a cycle of poverty and danger but to bring these children in , the unit must carry out night-time swoops to find children begging without families .
when these children are found , they are often frightened and desperate to get away from the saudi officials .
one child found by the team during a raid , ali , is a typical victim of the slavery business .
initially , he attempted to convince officials that he was in the city with his brother .
however , it soon became clear that this was not the case .
' smuggled ' eventually , ali revealed that he slept under a bridge or in " any house " he could find .
he avoided using shoes , to boost his chances of getting money .
while the details of ali 's story are sketchy , we know that ali was smuggled across the porous border between the yemen and saudi arabia .
in 2005 , the yemeni ministry of social affairs acknowledged that about 300 children were crossing the border every month .
it is not always possible to know the entire truth about these children but what is clear , is that they are working for others , out of education , and kept in a cycle of poverty and danger .
ali told officials at the shelter : " i was smuggled in , in order to beg .
i told him -lrb- the gangmaster -rrb- i do n't want to beg , so he beat me up . "
the boy said he ended up begging because of physical abuse involving metal wire attacks to his back .
he also said he was forced to beg all day , but claimed that he only gave some of his earnings back to his paymaster .
fake story such is the scale of the problem that a centre to house rescued children has been opened in yemen at the harad border crossing .
ali now faces an uncertain future that is ali 's most likely destination .
the precise truth of his story will probably never be known .

now living in a shelter , this is her disturbing account of being a child sex slave .
i was living with my grandfather in cambodia .
as a normal , happy child i did not fear anything .
then , at 12 years old , a woman asked me whether i would like to work at a garment factory .
i agreed and went with her .
but she sold me to the owner of a brothel in phnom penh , the cambodian capital .
i felt betrayed and cheated .
i thought i was going to find work .
i never thought i was going to be sold like that .
it is slavery of the worst kind .
they have total power over you ; they get you to do anything they want there were lots of other boys and girls at the brothel .
i overheard two pimps bargaining and heard one of them say my price was $ 150 -lrb- £ 78 -rrb- .
my heart sank and i started asking myself where the hell had i ended up .
intimidation i saw many couples coming in and out of the rooms .
from that moment on , i knew something was seriously wrong .
i was frightened and desperately wanted to ask the children what kind of place this was .
a group of men came into my room and told me to receive a client .
i asked what i was supposed to do .
they told me : " do n't worry , you 'll know what to do .
and if you do n't , you 'll do it until you do . "
i refused but they told me to shut up and said that " one way or the other " i was going to have to do as they say .
they dragged me out of the room and i screamed and called out for help .
they put a gun to my head .
i pleaded for my life , telling them this was n't the work i had been led to believe i would be doing .
but the brothel owner said : " you did n't follow anyone here .
you 're here of your own free will .
you are a prostitute and you came here looking to work as a prostitute . "
i said : " i 'm young and i have my future ahead of me .
please do n't make me do something like this . "
starved but then he said i would be shot if i refused .
he ordered in a group of men carrying electric cables .
i cried and screamed out for help but nobody came .
they starved me until i agreed to go with clients .
poverty remains a major problem in cambodia i was locked in a cage with others underneath the brothel for entire days .
i was only ever allowed out when a client came .
some clients were considerate and quite kind .
others were not .
if i refused to perform particular sex acts , clients would beat me up and report me to the brothel owner .
the brothel owner would also beat me and tell the other girls in the brothel to beat me too .
the psychological impact was horrendous .
it lives with me even to this day .
when it finally dawned on me that i was a prostitute , i felt a sense of utter disgust .
i had become the very thing i most despised .
it is slavery of the worst kind .
they have total power over you - they get you to do anything they want .
you feel like dirt and there is nothing you can do except follow orders .
you could end up dead .
rescue i was scared right up until the brothel owner was arrested .
then i realised that we were being rescued .
we were rescued by the police and the afesip , an organisation whose founder , somaly mam , is a former child sex slave and famous figure in cambodia .
i was so relieved and happy .
i do not know what the future will bring .
i feel it is my obligation to tell everyone that they should do everything they can to prevent themselves and others going through prostitution and all the things i had to go through .
by the end of it , you will end up lower then you can ever imagine ... in hell .

figures so far for march show the service is reaching 60.8 % of emergency calls within eight minutes .
it beats the 60 % target set by the welsh assembly government .
it follows a difficult period for the service , which last month asked people living in cardiff and the vale of glamorgan to only dial 999 in a life-threatening emergency .
the service said it had beaten the target to far this month and was on track to maintain that level .
official quarterly figures will be released in may .
rapid response the figure for march , traditionally one of the most difficult months for the service , compares to 49.8 % a month earlier . "
we must n't rest on our laurels and must make the changes in work practice the new norm " mike cassidy , wales ambulance trust director of ambulance services mike cassidy has praised staff for their commitment to meeting the " very challenging " target .
" they have worked magnificently to make this happen , especially after a february when adverse weather conditions and problems with ambulances queuing at hospitals caused the system to crash , " he said .
the service has been thrust into crisis over the last 12 months , with changes at the top and a public inquiry ordered by assembly members into failings .
new chief executive alan murray took over last august , when the figure for calls reached in eight minutes was 55.4 % .
a series of measures , designed to bring improvements have since been brought in .
these include using gps in control centres , more use of rapid response vehicles and " dynamic deployment " - where the service predicts where demand for ambulances is going to be , according to mr cassidy .
he added : " we must n't rest on our laurels and must make the changes in work practice the new norm and for that we depend on the professionalism and flexibility of our staff to work with us to drive even more effective strategies for improving response times . "

the last few months have seen protests in the capital , santiago , over the introduction of a new transport system .
in a national tv address , ms bachelet said her government owed an apology to santiago 's residents , especially the poor , for the chaos they have faced .
it is the second big cabinet reshuffle since she took office in 2006 .
the first one followed student protests .
increased strain speaking on monday evening , ms bachelet said her government was beginning a new era in which mistakes would no longer be accepted .
ms bachelet said mistakes would no longer be accepted transport minister sergio espejo - one of those removed from his post on monday - had been the focus of criticism since the transantiago transport system was introduced on 10 february .
with the transantiago , large areas of santiago - a city of about 6m inhabitants - were left almost devoid of public transportation , forcing people to walk long distances to catch a reduced number of buses .
the system came under more strain with the start of the school year at the beginning of march .
the capital 's metro system has been unable to cope with the large numbers of commuters , with reports of people fighting to get on overcrowded trains .
emergency rooms the number of passengers trying to use the underground is said to have almost doubled , with some 2.2m users in a week .
one person is reported to have died from a heart attack as a result of the crush , another died after fainting from lack of oxygen .
the authorities have set up emergency rooms to deal with the increased numbers of cases of fainting due to the lack of oxygen and higher temperatures .
the transport problems have sparked frequent protests in santiago 's poorer neighbourhoods , where roads have been blocked with barricades .
ms bachelet - whose popularity rating is said to have fallen to about 47 % - also replaced the justice minister , the defence minister and her chief of staff .
have you been affected by the travel problems in santiago ?
a selection of your comments : i currently live in santiago and see this chaos every single day .
the system is a good idea but it was badly implemented with not very much information on the new routes .
i have to say though , the majority of the people left it until the very last minute to purchase special cards and only informed themselves when they needed to use the system instead of beforehand and that led to a lot of confusion and long queues .
emma , santiago , chile i was in santiago in early february when transantiago began , and it was ridiculous .
the worst aspect was the lack of information provided to commuters - thousands of people were left standing at bus stops , not knowing which buses stopped there .
the signage was confusing , or simply non-existent so riders were left guessing which buses stopped there .
many gave up hope of finding their proper bus , and took to the subway , which then became jammed with more people than it could handle .
my sympathies go out to santiaguinos , especially the lower class who as usual are neglected and powerless .
paul , denver , colorado , usa yes i am affected and my family .
this a complete change in the public transport system which required more time and planning and with the various changes being implemented separately .
unfortunatly that was not adopted and in tippicle latin american politaical and legistalive ways introduced with the resulting chaos and little pry forethought .
it is an excellent and abicious plan that certainly has reduced the pollution levels caused by the old public bus service and in time it will work .
graham kenny , santiago , chile the transantiago transport system has been poorly designed and implemented .
it started with the idea of santiago 's subway -lrb- metro -rrb- as the core of the transport system .
as a result , people tend to use the subway instead of buses , and even so , these buses are filled with people , as full as he subway .
cristián rojas poblete , santiago , chile i was there when the new lines of the metro went into puente alto but for such a large city it has a very limited scope .
i left just before the news of the reduction of buses and i thought it was madness .
the bus system is horrible , used by low income citizens it seems no one cares that the drivers drive like mainiacs , do n't stop to pick people up if they do n't feel like it , the buses are disgustingly dirty and on some routes personal safety is an issue .
something has to be done , citizens in santiago live with appalling pollution but if the only option to the car is this transit system everyone will suffer .
diana , vancouver , canada although it is true that the system has had important problems of implementation and poor planning , protests have been very localized as many people understand that a transportation system change of such a magnitude can only be a benefit for everybody .
ismael , santiago , chile in november of 2006 , my husband and i traveled for 24 days in chile and found the bus system to be a wonderful way to travel around chile .
we were very impressed .
at that time , the metro was so packed we could harldy get on .
i hope that they solve the problems before we go back .
