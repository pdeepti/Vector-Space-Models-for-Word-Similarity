climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .
“ it is possible that summer tourism in the mountains will be rediscovered , ” keller said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's created a hassle for one prominent subculture in prague . ever since the fall of communism , the czech capital prague has been a magnet for young americans .
the rents were cheap , the beer was good , and ex-pats needed only to hop across the border every three months to renew their status as " tourists . "
but that situation is set to change on jan .
1 , when the czech republic , together with eight other newer eu members , becomes party to the schengen agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are lots of reasons to want to stay in prague ex-pats will now have to depart the schengen zone - the nearest countries being switzerland , ukraine and romania - in order to officially leave the czech republic .
and tourist visas will only permit holders to reside within the zone for three months in any six-month period .
the us embassy estimates the number of " yappies " -lrb- young americans in prague -rrb- to be around 5,000 , but the actual figure may be far higher .
the approach of schengen has caused those , who never bothered getting the proper paperwork to feel very skittish .
" i was afraid i might have to leave the country , or at least go away for a time , " long-term ex-pat eric snow told the afp news agency .
new cottage industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of jan .
1 , a quick drive across the border is no longer an option snow decided to upgrade his visa so that he could stay .
but it was the beginning of a long and arduous paper chase .
a web site set up to help ex-pats was of no use , as was a trip to the czech consulate in dresden , germany to try to get his visa changed .
eventually , he had to hire an expert to help him through the bureaucratic maze .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " permanent tourists " risk run-ins with czech authorities " i would never try to do this on my own , " snow said .
" get an agent is all i can say . "
snow paid the equivalent of 190 euros -lrb- $ 279 -rrb- to sort out his situation .
the need of ex-pats for assistance in dealing with immigration officials has created a business opportunity for native czechs .
" we have got about twice as much interest as we did at this time last year , " visa-enabling agent nora vinduskova told afp .
vinduskova said her clients also included people from australia , canada , japan and thailand .
in the end , snow got what he wanted , but the clock is ticking fast for some other members of prague vibrant ex-pat community . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans open their presents on dec .
24 ideas for this special " countdown " calendar with little doors to open first began circulating at the start of the 20th century .
it used to be that opening a door would reveal a little picture that was slightly transparent .
that way , you could put your calendar in a window or in front of a candle , mark-zobel said .
" and when there were no more doors left to open , then you knew ' thank goodness , tonight is christmas mass , and afterwards we get our presents ! " ' dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he turned out to be right - but young people 's ignorance of the not-so-distant past is now a cause for concern to education experts . cold war rhetoric was mother 's milk to most people over 30 today .
raised in a country spliced into two by the iron curtain , west germans grew up with the specter of the big red menace .
communist east germany was , they believed , a joyless dictatorship where people could only dream of owning a pair of levis or the latest rolling stones record , had to wait for years for the privilege of driving a smoke-belching trabant car , and regularly grassed on their neighbors to the secret police . granted , this might not have been the whole truth .
but 17 years after reunification , young people are equally ill-informed .
only now , they see this chapter in history through rose-tinted spectacles - if they think about it at all . ignored or glossed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers today do n't realize the gdr was a dictatorship when researchers at berlin 's freie universität asked 5000 high school students in four german states including berlin , brandenburg and bavaria to fill out a questionnaire testing their knowledge of pre-1989 germany , they discovered that 66 percent of students in north-rhine westphalia did not even consider the gdr a dictatorship . further misconceptions among 15-17-year-olds today are that communist east germany held democratic elections , that former german chancellor helmut kohl was one of its main politicians and that the allies built the berlin wall .
rents were low , child-care excellent and the environment better looked after than it was in west germany , according to the teenagers . but the gaps in their knowledge are hardly surprising , according to monika deutz-schroeder from the research team . " most of the students complain that the subject is either ignored or glossed over in class , " she said .
" then in the eastern states , teachers tend to put a positive spin on the gdr , either out of political conviction or a lack of awareness . " some teachers , according to deutz-schroeder , know very little about certain aspects of the gdr , such as the fact that it practiced capital punishment or that income scales were far from equal . " we need to see improved teacher training on the subject , " she said . " a cute little country " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum gives people a glimpse of life in the gdr inadequate training is one problem - a lack of interest another . " one obstacle is that east german history - unlike nazism - is seen by most west germans not as shared history but as the history of the east germans only , " deutz-schroeder said . it would be mistaken , however , to hold only the teachers responsible for this skewed view of history . " particularly in the eastern part of the country and eastern berlin , students base their knowledge of the gdr on what their parents say , " explained schroeder .
" some of them idealize the gdr , emphasizing its supposed benefits such as a sense of solidarity , greater social equality and guaranteed employment . " moreover , the movie and television industry often wallows in nostalgic humor . " films such as ' goodbye lenin ' make the gdr look harmless , " she said . " students are left with the impression that it was just a backward , cute little country .
they 'd be better off watching ' the lives of others , " ' she added , referring to the 2006 academy award-winning drama about a stasi officer and the people he spied on . the political is personal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : films like ' goodbye lenin ' romanticize the past covering the uniquely complex range of 20th century german history , however , can be simply too time-consuming . " the subject is on the curriculum , but teachers often devote too much time to the nazi era , the second world war and the post-war period , " deutz-schroeder pointed out . henning schluß , an education expert at berlin 's humboldt university who has developed a core curriculum for teaching gdr history at high school level , agrees that a lack of time is an issue , but believes the problem is basically a more subtle one . " understandably , teachers are reluctant to talk about a phase of history in which they were personally involved , " he said .
" in the former east germany , teachers were under extreme pressure to conform to the ruling ideology .
those who had n't been informers for the secret police were usually able to continue working after reunification .
now they have to apply critical faculties to an era in which they played a more or less uncritical role - or even participated in with active enthusiasm .
they have to come to terms with their own past . " living history ultimately , schluß feels this could be an actual boon to the class . " for teenagers today , the gdr is , literally , history .
they grew up in a reunified germany , which means teachers can discuss the country 's division in the same way they can discuss the thirty years ' war .
it has no immediacy to the students . " there are many germans , however , who have had a first-hand experience with the communist dictatorship .
they are the ones who could paint a vivid picture of what it was really like , back in the gdr . " the great thing is that young people have the opportunity to benefit from eye-witness accounts - which they do n't have when they 're learning about the thirty years ' war , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 16.12.2007 alpine tourism 's melting prospects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll follow the snow snow-covered mountains are the main tourist draw in the alps .
climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .
“ it is possible that summer tourism in the mountains will be rediscovered , ” keller said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 16.12.2007 alpine tourism 's melting prospects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll follow the snow snow-covered mountains are the main tourist draw in the alps .
climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .
“ it is possible that summer tourism in the mountains will be rediscovered , ” keller said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .

alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2007 europe without borders threatens ex-pats without visas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-pats in the czech republic will be subject to schengen-wide rules as of 2008 , the czech republic will join the schengen agreement , meaning that people with right papers can travel freely to most other eu nations .
but that 's created a hassle for one prominent subculture in prague . ever since the fall of communism , the czech capital prague has been a magnet for young americans .
the rents were cheap , the beer was good , and ex-pats needed only to hop across the border every three months to renew their status as " tourists . "
but that situation is set to change on jan .
1 , when the czech republic , together with eight other newer eu members , becomes party to the schengen agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are lots of reasons to want to stay in prague ex-pats will now have to depart the schengen zone - the nearest countries being switzerland , ukraine and romania - in order to officially leave the czech republic .
and tourist visas will only permit holders to reside within the zone for three months in any six-month period .
the us embassy estimates the number of " yappies " -lrb- young americans in prague -rrb- to be around 5,000 , but the actual figure may be far higher .
the approach of schengen has caused those , who never bothered getting the proper paperwork to feel very skittish .
" i was afraid i might have to leave the country , or at least go away for a time , " long-term ex-pat eric snow told the afp news agency .
new cottage industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of jan .
1 , a quick drive across the border is no longer an option snow decided to upgrade his visa so that he could stay .
but it was the beginning of a long and arduous paper chase .
a web site set up to help ex-pats was of no use , as was a trip to the czech consulate in dresden , germany to try to get his visa changed .
eventually , he had to hire an expert to help him through the bureaucratic maze .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " permanent tourists " risk run-ins with czech authorities " i would never try to do this on my own , " snow said .
" get an agent is all i can say . "
snow paid the equivalent of 190 euros -lrb- $ 279 -rrb- to sort out his situation .
the need of ex-pats for assistance in dealing with immigration officials has created a business opportunity for native czechs .
" we have got about twice as much interest as we did at this time last year , " visa-enabling agent nora vinduskova told afp .
vinduskova said her clients also included people from australia , canada , japan and thailand .
in the end , snow got what he wanted , but the clock is ticking fast for some other members of prague vibrant ex-pat community . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 16.12.2007 alpine tourism 's melting prospects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll follow the snow snow-covered mountains are the main tourist draw in the alps .
climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .

6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .
“ it is possible that summer tourism in the mountains will be rediscovered , ” keller said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans open their presents on dec .
24 ideas for this special " countdown " calendar with little doors to open first began circulating at the start of the 20th century .
it used to be that opening a door would reveal a little picture that was slightly transparent .
that way , you could put your calendar in a window or in front of a candle , mark-zobel said .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .
“ it is possible that summer tourism in the mountains will be rediscovered , ” keller said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans open their presents on dec .
24 ideas for this special " countdown " calendar with little doors to open first began circulating at the start of the 20th century .
it used to be that opening a door would reveal a little picture that was slightly transparent .
that way , you could put your calendar in a window or in front of a candle , mark-zobel said .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans open their presents on dec .
24 ideas for this special " countdown " calendar with little doors to open first began circulating at the start of the 20th century .
it used to be that opening a door would reveal a little picture that was slightly transparent .
that way , you could put your calendar in a window or in front of a candle , mark-zobel said .
" and when there were no more doors left to open , then you knew ' thank goodness , tonight is christmas mass , and afterwards we get our presents ! " ' dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he turned out to be right - but young people 's ignorance of the not-so-distant past is now a cause for concern to education experts . cold war rhetoric was mother 's milk to most people over 30 today .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .
“ it is possible that summer tourism in the mountains will be rediscovered , ” keller said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's created a hassle for one prominent subculture in prague . ever since the fall of communism , the czech capital prague has been a magnet for young americans .
the rents were cheap , the beer was good , and ex-pats needed only to hop across the border every three months to renew their status as " tourists . "
but that situation is set to change on jan .
1 , when the czech republic , together with eight other newer eu members , becomes party to the schengen agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are lots of reasons to want to stay in prague ex-pats will now have to depart the schengen zone - the nearest countries being switzerland , ukraine and romania - in order to officially leave the czech republic .
and tourist visas will only permit holders to reside within the zone for three months in any six-month period .
the us embassy estimates the number of " yappies " -lrb- young americans in prague -rrb- to be around 5,000 , but the actual figure may be far higher .
the approach of schengen has caused those , who never bothered getting the proper paperwork to feel very skittish .
" i was afraid i might have to leave the country , or at least go away for a time , " long-term ex-pat eric snow told the afp news agency .
new cottage industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of jan .
1 , a quick drive across the border is no longer an option snow decided to upgrade his visa so that he could stay .
but it was the beginning of a long and arduous paper chase .
a web site set up to help ex-pats was of no use , as was a trip to the czech consulate in dresden , germany to try to get his visa changed .
eventually , he had to hire an expert to help him through the bureaucratic maze .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " permanent tourists " risk run-ins with czech authorities " i would never try to do this on my own , " snow said .
" get an agent is all i can say . "
snow paid the equivalent of 190 euros -lrb- $ 279 -rrb- to sort out his situation .
the need of ex-pats for assistance in dealing with immigration officials has created a business opportunity for native czechs .
" we have got about twice as much interest as we did at this time last year , " visa-enabling agent nora vinduskova told afp .
vinduskova said her clients also included people from australia , canada , japan and thailand .
in the end , snow got what he wanted , but the clock is ticking fast for some other members of prague vibrant ex-pat community . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

communist east germany was , they believed , a joyless dictatorship where people could only dream of owning a pair of levis or the latest rolling stones record , had to wait for years for the privilege of driving a smoke-belching trabant car , and regularly grassed on their neighbors to the secret police . granted , this might not have been the whole truth .
but 17 years after reunification , young people are equally ill-informed .
only now , they see this chapter in history through rose-tinted spectacles - if they think about it at all . ignored or glossed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers today do n't realize the gdr was a dictatorship when researchers at berlin 's freie universität asked 5000 high school students in four german states including berlin , brandenburg and bavaria to fill out a questionnaire testing their knowledge of pre-1989 germany , they discovered that 66 percent of students in north-rhine westphalia did not even consider the gdr a dictatorship . further misconceptions among 15-17-year-olds today are that communist east germany held democratic elections , that former german chancellor helmut kohl was one of its main politicians and that the allies built the berlin wall .
rents were low , child-care excellent and the environment better looked after than it was in west germany , according to the teenagers . but the gaps in their knowledge are hardly surprising , according to monika deutz-schroeder from the research team . " most of the students complain that the subject is either ignored or glossed over in class , " she said .
" then in the eastern states , teachers tend to put a positive spin on the gdr , either out of political conviction or a lack of awareness . " some teachers , according to deutz-schroeder , know very little about certain aspects of the gdr , such as the fact that it practiced capital punishment or that income scales were far from equal . " we need to see improved teacher training on the subject , " she said . " a cute little country " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum gives people a glimpse of life in the gdr inadequate training is one problem - a lack of interest another . " one obstacle is that east german history - unlike nazism - is seen by most west germans not as shared history but as the history of the east germans only , " deutz-schroeder said . it would be mistaken , however , to hold only the teachers responsible for this skewed view of history . " particularly in the eastern part of the country and eastern berlin , students base their knowledge of the gdr on what their parents say , " explained schroeder .
" some of them idealize the gdr , emphasizing its supposed benefits such as a sense of solidarity , greater social equality and guaranteed employment . " moreover , the movie and television industry often wallows in nostalgic humor . " films such as ' goodbye lenin ' make the gdr look harmless , " she said . " students are left with the impression that it was just a backward , cute little country .
they 'd be better off watching ' the lives of others , " ' she added , referring to the 2006 academy award-winning drama about a stasi officer and the people he spied on . the political is personal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : films like ' goodbye lenin ' romanticize the past covering the uniquely complex range of 20th century german history , however , can be simply too time-consuming . " the subject is on the curriculum , but teachers often devote too much time to the nazi era , the second world war and the post-war period , " deutz-schroeder pointed out . henning schluß , an education expert at berlin 's humboldt university who has developed a core curriculum for teaching gdr history at high school level , agrees that a lack of time is an issue , but believes the problem is basically a more subtle one . " understandably , teachers are reluctant to talk about a phase of history in which they were personally involved , " he said .
" in the former east germany , teachers were under extreme pressure to conform to the ruling ideology .
those who had n't been informers for the secret police were usually able to continue working after reunification .
now they have to apply critical faculties to an era in which they played a more or less uncritical role - or even participated in with active enthusiasm .
they have to come to terms with their own past . " living history ultimately , schluß feels this could be an actual boon to the class . " for teenagers today , the gdr is , literally , history .
they grew up in a reunified germany , which means teachers can discuss the country 's division in the same way they can discuss the thirty years ' war .
it has no immediacy to the students . " there are many germans , however , who have had a first-hand experience with the communist dictatorship .
they are the ones who could paint a vivid picture of what it was really like , back in the gdr . " the great thing is that young people have the opportunity to benefit from eye-witness accounts - which they do n't have when they 're learning about the thirty years ' war , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2007 europe without borders threatens ex-pats without visas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-pats in the czech republic will be subject to schengen-wide rules as of 2008 , the czech republic will join the schengen agreement , meaning that people with right papers can travel freely to most other eu nations .
but that 's created a hassle for one prominent subculture in prague . ever since the fall of communism , the czech capital prague has been a magnet for young americans .
the rents were cheap , the beer was good , and ex-pats needed only to hop across the border every three months to renew their status as " tourists . "
but that situation is set to change on jan .
1 , when the czech republic , together with eight other newer eu members , becomes party to the schengen agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are lots of reasons to want to stay in prague ex-pats will now have to depart the schengen zone - the nearest countries being switzerland , ukraine and romania - in order to officially leave the czech republic .
and tourist visas will only permit holders to reside within the zone for three months in any six-month period .
the us embassy estimates the number of " yappies " -lrb- young americans in prague -rrb- to be around 5,000 , but the actual figure may be far higher .
the approach of schengen has caused those , who never bothered getting the proper paperwork to feel very skittish .
" i was afraid i might have to leave the country , or at least go away for a time , " long-term ex-pat eric snow told the afp news agency .
new cottage industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of jan .
1 , a quick drive across the border is no longer an option snow decided to upgrade his visa so that he could stay .
but it was the beginning of a long and arduous paper chase .
a web site set up to help ex-pats was of no use , as was a trip to the czech consulate in dresden , germany to try to get his visa changed .
eventually , he had to hire an expert to help him through the bureaucratic maze .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " permanent tourists " risk run-ins with czech authorities " i would never try to do this on my own , " snow said .
" get an agent is all i can say . "
snow paid the equivalent of 190 euros -lrb- $ 279 -rrb- to sort out his situation .
the need of ex-pats for assistance in dealing with immigration officials has created a business opportunity for native czechs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 16.12.2007 alpine tourism 's melting prospects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll follow the snow snow-covered mountains are the main tourist draw in the alps .
climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans open their presents on dec .
24 ideas for this special " countdown " calendar with little doors to open first began circulating at the start of the 20th century .
it used to be that opening a door would reveal a little picture that was slightly transparent .
that way , you could put your calendar in a window or in front of a candle , mark-zobel said .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .

tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .

instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2007 europe without borders threatens ex-pats without visas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-pats in the czech republic will be subject to schengen-wide rules as of 2008 , the czech republic will join the schengen agreement , meaning that people with right papers can travel freely to most other eu nations .
but that 's created a hassle for one prominent subculture in prague . ever since the fall of communism , the czech capital prague has been a magnet for young americans .
the rents were cheap , the beer was good , and ex-pats needed only to hop across the border every three months to renew their status as " tourists . "
but that situation is set to change on jan .
1 , when the czech republic , together with eight other newer eu members , becomes party to the schengen agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are lots of reasons to want to stay in prague ex-pats will now have to depart the schengen zone - the nearest countries being switzerland , ukraine and romania - in order to officially leave the czech republic .
and tourist visas will only permit holders to reside within the zone for three months in any six-month period .
the us embassy estimates the number of " yappies " -lrb- young americans in prague -rrb- to be around 5,000 , but the actual figure may be far higher .
the approach of schengen has caused those , who never bothered getting the proper paperwork to feel very skittish .
" i was afraid i might have to leave the country , or at least go away for a time , " long-term ex-pat eric snow told the afp news agency .
new cottage industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of jan .
1 , a quick drive across the border is no longer an option snow decided to upgrade his visa so that he could stay .
but it was the beginning of a long and arduous paper chase .
a web site set up to help ex-pats was of no use , as was a trip to the czech consulate in dresden , germany to try to get his visa changed .
eventually , he had to hire an expert to help him through the bureaucratic maze .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " permanent tourists " risk run-ins with czech authorities " i would never try to do this on my own , " snow said .
" get an agent is all i can say . "
snow paid the equivalent of 190 euros -lrb- $ 279 -rrb- to sort out his situation .
the need of ex-pats for assistance in dealing with immigration officials has created a business opportunity for native czechs .
" we have got about twice as much interest as we did at this time last year , " visa-enabling agent nora vinduskova told afp .
vinduskova said her clients also included people from australia , canada , japan and thailand .
in the end , snow got what he wanted , but the clock is ticking fast for some other members of prague vibrant ex-pat community . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .

he turned out to be right - but young people 's ignorance of the not-so-distant past is now a cause for concern to education experts . cold war rhetoric was mother 's milk to most people over 30 today .
raised in a country spliced into two by the iron curtain , west germans grew up with the specter of the big red menace .
communist east germany was , they believed , a joyless dictatorship where people could only dream of owning a pair of levis or the latest rolling stones record , had to wait for years for the privilege of driving a smoke-belching trabant car , and regularly grassed on their neighbors to the secret police . granted , this might not have been the whole truth .

" then in the eastern states , teachers tend to put a positive spin on the gdr , either out of political conviction or a lack of awareness .

he turned out to be right - but young people 's ignorance of the not-so-distant past is now a cause for concern to education experts . cold war rhetoric was mother 's milk to most people over 30 today .
raised in a country spliced into two by the iron curtain , west germans grew up with the specter of the big red menace .
communist east germany was , they believed , a joyless dictatorship where people could only dream of owning a pair of levis or the latest rolling stones record , had to wait for years for the privilege of driving a smoke-belching trabant car , and regularly grassed on their neighbors to the secret police . granted , this might not have been the whole truth .
but 17 years after reunification , young people are equally ill-informed .
only now , they see this chapter in history through rose-tinted spectacles - if they think about it at all . ignored or glossed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers today do n't realize the gdr was a dictatorship when researchers at berlin 's freie universität asked 5000 high school students in four german states including berlin , brandenburg and bavaria to fill out a questionnaire testing their knowledge of pre-1989 germany , they discovered that 66 percent of students in north-rhine westphalia did not even consider the gdr a dictatorship . further misconceptions among 15-17-year-olds today are that communist east germany held democratic elections , that former german chancellor helmut kohl was one of its main politicians and that the allies built the berlin wall .
rents were low , child-care excellent and the environment better looked after than it was in west germany , according to the teenagers . but the gaps in their knowledge are hardly surprising , according to monika deutz-schroeder from the research team . " most of the students complain that the subject is either ignored or glossed over in class , " she said .
" then in the eastern states , teachers tend to put a positive spin on the gdr , either out of political conviction or a lack of awareness . " some teachers , according to deutz-schroeder , know very little about certain aspects of the gdr , such as the fact that it practiced capital punishment or that income scales were far from equal . " we need to see improved teacher training on the subject , " she said . " a cute little country " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum gives people a glimpse of life in the gdr inadequate training is one problem - a lack of interest another . " one obstacle is that east german history - unlike nazism - is seen by most west germans not as shared history but as the history of the east germans only , " deutz-schroeder said . it would be mistaken , however , to hold only the teachers responsible for this skewed view of history . " particularly in the eastern part of the country and eastern berlin , students base their knowledge of the gdr on what their parents say , " explained schroeder .
" some of them idealize the gdr , emphasizing its supposed benefits such as a sense of solidarity , greater social equality and guaranteed employment . " moreover , the movie and television industry often wallows in nostalgic humor . " films such as ' goodbye lenin ' make the gdr look harmless , " she said . " students are left with the impression that it was just a backward , cute little country .
they 'd be better off watching ' the lives of others , " ' she added , referring to the 2006 academy award-winning drama about a stasi officer and the people he spied on . the political is personal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : films like ' goodbye lenin ' romanticize the past covering the uniquely complex range of 20th century german history , however , can be simply too time-consuming . " the subject is on the curriculum , but teachers often devote too much time to the nazi era , the second world war and the post-war period , " deutz-schroeder pointed out . henning schluß , an education expert at berlin 's humboldt university who has developed a core curriculum for teaching gdr history at high school level , agrees that a lack of time is an issue , but believes the problem is basically a more subtle one . " understandably , teachers are reluctant to talk about a phase of history in which they were personally involved , " he said .
" in the former east germany , teachers were under extreme pressure to conform to the ruling ideology .
those who had n't been informers for the secret police were usually able to continue working after reunification .
now they have to apply critical faculties to an era in which they played a more or less uncritical role - or even participated in with active enthusiasm .
they have to come to terms with their own past . " living history ultimately , schluß feels this could be an actual boon to the class . " for teenagers today , the gdr is , literally , history .
they grew up in a reunified germany , which means teachers can discuss the country 's division in the same way they can discuss the thirty years ' war .
it has no immediacy to the students . " there are many germans , however , who have had a first-hand experience with the communist dictatorship .
they are the ones who could paint a vivid picture of what it was really like , back in the gdr . " the great thing is that young people have the opportunity to benefit from eye-witness accounts - which they do n't have when they 're learning about the thirty years ' war , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans open their presents on dec .
24 ideas for this special " countdown " calendar with little doors to open first began circulating at the start of the 20th century .
it used to be that opening a door would reveal a little picture that was slightly transparent .
that way , you could put your calendar in a window or in front of a candle , mark-zobel said .
" and when there were no more doors left to open , then you knew ' thank goodness , tonight is christmas mass , and afterwards we get our presents ! " ' dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans open their presents on dec .
24 ideas for this special " countdown " calendar with little doors to open first began circulating at the start of the 20th century .
it used to be that opening a door would reveal a little picture that was slightly transparent .
that way , you could put your calendar in a window or in front of a candle , mark-zobel said .
" and when there were no more doors left to open , then you knew ' thank goodness , tonight is christmas mass , and afterwards we get our presents ! " ' dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but where do all these customs come from , and what do they actually signify ? every german child knows the rhyme that begins " advent , advent , ein lichtlein brennt … " -lrb- advent , advent , a light is burning -rrb- .
it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

it 's about the advent wreath , typically fashioned out of pine branches and featuring four candles .
on each of the four sundays leading up to christmas , an additional candle is lit , until all four are aglow .
they symbolize the light brought into the world by the birth of jesus christ .
it 's a classic part of the advent season that many see as very old and traditional , but in fact , the tradition of the advent wreath only dates back to 1838 , according to tour guide angelika mark-zobel , who leads people on advent tours in the western german city of cologne .
" there was a protestant pastor who , on the evenings during advent , would read the bibel with groups of craftspeople in northern germany , and he would light a candle for each of these evenings until he had 25 candles lit , " mark-zobel explained .
" but this became very expensive . "
according to the story , the following year he only lit a candle to mark each sunday evening .
mixture of protestant and catholic customs the custom swiftly caught on in the protestant church .
the wreath of candles spread first to parishes , then orphanages and schools , and later , private homes .
after world war ii , this protestant custom also became popular among catholics .
typically , protestant and catholic christians borrowed from each others ' advent and christmas traditions , and over time , even developed common rituals , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creche depicts the birth of jesus " through this fusion , where catholics and protestants were living together in cities and in the country , the customs also started to mix , " she said .
" now you see the advent lights in every office , in every shop . "
just as the catholics took on the protestants ' advent wreath , so have protestants warmed to the catholic custom of setting up a christmas creche .
using figures to create a scene of jesus ' birth has been a tradition since the 13th century .
until the 19th century , the creche was the centerpiece of the familial christmas celebration , until it was somewhat pushed aside by the christmas tree - originally a protestant custom .
christmas trees for the rich at first , christmas trees appeared mainly in the homes of wealthy families and nobility .
in the 19th century , however , they became a common sight in the homes of well-to-do middle class families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , kids get a visit from st. nick on dec .
6 " perhaps the christmas tree first had 33 candles because christ lived for 33 years , " mark-zobel said .
" eventually , baubles were added , because they reflect the light .
but first and foremost , it is a protestant symbol of the resurrection , for eternal life , for holiness . "
the german " nikolaus " tradition , though , where children wake on dec .
6 to find stockings or shoes filled with gifts and sweets left by st. nicholas , is a catholic custom .
parents can buy the stocking stuffers anywhere nowadays , but the most appropriate place is still one of the traditional christmas markets that spring up in most german towns during advent .
markets supply seasonal treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas markets are a feature of every german city " christmas markets have a long history , one that bears little resemblance with the christmas markets of today , " mark-zobel said .
" the market was a place to buy all the expensive items that you needed to prepare for the festivities - certain spices , for example .
for the cold winter season , you could also find knitted items , or special forms for baking seasonal treats .
that 's the actual background for the christmas market . "
in the weeks leading up to christmas eve , many germans bake christmas cookies in holiday-inspired shapes such as stars , trees , snowmen or wreaths .
but perhaps the most famous christmas treat is stollen .
christians have been baking stollen since the 14th century , mark-zobel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baking shaped christmas cookies is a favorite advent pastime " stollen is a very traditional baked good that has its origins in eastern germany , " she said .
" the form resembles a swaddled newborn - it has a long shape roughly the size of a new baby , around 50 centimeters , with thick layers interspersed with icing sugar and melted butter . "
in order to offer guests and family members something special that was usually only to be had at christmas time , large amounts of expensive candied fruit were added to the batter .
countdown to christmas advent is a time of expectation and anticipation , as well as a time for contemplation and peacefulness .
it 's a time for cozy evenings with family members and friends , for candlelight and special foods , to listen to christmas music or read texts associated with advent .
and for children , there 's an especially fun activity to mark the season - the daily opening of a door in their advent calendar to find a hidden piece of chocolate .

he turned out to be right - but young people 's ignorance of the not-so-distant past is now a cause for concern to education experts . cold war rhetoric was mother 's milk to most people over 30 today .
raised in a country spliced into two by the iron curtain , west germans grew up with the specter of the big red menace .
communist east germany was , they believed , a joyless dictatorship where people could only dream of owning a pair of levis or the latest rolling stones record , had to wait for years for the privilege of driving a smoke-belching trabant car , and regularly grassed on their neighbors to the secret police . granted , this might not have been the whole truth .
but 17 years after reunification , young people are equally ill-informed .
only now , they see this chapter in history through rose-tinted spectacles - if they think about it at all . ignored or glossed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers today do n't realize the gdr was a dictatorship when researchers at berlin 's freie universität asked 5000 high school students in four german states including berlin , brandenburg and bavaria to fill out a questionnaire testing their knowledge of pre-1989 germany , they discovered that 66 percent of students in north-rhine westphalia did not even consider the gdr a dictatorship . further misconceptions among 15-17-year-olds today are that communist east germany held democratic elections , that former german chancellor helmut kohl was one of its main politicians and that the allies built the berlin wall .
rents were low , child-care excellent and the environment better looked after than it was in west germany , according to the teenagers . but the gaps in their knowledge are hardly surprising , according to monika deutz-schroeder from the research team . " most of the students complain that the subject is either ignored or glossed over in class , " she said .
" then in the eastern states , teachers tend to put a positive spin on the gdr , either out of political conviction or a lack of awareness . " some teachers , according to deutz-schroeder , know very little about certain aspects of the gdr , such as the fact that it practiced capital punishment or that income scales were far from equal . " we need to see improved teacher training on the subject , " she said . " a cute little country " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum gives people a glimpse of life in the gdr inadequate training is one problem - a lack of interest another . " one obstacle is that east german history - unlike nazism - is seen by most west germans not as shared history but as the history of the east germans only , " deutz-schroeder said . it would be mistaken , however , to hold only the teachers responsible for this skewed view of history . " particularly in the eastern part of the country and eastern berlin , students base their knowledge of the gdr on what their parents say , " explained schroeder .
" some of them idealize the gdr , emphasizing its supposed benefits such as a sense of solidarity , greater social equality and guaranteed employment . " moreover , the movie and television industry often wallows in nostalgic humor . " films such as ' goodbye lenin ' make the gdr look harmless , " she said . " students are left with the impression that it was just a backward , cute little country .
they 'd be better off watching ' the lives of others , " ' she added , referring to the 2006 academy award-winning drama about a stasi officer and the people he spied on . the political is personal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : films like ' goodbye lenin ' romanticize the past covering the uniquely complex range of 20th century german history , however , can be simply too time-consuming . " the subject is on the curriculum , but teachers often devote too much time to the nazi era , the second world war and the post-war period , " deutz-schroeder pointed out . henning schluß , an education expert at berlin 's humboldt university who has developed a core curriculum for teaching gdr history at high school level , agrees that a lack of time is an issue , but believes the problem is basically a more subtle one . " understandably , teachers are reluctant to talk about a phase of history in which they were personally involved , " he said .
" in the former east germany , teachers were under extreme pressure to conform to the ruling ideology .
those who had n't been informers for the secret police were usually able to continue working after reunification .

climate change will melt away many of the area 's best runs and also threaten to disrupt traditional alpine culture . climate change is already being felt in the alps : the snow line is moving up and snowfall has decreased , shortening the ski season .
glaciers and permafrost are melting , and landslides and floods are increasing .
this spells disaster for alpine communities whose economies depend on tourist dollars .
tourism , the environment and culture are closely linked in the alps , said peter keller , director of tourism for switzerland 's state secretariat for economic affairs .
for example , when local farmers close because there 's no longer a local market for their produce , grazing will stop in alpine meadows , changing the ecosystem .
other types of tourism just ca n't match the affluent skiers who spend big money on lift tickets , gear rental and food , keller said .
yet the alpine ski industry is at risk to climate change and the effects are already being felt .
the search for snow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski tourists spend more money than other types the worst case scenarios for global warming put the decrease in areas with reliable snow coverage at 66 percent .
“ climate is really important to the alps , ” keller told dw-world.de on the sidelines of a recent united nations world tourism organization -lrb- unwto -rrb- meeting held in cartagena , colombia .
“ people will go where there is snow .
it 's very opportunistic . ”
today , there are 699 alpine ski resorts with reliable snow cover .
if the average temperature increases by 4 degrees celsius , only 202 resorts would be able to count on reliable snow , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
of course , it 's possible to make snow artificially .
but this brings its own problems by increasing water and energy consumption , according to an oecd report released this year .
by 2030 , the bernese oberland , one of the “ big five ” tourism regions in switzerland , expects an average winter temperature increase of 1.8 percent .
this will bring an estimated loss of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.7 million -rrb- to the region 's annual turnover .
banks have begun refusing loans to ski resorts under 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,920 feet -rrb- .
tourism : culprit and victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism plays a crucial role in alpine culture , including farming in europe , tourism demand is the highest in three of the continent 's most fragile ecosystems : its coastlines , islands and mountains , according to a report released in october by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- .
alpine regions such as valle d 'aosta in italy and tyrol in austria have the highest number of hotel beds per population , according to the eea .
the un 's tourism organization realizes that tourism is both a victim of climate change and a cause as well , said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the unwto .
most tourists fly or drive to their destinations , emitting carbon dioxide on the way .
it 's estimated that tourism contributes 5 percent of global co2 emissions .
the tourism sector needs to adapt the way it does business and become more environmentally sustainable , lipman said .
this can mean converting to solar power and making sure to protect natural resources . yet skiing is not generally seen as an environmentally-friendly industry .
and as ski resorts look to go higher in search of more snow , there will be additional pressure on the ecosystem .
grooming additional runs reduces slope stability and extending ski areas upwards in search for snow disturbs ecosystems .
a recent study in the italian alps shows a decrease in bird species and diversity in areas where ski runs had been made when compared with adjacent areas .
looking towards the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at lower elevations , snow will become scarce in the alps in october , 400 people gathered in innsbruck , austria to talk about the future of winter tourism in the alps .
there was a general sense that it 's too late for prevention .
instead , countries have to come up with strategies to adapt . one of those might be promoting itself as a summer destination .
the alps will always remain cool compared with southern europe 's coasts .
and that could become an asset in the future .

the record withdrawal of sea ice has been well documented , but the region also hit a number of other firsts .
some ocean temperature measurements were unprecedented , and 2007 also set a new record for melting snow over the greenland ice sheet .
the researchers told a meeting of the american geophysical union that some of the observations had been astonishing . "
in 2007 , we had off-the-charts warming " dr michael steele university of washington " the further you go down this path , the harder it is to get back , " observed don perovich from the us army cold regions research and engineering laboratory .
" things could come back , but basically it 's the fourth quarter and we 're down two touchdowns , " he said , using an analogy from american football .
the big thin the extent of the sea-ice cover fell to a record minimum in september of 4.13 million sq km -lrb- 1.59 million sq miles -rrb- , beating the previous low mark , set in 2005 , by 23 % .
this was well publicised at the time , but some of the other " arctic numbers " have not been so widely reported .
scientists say they demonstrate the step changes in environmental conditions in the northern polar region .
dr perovich himself has a number of ice mass balance buoys dotted around the arctic measuring ice thickness .
one of them , in the beaufort sea , saw a 3.3m-thick -lrb- 130 inches -rrb- slab of perennial sea ice reduced to just half a metre .
the slab lost some 70cm -lrb- 27 inches -rrb- off the top and 2.2m -lrb- 86 inches -rrb- off the bottom .
the ablation on the bottom is five times what one would normally expect .
dr peter wadhams , an expert who studies thickness using sonar data from submarines , called this observation " unprecedented " .
" it 's incredible , amazing , " he told bbc news .
" ice cover ca n't stand that for many years : it 'll all go . "
dr perovich told the meeting : " one of the major concerns is that there 's less ice there than we think .
ice thickness is a really important component in all this . "
warmth from below a big driver behind the melt is the current warmth of the waters in the arctic .
in the summer of 2007 , arctic ocean surface temperatures hit new maximums .
the northwest passage was fully navigable in 2007 diary : northwest passage passage questions answered muds reveal sea ice record ice melt raises tension ice data ' shatters record ' in waters just north of the chukchi sea -lrb- above alaska and eastern siberia -rrb- , sea-surface temperatures -lrb- ssts -rrb- were 3.5c warmer than the historical average and 1.5c warmer than the historical maximum .
ssts of 4c were recorded .
this warming was probably the result of having increasing amounts of open water that readily absorb the sun 's rays , a phenomenon known as the ice-albedo feedback : less ice means less reflection and more absorption , leading to more warming and more melting .
warm waters from the pacific ocean are also flowing into the arctic basin through the bering strait .
" in 2007 , we had off-the-charts warming , " said dr michael steele , from the polar science center , applied physics laboratory at the university of washington .
but it is not just at the surface .
the warmth of atlantic sub-surface waters -lrb- 100-500m down -rrb- that move into the arctic are also in " record territory " , the agu meeting heard .
old snow and this picture is reflected on land , where a new record was set on the greenland ice sheet , with snowmelt for areas above 2,000m observed to be 150 % above the long-term average for the period 1988-2006 .
these high elevation areas melted for 25-30 days longer this year than the observed average in the previous 19 years .
at lower altitudes , the melt was still higher than average by 30 % , but it did not break any record .
this year can be put in fifth place over the observed average , behind 2005 , 2002 , 1998 and 2004 .
dr marco tedesco from the university of maryland and the nasa goddard space flight center said the increased melting was probably the consequence of extremely warm temperatures over the greenland ice sheet .
" another factor which we think might be one of the concurrent causes for the record we observe is the low accumulation -lsb- of snow -rsb- for these areas , " he added .
" low accumulation means that the older snow , which absorbs more solar radiation than young snow , was exposed earlier than previous years , " he added .
regional impacts there has been much talk at the meeting of climate " tipping points " , and , in the case of the arctic , when precisely the ocean will be totally free of ice in summer months .
one group of modellers came to the agu conference with a projection of 2013 .
while a number of scientists thought that date a little early , they said ice-free summers would come sooner than many people thought possible .
" if i could take a different angle on that question , and rather than look at when the last piece of ice goes away , ask ' when does the ice cover change in summer in a way that affects people ? ' , " dr perovich said .
" i think we 're already headed in that direction .
this past year , the northwest passage was open ; there 's more potential for exploration for resources ; we 're already seeing for coastal villages that erosion is a serious problem .
" so , we 're already beginning to see impacts on people that , as the melt continues , will just become more obvious . "

the record withdrawal of sea ice has been well documented , but the region also hit a number of other firsts .
some ocean temperature measurements were unprecedented , and 2007 also set a new record for melting snow over the greenland ice sheet .
the researchers told a meeting of the american geophysical union that some of the observations had been astonishing .
in 2007 , we had off-the-charts warming dr michael steele university of washington " the further you go down this path , the harder it is to get back , " observed don perovich from the us army cold regions research and engineering laboratory .
" things could come back , but basically it 's the fourth quarter and we 're down two touchdowns , " he said , using an analogy from american football .
the big thin the extent of the sea-ice cover fell to a record minimum in september of 4.13 million sq km -lrb- 1.59 million sq miles -rrb- , beating the previous low mark , set in 2005 , by 23 % .
this was well publicised at the time , but some of the other " arctic numbers " have not been so widely reported .
scientists say they demonstrate the step changes in environmental conditions in the northern polar region .
arctic summer melting in 2007 set new records more details dr perovich himself has a number of ice mass balance buoys dotted around the arctic measuring ice thickness .
one of them , in the beaufort sea , saw a 3.3m-thick -lrb- 130 inches -rrb- slab of perennial sea ice reduced to just half a metre .
the slab lost some 70cm -lrb- 27 inches -rrb- off the top and 2.2m -lrb- 86 inches -rrb- off the bottom .
the ablation on the bottom is five times what one would normally expect .
dr peter wadhams , an expert who studies thickness using sonar data from submarines , called this observation " unprecedented " .
" it 's incredible , amazing , " he told bbc news .
" ice cover ca n't stand that for many years : it 'll all go . "
dr perovich told the meeting : " one of the major concerns is that there 's less ice there than we think .
ice thickness is a really important component in all this . "
warmth from below a big driver behind the melt is the current warmth of the waters in the arctic .
in the summer of 2007 , arctic ocean surface temperatures hit new maximums .
the northwest passage was fully navigable in 2007 diary : northwest passage passage questions answered muds reveal sea ice record ice melt raises tension ice data ' shatters record ' in waters just north of the chukchi sea -lrb- above alaska and eastern siberia -rrb- , sea-surface temperatures -lrb- ssts -rrb- were 3.5c warmer than the historical average and 1.5c warmer than the historical maximum .
ssts of 4c were recorded .
this warming was probably the result of having increasing amounts of open water that readily absorb the sun 's rays , a phenomenon known as the ice-albedo feedback : less ice means less reflection and more absorption , leading to more warming and more melting .
warm waters from the pacific ocean are also flowing into the arctic basin through the bering strait .
" in 2007 , we had off-the-charts warming , " said dr michael steele , from the polar science center , applied physics laboratory at the university of washington .
but it is not just at the surface .
the warmth of atlantic sub-surface waters -lrb- 100-500m down -rrb- that move into the arctic are also in " record territory " , the agu meeting heard .
old snow and this picture is reflected on land , where a new record was set on the greenland ice sheet , with snowmelt for areas above 2,000m observed to be 150 % above the long-term average for the period 1988-2006 .
these high elevation areas melted for 25-30 days longer this year than the observed average in the previous 19 years .
at lower altitudes , the melt was still higher than average by 30 % , but it did not break any record .
this year can be put in fifth place over the observed average , behind 2005 , 2002 , 1998 and 2004 .
dr marco tedesco from the university of maryland and the nasa goddard space flight center said the increased melting was probably the consequence of extremely warm temperatures over the greenland ice sheet .
" another factor which we think might be one of the concurrent causes for the record we observe is the low accumulation -lsb- of snow -rsb- for these areas , " he added .
" low accumulation means that the older snow , which absorbs more solar radiation than young snow , was exposed earlier than previous years , " he added .
regional impacts there has been much talk at the meeting of climate " tipping points " , and , in the case of the arctic , when precisely the ocean will be totally free of ice in summer months .
one group of modellers came to the agu conference with a projection of 2013 .
while a number of scientists thought that date a little early , they said ice-free summers would come sooner than many people thought possible .
" if i could take a different angle on that question , and rather than look at when the last piece of ice goes away , ask ' when does the ice cover change in summer in a way that affects people ? ' , " dr perovich said .
" i think we 're already headed in that direction .
this past year , the northwest passage was open ; there 's more potential for exploration for resources ; we 're already seeing for coastal villages that erosion is a serious problem .
" so , we 're already beginning to see impacts on people that , as the melt continues , will just become more obvious . "

in the end , it all went as well as anyone could have hoped .
performing together on home soil for the first time in almost a decade , the reunited spice girls put on a slick , colourful and energetic display .
apparently untroubled by the sprained ankle that saw her fly into heathrow on crutches , emma bunton did not excuse herself from the group 's fairly undemanding dance routines .
even victoria beckham managed a smile or two - mostly directed at husband david and her three sons , who were seated close to the stage at the former millennium dome .
in their rather underwhelming careers as solo artists , posh , sporty , scary et al seemed keen to discard those reductive nicknames and the iconography that went with them .
now they have reformed for a world tour , however , nostalgia is very much the order of the day .
melanie chisholm 's tracksuit , melanie brown 's leopard-skin outfits and geri halliwell 's union jack skirt have all been dragged out of the closet .
so has the group 's jaunty back catalogue of perky , exuberant and annoyingly catchy pop songs .

it was perhaps revealing , however , that she was the only one of the five not to sing a solo number - treating the audience instead to a tongue-in-cheek march down an imaginary catwalk .
as a group the spice girls were always greater than the sum of their parts .
hardly surprising then , that , these individual turns were the weakest points of the evening .
bunton 's rendition of her retro track maybe was acceptable , while melanie c performed her uk number one i turn to you with gutsy gusto .

for the most part , however , it was hard to fault a show as polished and professional as any the band staged in their ' 90s heyday .
the girls even found an elegant way to acknowledge halliwell 's early departure from the line-up , having her discreetly descend from view as her bandmates sang their geri-less track holler .
and like all good entertainers they left the best to last - a rousing rendition of their debut hit wannabe that had the o2 's capacity crowd on its feet .
yes , the banter felt scripted and the group hug forced .
the spice girls would not have got this far , though , without being able to simulate a convincing facade of unity .
it is their ability to laugh at themselves , however , that might be their most appealing feature - a characteristic typified by geri and mel b 's mock catfight over a ginger wig thrown onto the stage .

" they were as good or even better than they were the first time around , " added her sister katy .
sold out tickets for saturday 's gig , which cost up to £ 75 , sold out in just 38 seconds when they went on sale in october .

fans turned up in replicas of geri 's famous union jack dress the gigs form part of the girl power quintet 's world tour , which kicked off in vancouver earlier this month to broadly positive reviews .
the two-hour show features eight costume changes and a laser-lit stage backed with huge video screens .
alongside songs from their heyday , including wannabe and stop , the set also incorporates solo hits by melanie c , geri halliwell and bunton .
the tour marks the first time the band have performed as a five-piece since a 1998 gig in birmingham , shortly after which halliwell walked out on her bandmates .
bunton hobbled off a plane on crutches when she arrived in the uk on the opening night of the reunion tour , halliwell referred to the incident by amending the lyrics to the band 's debut single , wannabe .

your comments the show was absolutly amazing ! ! !
it was a childhood dream that finally came true ! !
i hope they do n't stop there and make a new album ! !
they were great ! !
kirsty , essex why so much fuss about these five girls , none of them has got any musical talent at all and none of them is a really good singer .
there is so much real talent out there that does not get a chance .
media hype in fact is killing real talent and musical culture .
e. hagen , london uk i felt like i was nine or ten again !
it was so nice to see them altogether again and hearing all the old hits .
it was amazing , and well worth the ticket price .
lauren , wickford , uk i 'm 15 and it was absolutly amazing !
i enjoyed it so much !
amazing atmosphere .
i 'd recomend it to anyone !
georgia , langford they were miming and rubbish the first time round , and they are miming and rubbish this time round .
does the phrase " we are only in it for the money " spring to mind ?
paul williams , taunton what an amazing show , the sets , costumes , dancers and of course the spice girls were fantastic .
if i could get tickets and go again in the uk i would .
lets hope and pray they release the concert on a live dvd .
neil , bristol it was absolutely fantastic .
the costumes were great , the lighting was fab and the band was brilliant .
the solo songs were all great too and the atmosphere was electric .
i also thought that it was lovely that david , the boys and friends and family of the girls were sat in with the crowd and they made no fuss at all about being photographed .
it was definitely worth it .
thanks girls !
laura elliott , bishops tachbrook , warwickshire what an amazing night it was last night !
i dont think i have ever been to a concert with atmosphere like that - just the anticipation of the girls arriving on stage sent the audience into raptures .
it was so great to relive all the old songs - when the whole audience knew all the words , the noise levels rose as everyone joined in and it added a special something to the whole experience .
everyone left on a massive high - just an absolutely brilliant occasion - not to be forgotten .
and i am an aging 46 year old - not some screaming teenager - although i felt a bit like one again last night ! !
tricia prior , reading , uk .
i think the spice girls were good last night , their encore was excellent .
however they looked uncomfortable on stage and the sound qality was very poor in the upper level of the arena .
take that last week were so much better !
katie rothenberg , london i thought they were phenomenal , totally worth the wait. victoria looked absolutely gorgeous .
i hope they decide to stick it out and do another album and a few more concerts .
i would love to do it all again and go see them .
lynette haselip , corby , northants it was much better than what i had expected especially after seeing their first ever concert at wembley 10 + years back .
the ladies brought back " girl power " to everybody at the o2 and they still have got what it takes to entertain .
totally made in britain - spice up your life ! ! !
sandy , london the spice girls were fantastic tonight , even better than we remembered !
emma did a fantastic job of moving around the stage considering she 'd hurt her ankle .
it was great !
bring out another album please .

i dont think i have ever been to a concert with atmosphere like that - just the anticipation of the girls arriving on stage sent the audience into raptures .
it was so great to relive all the old songs - when the whole audience knew all the words , the noise levels rose as everyone joined in and it added a special something to the whole experience .
everyone left on a massive high - just an absolutely brilliant occasion - not to be forgotten .

georgia , langford they were miming and rubbish the first time round , and they are miming and rubbish this time round .

paul williams , taunton what an amazing show , the sets , costumes , dancers and of course the spice girls were fantastic .

lets hope and pray they release the concert on a live dvd .
neil , bristol it was absolutely fantastic .
the costumes were great , the lighting was fab and the band was brilliant .
the solo songs were all great too and the atmosphere was electric .
i also thought that it was lovely that david , the boys and friends and family of the girls were sat in with the crowd and they made no fuss at all about being photographed .
it was definitely worth it .
thanks girls !
laura elliott , bishops tachbrook , warwickshire what an amazing night it was last night !
i dont think i have ever been to a concert with atmosphere like that - just the anticipation of the girls arriving on stage sent the audience into raptures .
it was so great to relive all the old songs - when the whole audience knew all the words , the noise levels rose as everyone joined in and it added a special something to the whole experience .
everyone left on a massive high - just an absolutely brilliant occasion - not to be forgotten .
and i am an aging 46 year old - not some screaming teenager - although i felt a bit like one again last night ! !
tricia prior , reading , uk .
i think the spice girls were good last night , their encore was excellent .
however they looked uncomfortable on stage and the sound qality was very poor in the upper level of the arena .
take that last week were so much better !
katie rothenberg , london i thought they were phenomenal , totally worth the wait. victoria looked absolutely gorgeous .
i hope they decide to stick it out and do another album and a few more concerts .

lynette haselip , corby , northants it was much better than what i had expected especially after seeing their first ever concert at wembley 10 + years back .
the ladies brought back " girl power " to everybody at the o2 and they still have got what it takes to entertain .
totally made in britain - spice up your life ! ! !
sandy , london the spice girls were fantastic tonight , even better than we remembered !
emma did a fantastic job of moving around the stage considering she 'd hurt her ankle .

" do you believe in santa claus ? " the 59-year-old asked before he launched into the song , a chart hit in 1985 and a festive airplay favourite ever since .
the gig , at belfast 's odyssey arena , is one of only two uk shows scheduled for springsteen 's 2007 world tour .
he will play his final show of the year at london 's o2 arena on wednesday .
the current world tour marks the first time in almost five years that the blue-collar rocker has played live with the e street band .
in an energetic two-and-a-half hour set in belfast , springsteen delivered hits like born to run and dancing in the dark alongside tracks from his latest album , magic .
the record , which went to number one in october , includes lyrics which lash out at the war in iraq .
introducing the album 's title track , springsteen said : " in my country today the truth has become lies and the lies have become the truth and that 's the magic . "
on a less political note , he dedicated i 'll work for your love to a couple in the audience who had come to the show from their wedding - still dressed in their outfits .
springsteen recently revealed plans to bring his tour back to europe in 2008 for a series of stadium shows .
among them are three uk dates - at manchester old trafford on 28 may , london 's emirates stadium on 30 may , and cardiff 's millennium stadium on 14 june .
the rock star will also play three nights at dublin 's rds arena in may .
