" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .

even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .

but starting jan .
1 , smoking here is set to get much more difficult . for a very long time , to brunch , lunch or dine out in german eateries has been to do so in a fug of tobacco smoke .
bars and restaurants have resisted the idea of creating non-smoking zones and have steered clear of contemplating the unthinkable - implementing an all out ban .
but this year , once the smog from several days of new year firecrackers finally clears , the air over germany should be altogether purer and sweeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to quit ?
throughout the course of the year , bans are set to come into force in every state which does not already have one , although several regions , such as north rhine-westphalia and thuringia , have decided to give their smokers a grace period in which to adjust to the idea of breathing healthier air .
and while eight states , including hamburg , schleswig-holstein , berlin and bavaria , will make their smokers stub out from the first day of the year , voices of dissent can already be heard from restaurant and bar owners .
berlin bar-owners plan to flout the new law klaus-dieter richter , vice president of the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says there is every likelihood that many of berlin 's 6,500 bar , café , restaurant and club owners who hang " no smoking " signs in their windows will not actively enforce the ban on the grounds that they can not be punished for it until july 1 . at that point smokers can expect to be fined up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- and proprieters up to 1,000 euros .
richter says the new ruling will damage the capital 's flourishing tourist industry .
" it will kill the berlin culture of a beer , a schnapps and a cigarette at a local bar , " he told the daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more smoking at the bar as in mecklenburg-western pomerania , hamburg , schleswig-hostein , bremen and brandenburg , berlin bar and restaurant-goers will still be able to smoke in establishments which have a second , smaller room sealed off from the main area . but richter says some 80 percent of all bars and restaurants in berlin only have one room , and very few have gone to the lengths of installing a dividing wall to create the prerequisite second .
even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but starting jan .
1 , smoking here is set to get much more difficult . for a very long time , to brunch , lunch or dine out in german eateries has been to do so in a fug of tobacco smoke .
bars and restaurants have resisted the idea of creating non-smoking zones and have steered clear of contemplating the unthinkable - implementing an all out ban .
but this year , once the smog from several days of new year firecrackers finally clears , the air over germany should be altogether purer and sweeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to quit ?
throughout the course of the year , bans are set to come into force in every state which does not already have one , although several regions , such as north rhine-westphalia and thuringia , have decided to give their smokers a grace period in which to adjust to the idea of breathing healthier air .
and while eight states , including hamburg , schleswig-holstein , berlin and bavaria , will make their smokers stub out from the first day of the year , voices of dissent can already be heard from restaurant and bar owners .
berlin bar-owners plan to flout the new law klaus-dieter richter , vice president of the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says there is every likelihood that many of berlin 's 6,500 bar , café , restaurant and club owners who hang " no smoking " signs in their windows will not actively enforce the ban on the grounds that they can not be punished for it until july 1 . at that point smokers can expect to be fined up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- and proprieters up to 1,000 euros .
richter says the new ruling will damage the capital 's flourishing tourist industry .
" it will kill the berlin culture of a beer , a schnapps and a cigarette at a local bar , " he told the daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more smoking at the bar as in mecklenburg-western pomerania , hamburg , schleswig-hostein , bremen and brandenburg , berlin bar and restaurant-goers will still be able to smoke in establishments which have a second , smaller room sealed off from the main area . but richter says some 80 percent of all bars and restaurants in berlin only have one room , and very few have gone to the lengths of installing a dividing wall to create the prerequisite second .
even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dozens have been killed in violence that has convulsed the country in the wake of the election . " the tallying process lacks credibility and despite the best efforts the electoral commission of kenya -lrb- eck -rrb- has not fulfilled its responsibilities to create such a process , " said alexander graf lambsdorff , the 150-member eu mission 's chief observer , on sunday , dec .
30 , in an interview with reuters . the eu had initially hailed thursday 's peaceful presidential and parliamentary elections , and some initially held up the exercise as an example for the volatile continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kibaki was sworn in an hour after he was declared the winner " however , once polling stations closed and the tallying began ... we encountered some irregularities that cast a doubt on the accuracy of the final results that were announced this afternoon , " lambsdorff said . the eck declared mwai kibaki the winner of the election on sunday , and he was sworn in for a second-five year term an hour later .
but defeated opposition candidate raila odinga and his orange democratic movement have disputed the polls , charging that any kibaki win was due to vote rigging .

clashes between protesters and police on sunday night led to dozens of deaths in slums in the capital , nairobi , and other parts of the country .

according to the official tally , he garnered 4.35 million votes , 230,000 less than kibaki . " there is no difference between him and idi amin and other military dictators who have seized power through the barrel of the gun , " odinga said of kibaki at a news conference on monday . the eu 's lambsdorff said there had been problems in polling stations , and that there were even greater issues in district capitals , where the ballots were counted . he added that results were particularly questionable in kibaki 's home province , where extraordinarily high voter participation - up to 98 percent in some places - was registered . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bars and restaurants have resisted the idea of creating non-smoking zones and have steered clear of contemplating the unthinkable - implementing an all out ban .
but this year , once the smog from several days of new year firecrackers finally clears , the air over germany should be altogether purer and sweeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to quit ?
throughout the course of the year , bans are set to come into force in every state which does not already have one , although several regions , such as north rhine-westphalia and thuringia , have decided to give their smokers a grace period in which to adjust to the idea of breathing healthier air .
and while eight states , including hamburg , schleswig-holstein , berlin and bavaria , will make their smokers stub out from the first day of the year , voices of dissent can already be heard from restaurant and bar owners .
berlin bar-owners plan to flout the new law klaus-dieter richter , vice president of the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says there is every likelihood that many of berlin 's 6,500 bar , café , restaurant and club owners who hang " no smoking " signs in their windows will not actively enforce the ban on the grounds that they can not be punished for it until july 1 . at that point smokers can expect to be fined up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- and proprieters up to 1,000 euros .
richter says the new ruling will damage the capital 's flourishing tourist industry .
" it will kill the berlin culture of a beer , a schnapps and a cigarette at a local bar , " he told the daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more smoking at the bar as in mecklenburg-western pomerania , hamburg , schleswig-hostein , bremen and brandenburg , berlin bar and restaurant-goers will still be able to smoke in establishments which have a second , smaller room sealed off from the main area . but richter says some 80 percent of all bars and restaurants in berlin only have one room , and very few have gone to the lengths of installing a dividing wall to create the prerequisite second .
even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" reviving old prejudices " a criminal complaint has been filed by the group against ndr , the network that produced the program , accusing it of incitement to racial hatred . " it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community . "
herres said the film had opened up a can of worms which was " absolutely not what we wanted , " adding that the incest storyline was an " individual tragedy , " not to be confused with any " religious context , " and which could not be " generalised . " he added that the alevis should " respect artistic liberty " and " withdraw their accusation of racial defamation , an accusation totally unfounded . " alevis , considered by some to be a sub-group of shiite islam , worship in assembly houses instead of mosques .
around 20 percent of muslims in turkey are alevis and an estimated 700,000 reside in germany . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said .

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention .

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" reviving old prejudices " a criminal complaint has been filed by the group against ndr , the network that produced the program , accusing it of incitement to racial hatred . " it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community . "
herres said the film had opened up a can of worms which was " absolutely not what we wanted , " adding that the incest storyline was an " individual tragedy , " not to be confused with any " religious context , " and which could not be " generalised . " he added that the alevis should " respect artistic liberty " and " withdraw their accusation of racial defamation , an accusation totally unfounded . " alevis , considered by some to be a sub-group of shiite islam , worship in assembly houses instead of mosques .
around 20 percent of muslims in turkey are alevis and an estimated 700,000 reside in germany . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dozens have been killed in violence that has convulsed the country in the wake of the election . " the tallying process lacks credibility and despite the best efforts the electoral commission of kenya -lrb- eck -rrb- has not fulfilled its responsibilities to create such a process , " said alexander graf lambsdorff , the 150-member eu mission 's chief observer , on sunday , dec .
30 , in an interview with reuters . the eu had initially hailed thursday 's peaceful presidential and parliamentary elections , and some initially held up the exercise as an example for the volatile continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kibaki was sworn in an hour after he was declared the winner " however , once polling stations closed and the tallying began ... we encountered some irregularities that cast a doubt on the accuracy of the final results that were announced this afternoon , " lambsdorff said . the eck declared mwai kibaki the winner of the election on sunday , and he was sworn in for a second-five year term an hour later .
but defeated opposition candidate raila odinga and his orange democratic movement have disputed the polls , charging that any kibaki win was due to vote rigging .

" there is no difference between him and idi amin and other military dictators who have seized power through the barrel of the gun , " odinga said of kibaki at a news conference on monday . the eu 's lambsdorff said there had been problems in polling stations , and that there were even greater issues in district capitals , where the ballots were counted . he added that results were particularly questionable in kibaki 's home province , where extraordinarily high voter participation - up to 98 percent in some places - was registered . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" reviving old prejudices " a criminal complaint has been filed by the group against ndr , the network that produced the program , accusing it of incitement to racial hatred . " it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community . "
herres said the film had opened up a can of worms which was " absolutely not what we wanted , " adding that the incest storyline was an " individual tragedy , " not to be confused with any " religious context , " and which could not be " generalised . " he added that the alevis should " respect artistic liberty " and " withdraw their accusation of racial defamation , an accusation totally unfounded . " alevis , considered by some to be a sub-group of shiite islam , worship in assembly houses instead of mosques .

a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but starting jan .
1 , smoking here is set to get much more difficult . for a very long time , to brunch , lunch or dine out in german eateries has been to do so in a fug of tobacco smoke .
bars and restaurants have resisted the idea of creating non-smoking zones and have steered clear of contemplating the unthinkable - implementing an all out ban .
but this year , once the smog from several days of new year firecrackers finally clears , the air over germany should be altogether purer and sweeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to quit ?
throughout the course of the year , bans are set to come into force in every state which does not already have one , although several regions , such as north rhine-westphalia and thuringia , have decided to give their smokers a grace period in which to adjust to the idea of breathing healthier air .
and while eight states , including hamburg , schleswig-holstein , berlin and bavaria , will make their smokers stub out from the first day of the year , voices of dissent can already be heard from restaurant and bar owners .
berlin bar-owners plan to flout the new law klaus-dieter richter , vice president of the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says there is every likelihood that many of berlin 's 6,500 bar , café , restaurant and club owners who hang " no smoking " signs in their windows will not actively enforce the ban on the grounds that they can not be punished for it until july 1 . at that point smokers can expect to be fined up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- and proprieters up to 1,000 euros .
richter says the new ruling will damage the capital 's flourishing tourist industry .
" it will kill the berlin culture of a beer , a schnapps and a cigarette at a local bar , " he told the daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more smoking at the bar as in mecklenburg-western pomerania , hamburg , schleswig-hostein , bremen and brandenburg , berlin bar and restaurant-goers will still be able to smoke in establishments which have a second , smaller room sealed off from the main area . but richter says some 80 percent of all bars and restaurants in berlin only have one room , and very few have gone to the lengths of installing a dividing wall to create the prerequisite second .
even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .

" it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community . "
herres said the film had opened up a can of worms which was " absolutely not what we wanted , " adding that the incest storyline was an " individual tragedy , " not to be confused with any " religious context , " and which could not be " generalised . " he added that the alevis should " respect artistic liberty " and " withdraw their accusation of racial defamation , an accusation totally unfounded . " alevis , considered by some to be a sub-group of shiite islam , worship in assembly houses instead of mosques .
around 20 percent of muslims in turkey are alevis and an estimated 700,000 reside in germany . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .

poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .

property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .

" it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community . "
herres said the film had opened up a can of worms which was " absolutely not what we wanted , " adding that the incest storyline was an " individual tragedy , " not to be confused with any " religious context , " and which could not be " generalised . " he added that the alevis should " respect artistic liberty " and " withdraw their accusation of racial defamation , an accusation totally unfounded . " alevis , considered by some to be a sub-group of shiite islam , worship in assembly houses instead of mosques .
around 20 percent of muslims in turkey are alevis and an estimated 700,000 reside in germany . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and while eight states , including hamburg , schleswig-holstein , berlin and bavaria , will make their smokers stub out from the first day of the year , voices of dissent can already be heard from restaurant and bar owners .
berlin bar-owners plan to flout the new law klaus-dieter richter , vice president of the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says there is every likelihood that many of berlin 's 6,500 bar , café , restaurant and club owners who hang " no smoking " signs in their windows will not actively enforce the ban on the grounds that they can not be punished for it until july 1 . at that point smokers can expect to be fined up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- and proprieters up to 1,000 euros .
richter says the new ruling will damage the capital 's flourishing tourist industry .
" it will kill the berlin culture of a beer , a schnapps and a cigarette at a local bar , " he told the daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more smoking at the bar as in mecklenburg-western pomerania , hamburg , schleswig-hostein , bremen and brandenburg , berlin bar and restaurant-goers will still be able to smoke in establishments which have a second , smaller room sealed off from the main area . but richter says some 80 percent of all bars and restaurants in berlin only have one room , and very few have gone to the lengths of installing a dividing wall to create the prerequisite second .
even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .

in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .

" reviving old prejudices " a criminal complaint has been filed by the group against ndr , the network that produced the program , accusing it of incitement to racial hatred . " it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community .

" despite all our successes we may , under no circumstances , sit back , " merkel said , according to a transcript of the speech to be broadcast later on monday , dec 31 . " the risks for our economy and our growth are too high , especially due to global factors . " fighting joblessness the main goal merkel said germany 's economic situation is " noticeably improving , " emphasizing successes in slashing the number of jobless and getting closer to achieving a balanced budget . germany , she said , had taken a " good step forward " in creating more jobs .
" a million fewer unemployed , a million gainfully employed - who could have thought such a development possible two years ago ? " she said . but , she warned , germany 's figure of 3.5 million unemployed was still too high . merkel said the fight against unemployment remained one of next year 's major goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an economic upswing saw more people getting work this year " that means saving existing jobs while creating conditions in order to generate new ones , " she said . less than two years after spiking to five million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . amid recent signs of weakening economic growth , economists expect the decline in the jobless total to slow in 2008 . spotlight on the family the chancellor 's speech focused on family values and she said the family had " moved back to where it belongs : in the center " of society . in a bid to reverse a falling birth rate , merkel 's coalition government this year introduced a big hike in public subsidies for new parents .
both mothers as well as fathers who now choose to stay at home are also eligible for greater financial support . merkel said there would be more day care options for young children in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been shocked by cases of child neglect and abuse referring to a string of child murders and cases of abuse and neglect of children that have rocked the country in recent months , merkel urged germans to be more alert to such incidents . " we need a culture of closer inspection , not looking away , " said merkel , adding that the state must intervene in cases where parents are overwhelmed with taking care of their children . merkel 's government recently approved a package of measures to allow authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it includes regular health checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases . a boost to germany 's image on the international level , merkel said other nations carefully followed developments in germany and the country 's improved economic performance . germany 's rigor as well as clear values when it comes to representing economic interests and political goals on the world stage is closely watched by others , merkel said . " both have noticeably boosted germany 's image in the world in the past two years , " she added . merkel 's foreign policy has been marked by a public stand on human rights , at times even at the expense of jeopardizing business links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toast of the european circuit - merkel with eu commission president barroso and industry leaders the chancellor spoke of " bigger responsibilities " in a year that saw germany hold both the six-month rotating european presidency and host the g8 summit . germany , she said , had risen up to the challenge by managing to make the eu " capable of action " again . the 27-member bloc agreed on a landmark treaty earlier this month to reform and streamline the eu 's institutions . climate change , a topic that merkel has been vigorously championing , got only a brief mention . " land of opportunity " closer home , merkel said she was hopeful that germany would manage to draw on its old strengths as a land of ideas and of solidarity among people to prove itself in the globalized world . this year , two german scientists won nobel prizes - for chemistry and for physics . " we can feel that germany is again on track to becoming a land of opportunity for everyone , " merkel said , adding that politics would play its part to further reinforce the strengths of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" reviving old prejudices " a criminal complaint has been filed by the group against ndr , the network that produced the program , accusing it of incitement to racial hatred . " it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community . "
herres said the film had opened up a can of worms which was " absolutely not what we wanted , " adding that the incest storyline was an " individual tragedy , " not to be confused with any " religious context , " and which could not be " generalised .

dozens have been killed in violence that has convulsed the country in the wake of the election . " the tallying process lacks credibility and despite the best efforts the electoral commission of kenya -lrb- eck -rrb- has not fulfilled its responsibilities to create such a process , " said alexander graf lambsdorff , the 150-member eu mission 's chief observer , on sunday , dec .

but defeated opposition candidate raila odinga and his orange democratic movement have disputed the polls , charging that any kibaki win was due to vote rigging .

clashes between protesters and police on sunday night led to dozens of deaths in slums in the capital , nairobi , and other parts of the country .

" there is no difference between him and idi amin and other military dictators who have seized power through the barrel of the gun , " odinga said of kibaki at a news conference on monday . the eu 's lambsdorff said there had been problems in polling stations , and that there were even greater issues in district capitals , where the ballots were counted . he added that results were particularly questionable in kibaki 's home province , where extraordinarily high voter participation - up to 98 percent in some places - was registered . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but starting jan .
1 , smoking here is set to get much more difficult . for a very long time , to brunch , lunch or dine out in german eateries has been to do so in a fug of tobacco smoke .
bars and restaurants have resisted the idea of creating non-smoking zones and have steered clear of contemplating the unthinkable - implementing an all out ban .
but this year , once the smog from several days of new year firecrackers finally clears , the air over germany should be altogether purer and sweeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to quit ?
throughout the course of the year , bans are set to come into force in every state which does not already have one , although several regions , such as north rhine-westphalia and thuringia , have decided to give their smokers a grace period in which to adjust to the idea of breathing healthier air .
and while eight states , including hamburg , schleswig-holstein , berlin and bavaria , will make their smokers stub out from the first day of the year , voices of dissent can already be heard from restaurant and bar owners .
berlin bar-owners plan to flout the new law klaus-dieter richter , vice president of the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says there is every likelihood that many of berlin 's 6,500 bar , café , restaurant and club owners who hang " no smoking " signs in their windows will not actively enforce the ban on the grounds that they can not be punished for it until july 1 . at that point smokers can expect to be fined up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- and proprieters up to 1,000 euros .
richter says the new ruling will damage the capital 's flourishing tourist industry .
" it will kill the berlin culture of a beer , a schnapps and a cigarette at a local bar , " he told the daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more smoking at the bar as in mecklenburg-western pomerania , hamburg , schleswig-hostein , bremen and brandenburg , berlin bar and restaurant-goers will still be able to smoke in establishments which have a second , smaller room sealed off from the main area . but richter says some 80 percent of all bars and restaurants in berlin only have one room , and very few have gone to the lengths of installing a dividing wall to create the prerequisite second .
even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .

property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "

" reviving old prejudices " a criminal complaint has been filed by the group against ndr , the network that produced the program , accusing it of incitement to racial hatred . " it is appalling to us that a public and legitimate broadcaster would revive these centuries ' old prejudices , " said ali ertan toprak , the secretary general of the alevi community in germany . alevis say they have been the subject of accusations of incest from sunni muslims over the centuries because they include women and children in their religious rituals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protestors held up a copy of the german constitution members of the alevi community in berlin tried to stop the broadcast of the episode but were unsuccessful . network defends program to answer the complaints , the network reiterated in the opening credits that the program was a work of fiction and in no way intended to harm religious feelings or rekindle prejudices against the alevi community . the episode in question is entitled " to whom honor is due " and dealt with incest and murder within an alevi family living in germany . during the course of the program , investigators discover that a young alevi girl was murdered by her father after she confronted him about impregnating her sister . the writer and director of the program , angelina maccarone , defended the program in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandradio , saying that she in no way intended to offend any religious community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatort is a weekly program that has been running for almost 40 years " it is not hard for me to say that i am incredible sorry , " added maccarone , adding that the response had caught her completely by surprise . volker herres , director of programming at ndr said : " we in no way intended this tatort episode to injure any religious feeling or to substantiate prejudices against a religious community . "
herres said the film had opened up a can of worms which was " absolutely not what we wanted , " adding that the incest storyline was an " individual tragedy , " not to be confused with any " religious context , " and which could not be " generalised . " he added that the alevis should " respect artistic liberty " and " withdraw their accusation of racial defamation , an accusation totally unfounded . " alevis , considered by some to be a sub-group of shiite islam , worship in assembly houses instead of mosques .
around 20 percent of muslims in turkey are alevis and an estimated 700,000 reside in germany . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history .

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dozens have been killed in violence that has convulsed the country in the wake of the election . " the tallying process lacks credibility and despite the best efforts the electoral commission of kenya -lrb- eck -rrb- has not fulfilled its responsibilities to create such a process , " said alexander graf lambsdorff , the 150-member eu mission 's chief observer , on sunday , dec .

but defeated opposition candidate raila odinga and his orange democratic movement have disputed the polls , charging that any kibaki win was due to vote rigging .

the law also permits telephone tapping in certain cases . the bill , which was passed by the german parliament in november and goes into effect on jan .
1 , is meant to aid investigations into terrorism and serious crime . " death of privacy " at a rally monday , dec .
31 , in hamburg , critics and activists held a mock funeral for " the death of privacy . "
police said the demonstration by 200 people was non-violent . in the southern city of karlsruhe , the working party on data retention filed for an urgent injunction to stop the legislation on the grounds that it was " obviously unconstitutional . " the group said the 150-page application against " surveillance without suspicion " was initially filed by eight people but was backed by 30,000 people who had signed petitions . their names would be joined to the suit after processing by a berlin law office , making it the largest such appeal in modern german history . " we are hoping for a quick ruling , " said lawyer meinhard starostik , who leads the group .
but a court spokesman said judges would not attend to the case monday . the activists said they would also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . president approves legislation the new law was further bolstered last week when german president horst köhler gave it his blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler approved the data retention law a spokesman for köhler said on wednesday , dec .
26 , that after intense examination of the law , " there was no reason to believe that it could not be signed because it was unconstitutional . " but critics maintain that it tramples privacy rights and civil liberties , places millions of citizens under general terrorist suspicion and paves the way to a surveillance state . " we 're going to fight for the fact that basic rights do n't go up in smoke along with the new year 's fireworks and then finally disappear when 2008 dawns , " gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week . she added that the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . "
the court in karlsruhe will now have to throw light on whether the " surveillance of millions of people in germany " can be reconciled with the constitution , she said . part of eu directive to fight terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other online surveillance measures have sparked criticism the law is part of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . it allows internet providers and telephone companies to store numbers , dates and durations of phone calls , and , in the case of mobile phones , their location too , as well as ip addresses and e-mail addresses . german police , courts and intelligence agencies must obtain a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data .
the information allows authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact . the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators . worries persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has caused controversy with his anti-terrorism proposals proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november , when the law was passed by the parliament , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was meant to make it easier to prevent possible terrorist attacks and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said . more than necessary but critics remain unconvinced .
german commissioner for data protection peter schaar said that parts of the german law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes . one of the concerns centers on the bill 's provisions that permit the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .
29 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" their expertise would prove helpful , " the president said in the interview on saturday , dec .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's proposal is unlikely to go down well with poland köhler also referred to demands in poland that the president of the german federation of expellees , erika steinbach , be denied a role in what the germans call a " visible sign " to remember the war victims .
the polish side " would surely understand that any matters related to german personalities would have to be decided in germany , " he said .
according to german estimates , some 15 million german speakers were expelled from their homes in the aftermath of the war .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
poland wants joint european museum berlin 's plans to build a memorial to ethnic germans expelled from eastern europe at the end of world war ii remain a strong irritant in german-polish ties .
earlier this month , newly elected polish prime minister donald tusk urged the german government to abandon the plans for the memorial in berlin during a visit to the city to meet with merkel .
at the time , tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
poland fears the planned center might also portray the aggressors as victims .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said .
tusk proposed the germans instead participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of remembering the fate of ethnic germans has strained german-polish ties he has suggested the museum could be located in the polish city of gdansk , where the war began in 1939 .
additional countries , such as israel and russia , could be involved in the planning for the museum .
in the interview with köhler , the german president said he saw no contradiction between the german project and the proposal by tusk for a museum in gdansk .
both facilities could form part of a european network of remembrance that could make a contribution towards reconciliation between the different peoples , he said .
property claims surface again last week , a senior polish diplomat revived another issue that has strained ties between berlin and warsaw , when he called on germany to assume responsibility for possible property claims against poland by german world war ii expellees who fled territory the allies handed over to poland after the war .
" the issue for us is for the german state to take responsibility in a more unequivocal way for all possible claims of german citizens against polish citizens , " wladyslaw bartoszewski said in an interview posted this week on the web site of poland 's commercial tvn24 news channel .
a respected survivor of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and a two-time minister of foreign affairs , bartoszewski was recently nominated a special envoy for delicate foreign affairs matters by poland 's new liberal government .
germany and poland should sign a joint declaration making berlin legally responsible for any compensation claims by germans who left behind property in what became polish territory after world war ii as they fled or were forced out following germany 's defeat , said bartoszewski .
the 85-year old called for a " diplomatic-legal document formulated as a declaration by the two heads of state or two prime ministers . "
german-polish ties on way to recovery threats by german expellees and their heirs to sue poles who took over abandoned german homes or land after the war have set off alarm bells in poland .
repeated pledges by germany not to support any such claims have failed to allay fears among poles worried they could lose their homes .
the polish government has long argued that postwar treaties , drawn up by world war ii allies britain , france , the soviet union and the united states , that handed over german land to poland make impossible any legal recourse for ethnic germans who lost property in the process .
over the last two years , under the leadership of president lech kaczynski and his twin brother , then prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's relations with germany reached their lowest point since the end of communist rule in 1989 .
the pair pursued a conflict-prone nationalist brand of foreign policy which the new liberal government under tusk , who was elected in october , has vowed to transform into a more conciliatory , cooperative style . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but starting jan .
1 , smoking here is set to get much more difficult . for a very long time , to brunch , lunch or dine out in german eateries has been to do so in a fug of tobacco smoke .
bars and restaurants have resisted the idea of creating non-smoking zones and have steered clear of contemplating the unthinkable - implementing an all out ban .
but this year , once the smog from several days of new year firecrackers finally clears , the air over germany should be altogether purer and sweeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to quit ?
throughout the course of the year , bans are set to come into force in every state which does not already have one , although several regions , such as north rhine-westphalia and thuringia , have decided to give their smokers a grace period in which to adjust to the idea of breathing healthier air .
and while eight states , including hamburg , schleswig-holstein , berlin and bavaria , will make their smokers stub out from the first day of the year , voices of dissent can already be heard from restaurant and bar owners .
berlin bar-owners plan to flout the new law klaus-dieter richter , vice president of the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says there is every likelihood that many of berlin 's 6,500 bar , café , restaurant and club owners who hang " no smoking " signs in their windows will not actively enforce the ban on the grounds that they can not be punished for it until july 1 . at that point smokers can expect to be fined up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- and proprieters up to 1,000 euros .
richter says the new ruling will damage the capital 's flourishing tourist industry .
" it will kill the berlin culture of a beer , a schnapps and a cigarette at a local bar , " he told the daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more smoking at the bar as in mecklenburg-western pomerania , hamburg , schleswig-hostein , bremen and brandenburg , berlin bar and restaurant-goers will still be able to smoke in establishments which have a second , smaller room sealed off from the main area . but richter says some 80 percent of all bars and restaurants in berlin only have one room , and very few have gone to the lengths of installing a dividing wall to create the prerequisite second .
even for those establishments which do have a smaller separate room , there is plenty of ground for conflict .
guests who choose to sit in the smoking area will no longer receive table service , but will have to place their orders at the bar . death knell for barkeepers werner link , who runs a two-room bar in the baltic town of greifswald says his customers have already told him they wo n't use his second , smaller room . " my customers come here to watch football and to smoke .
if they 're no longer allowed to smoke , they 'll stay at home . "
link told the ostsee zeitung .
" i might as well just close down . "
the strictest ban is in bavaria , where there is to be no smoking anywhere in bars , restaurants , discotheques and marquees .
the only exception will be for private functions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : penalties are in place for those who violate the laws the penalties for violating the new laws will come into force at different times during 2008 and will vary from state to state .
saxony and mecklenburg are threatening their bar and restaurant owners with fines of up to 5,000 and 10,000 euros respectively , while the maximum penalty in hamburg and thuringia is just 500 euros . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blasts took place on sunday night at entertainment venues in the town of sungai kolok in narathiwat province , as people celebrated the holiday season .
devices exploded at or outside two hotels and a disco , police said .
there are frequent gun and bomb attacks in thailand 's southern-most provinces , where separatist rebels are fighting for an islamic state .
more than 2,500 people have been killed since the violence escalated in 2004 .
two of the 27 people hurt in the blasts suffered serious injuries , police said .
security had been tightened in the region ahead of the new year holiday .
the attacks come exactly a year after a series of blasts hit the thai capital , bangkok .
three people were killed when at least five bombs exploded on new year 's eve in 2006 .
no-one has yet been charged in connection with the attacks , which occurred amid political instability four months after the military seized power .

one is the 33-year-old turkish occupation of much of the north of the island , and the pain that still causes the greek cypriot community .
the second is the cost of living .
a common refrain is that wages just do n't cover the price of goods in the shops - many of which have to be imported .
so when the government announced a few years ago that it was going to join the euro from 1 january , 2008 , many people were worried .
they are a well-travelled lot here , and they knew that people in other countries had complained of price rises when the euro came .
and that played to the cypriots ' worst fears about what would happen on their island .
several opinion polls in early to mid-2007 showed most cypriots feared price rises .
so the government knew it would have to do a very good job of persuading people that the euro would not be responsible for higher costs .
it needed to learn from the mistakes made in other euro-adopting countries .
all inclusive the government realised one way it could do this would be to hammer home into its citizens ' heads the exact conversion rate from the euro to the cypriot pound .
that way , after 1 january people would know if they were being duped into paying more .
hence the action plans .
for the last six months , every retail outlet has had to display prices in both euros and cypriot pounds .
at even the simplest market stall and kebab shop , the card or label will have two figures on it .
most shops have also had to display a poster on the wall , showing a whole long list of conversion values between the two currencies .
more recently , major public buildings in the capital nicosia were then draped with huge tarpaulins showing pictures of the new coins and notes .
in october , the government announced it was going to employ 100 inspectors to monitor the price of goods both before and after the introduction of the new currency .
the country 's consumer association did something similar - and also got retailers to sign up to a fair pricing agreement for when the euro would come in .
from mid-december , every home in the republic was posted a calculator , that automatically converts a euro price into a cyprus pound price .
shock free the government seems to have got its message across .
i took a stroll down ledra street , the main shopping thoroughfare in nicosia .
and most people i spoke to thought retailers would find it difficult now to get away with sneaking in price rises .
they pointed to the huge publicity surrounding the introduction of the new currency , and the bright spotlight shone on the retailers ' behaviour .
pretty much everyone , they said , now knows the conversion rate off by heart - 1.71 euros to the cyprus pound .
even the president of the cyprus ' consumer association , petros markou , says he is pretty untroubled .
" i think people have overcome their fears , " he explains .
" the economy has healthy competition now , so that monopolies and oligopolies find it hard to prevail .
" our economy follows the rules of the free market , of supply and demand .
secondly , cypriots are well-travelled .
they go to greece , and further afield , and are already familiar with using the euro .
it wo n't come as too much of a shock to them . "
that is not to say that cypriots are not worried about price rises in general .
far from it .
it is just they are linked to something different - inflation .
price moves in a pretty unfortunate piece of timing for the authorities , earlier in december they had to announce that year-on-year consumer price inflation rose to 3.5 % in november from 3 % in october . "
our fellow citizens also have to exercise some self-control to keep wage demands within the realms of productivity " michalis sarris , cyprus ' finance minister some individual prices have risen by far more , with healthcare costs climbing by 6.9 % , transport by 6.6 % , and hotels and restaurants by 6.1 % .
the upwards pressure on prices has meant that , at its last very meeting in december , the cypriot central bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 4.5 % .
analysts said that with the introduction of the euro it would have dearly liked to bring the borrowing costs more into line with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- rate of 4 % , but that was not possible .
cypriots are obviously keen at the moment to spend their money , and it does have some benefits .
the economy is growing almost twice as fast as the european average .
but the flip side of higher-than-ideal inflation is hurting business .
alternative efficiencies take zorbas fine foods , one of the biggest private employers on the island , that runs 50 or so shops selling anything from cakes and biscuits to ready meals .
it is expanding into wholesale too , having just won the contract to provide the local mcdonald 's with their buns and cyprus airways with bread rolls .
however , chief financial officer michael michael says the costs of doing business is rising very fast .
" almost all of our products are made of flour , " he explains .
" the wheat price has gone up 100 % in the last year .
so that has hit us a lot . "
at the same time he says the company is wrestling with higher energy , labour and transport costs that are squeezing margins .
" the minimum wage has risen on average 6 % to 8 % each year for the last five years , " he says .
" we try not to pass the increases on to our customers , since our customers are king .
we try to find alternative ways to get efficiencies . "
cyprus is , of course , an island , and is relatively detached from the rest of the eu .
it is nearer lebanon than it is to any other eu state .
so it has to import the vast majority of what it consumes .
at a time when the price many of those goods is rising fast , this affects them more than other more self-sufficient countries .
' self-control ' however , cyprus ' finance minister michalis sarris says a bit of self-discipline will get them through the situation .
" coinciding with , but totally unrelated to the euro , we have strong inflationary pressures , " he explains .
" so we have to be extra careful that our budgetary policy has to be restrictive .
and we are very fortunate that we are already seeing budget surpluses .
" our fellow citizens also have to exercise some self-control to keep wage demands within the realms of productivity . "
the central banker 's favourite tool to rein in inflation - putting up domestic interest rates - is about to be taken away from cyprus .
within the eurozone , it is the ecb that controls borrowing costs for all of countries that use the single european currency .
but the government message is that if wages are realistic and public spending not overly generous , then the island will be able to cope .
the euro is coming at a time when the cyprus economy is growing fast , and its people are spend , spend , spending .
the cypriot authorities will hope that does not all come to a sorry end .
if it does , then the euro , perhaps unfairly , could get a lot of the blame .

one is the 33-year-old turkish occupation of much of the north of the island , and the pain that still causes the greek cypriot community .
the second is the cost of living .
a common refrain is that wages just do n't cover the price of goods in the shops - many of which have to be imported .
so when the government announced a few years ago that it was going to join the euro from 1 january , 2008 , many people were worried .
they are a well-travelled lot here , and they knew that people in other countries had complained of price rises when the euro came .
and that played to the cypriots ' worst fears about what would happen on their island .
several opinion polls in early to mid-2007 showed most cypriots feared price rises .
so the government knew it would have to do a very good job of persuading people that the euro would not be responsible for higher costs .
it needed to learn from the mistakes made in other euro-adopting countries .
all inclusive the government realised one way it could do this would be to hammer home into its citizens ' heads the exact conversion rate from the euro to the cypriot pound .
that way , after 1 january people would know if they were being duped into paying more .
the changes will impact both big and small companies and traders hence the action plans .
for the last six months , every retail outlet has had to display prices in both euros and cypriot pounds .
at even the simplest market stall and kebab shop , the card or label will have two figures on it .
most shops have also had to display a poster on the wall , showing a whole long list of conversion values between the two currencies .
more recently , major public buildings in the capital nicosia were then draped with huge tarpaulins showing pictures of the new coins and notes .
in october , the government announced it was going to employ 100 inspectors to monitor the price of goods both before and after the introduction of the new currency .
the country 's consumer association did something similar - and also got retailers to sign up to a fair pricing agreement for when the euro would come in .
from mid-december , every home in the republic was posted a calculator , that automatically converts a euro price into a cyprus pound price .
shock free the government seems to have got its message across .
i took a stroll down ledra street , the main shopping thoroughfare in nicosia .
and most people i spoke to thought retailers would find it difficult now to get away with sneaking in price rises .
the new cyprus euro coin will show a 3,000 bc cruciform idol they pointed to the huge publicity surrounding the introduction of the new currency , and the bright spotlight shone on the retailers ' behaviour .
pretty much everyone , they said , now knows the conversion rate off by heart - 1.71 euros to the cyprus pound .
even the president of the cyprus ' consumer association , petros markou , says he is pretty untroubled .
" i think people have overcome their fears , " he explains .
" the economy has healthy competition now , so that monopolies and oligopolies find it hard to prevail .
" our economy follows the rules of the free market , of supply and demand .
secondly , cypriots are well-travelled .
they go to greece , and further afield , and are already familiar with using the euro .
it wo n't come as too much of a shock to them . "
that is not to say that cypriots are not worried about price rises in general .
far from it .
it is just they are linked to something different - inflation .
price moves in a pretty unfortunate piece of timing for the authorities , earlier in december they had to announce that year-on-year consumer price inflation rose to 3.5 % in november from 3 % in october .
our fellow citizens also have to exercise some self-control to keep wage demands within the realms of productivity michalis sarris , cyprus ' finance minister some individual prices have risen by far more , with healthcare costs climbing by 6.9 % , transport by 6.6 % , and hotels and restaurants by 6.1 % .
the upwards pressure on prices has meant that , at its last very meeting in december , the cypriot central bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 4.5 % .
analysts said that with the introduction of the euro it would have dearly liked to bring the borrowing costs more into line with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- rate of 4 % , but that was not possible .
cypriots are obviously keen at the moment to spend their money , and it does have some benefits .
the economy is growing almost twice as fast as the european average .
but the flip side of higher-than-ideal inflation is hurting business .
alternative efficiencies take zorbas fine foods , one of the biggest private employers on the island , that runs 50 or so shops selling anything from cakes and biscuits to ready meals .
it is expanding into wholesale too , having just won the contract to provide the local mcdonald 's with their buns and cyprus airways with bread rolls .
companies have mixed feelings about the introduction of the euro however , chief financial officer michael michael says the costs of doing business is rising very fast .
" almost all of our products are made of flour , " he explains .
" the wheat price has gone up 100 % in the last year .
so that has hit us a lot . "
at the same time he says the company is wrestling with higher energy , labour and transport costs that are squeezing margins .
" the minimum wage has risen on average 6 % to 8 % each year for the last five years , " he says .

there are dozens of ships anchored in the harbour .
nord stream , a consortium led by russia 's gazprom which is building a new controversial pipeline , has several vessels moored at the quayside .
for months , crew members have been out at sea , carrying out surveys of the seabed in order to ensure the route of the planned pipeline is safe .
it is a huge technical and logistical challenge .
the pipeline is about 1,200 kilometres -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- long and it will run from vyborg , in russia , under the baltic sea , to greifswald , in northern germany .
once construction is completed at the end of 2010 , the pipeline will supply russian natural gas to customers all over europe .
the long-term goal is to supply up to 55 billion cubic metres of gas each year .
however , there is a hefty price tag - the pipeline is expected to cost at least 5bn euros -lrb- $ 7.4bn , £ 3.7bn -rrb- , but due to delays , the cost could rise .
at the same time , there is growing opposition to the pipeline from governments and private environmental groups .
' alternative source ' there is a perception that the pipeline was a project drawn up between russia 's state energy company gazprom and germany , and other countries claim they were not consulted .
poland and the baltic states say they feel they have been bypassed , claiming they will also lose transit fees .
the new polish prime minister , donald tusk , says he will continue to push for the planned russian-german gas pipeline to pass through poland , rather than under the baltic sea .
mr tusk says a polish route would be cheaper and he wants to hammer home the need to diversify energy supplies and ensure independence from russia .
this pipeline involves huge risks .
we do not know what will happen when the seabed is disturbed juha aromaa , greenpeace many people in finland also have deep reservations about the new pipeline .
finland 's environmental agency wants the pipeline to be moved further south .
" we are generally in favour of completing the pipeline project in order to have an alternative source of supply , " says jorma korhonen , the director general of the finnish department for external relations .
" but environmental factors have to be taken into account .
we are concerned about the impact on the environment . "
environmental group greenpeace has also criticised the project .
" this pipeline involves huge risks .
we do not know what will happen when the seabed is disturbed , " says juha aromaa , a spokesman for greenpeace .
" the baltic sea is polluted and some of the poisonous substances on the seabed could re-surface .
the pipeline also passes through several places which have been designated marine conservation areas , " he adds .
' pushing boundaries ' in an effort to allay concerns , nord stream is conducting an environmental impact study using state-of-the-art technology .
" the survey operations for nord stream involve acoustic and intervention surveys including side-scans , and remotely operated vehicles , using a gradiometer , " says bob pirie , nord stream 's offshore representative for survey operations .
" we are pushing the boundaries of surveys along such a long survey corridor . "
the gulf of finland was heavily mined , and along with chemicals , were dumped in the sea during world war ii .
high-tech equipment is vital in ensuring an accurate seabed survey engineers working on the project have been combing every inch of the seabed to make sure there are no hidden dangers .
they have divided the 1,200km-long corridor into different blocks and have accumulated vast amounts of data .
all the images filmed on the seabed are stored and analysed .
so far , nord stream engineers say the majority of objects that they have found were boulders , ship-wrecks and even a few shopping trolleys and washing machines .
but did they find any mines ?
" we have found several munitions-related items , " says simon bonnell , the senior project engineer at nord stream .
" from information available in the public domain , it is clear where the mine curtains were laid and so it 's a quantifiable issue and we are identifying where the mines may be a potential risk to the pipeline .
" if we find a mine , we inform the national authority , and we would re-route the pipeline , " he explains , adding that the real challenge is the length of the pipeline , the shallow nature of the baltic sea and the irregular seabed .
group effort nord stream officials are keen to point out that the pipeline project is not just a bilateral deal between germany and russia .
nord stream is made up of gazprom , which holds a majority 51 % stake , german energy companies e.on ruhrgas and basf / wintershall , which share a 40 % stake , and dutch energy firm , gasunie , which recently acquired a 9 % stake .
" the project is very international , " says sebastian sass , a permitting manager at nord stream .
mr sass continues that it is mutually beneficial for the companies and nations involved in the pipeline project , and adds that the pipeline has been granted " priority project " status by the european union .
" the demand for natural gas in europe is increasing .
domestic resources are depleting , " he says .
taking to the sea makes a pipeline safe and cheap , nord stream says " we will now have long contracts of around 20 years .
our shareholders are committed .
the russians are dependent on exporting gas , and the eu is dependent on imports , so there is mutual dependency , " mr sass explains .
so why did nord stream decide to build an offshore pipeline ?
officials claim there are strong commercial and environmental reasons .
" if we build an overland pipeline , there are villages , forests and lakes which we have to deal with , " says mr sass .
" we can transport more gas under higher pressure with an underwater pipeline .
we do n't need midway compression , it 's cheaper and it 's safer . "
fine tuning nord stream is due to finish the fourth stage of its survey operations in january 2008 .
the consortium is planning to publish its environmental impact assessment report in spring 2008 , as required by united nations environmental legislation .
then comes the difficult task of obtaining construction permits .
it is clear that nord stream still faces an uphill battle .

the gulf of finland was heavily mined , and along with chemicals , were dumped in the sea during world war ii .
high-tech equipment is vital in ensuring an accurate seabed survey engineers working on the project have been combing every inch of the seabed to make sure there are no hidden dangers .
they have divided the 1,200km-long corridor into different blocks and have accumulated vast amounts of data .
all the images filmed on the seabed are stored and analysed .
so far , nord stream engineers say the majority of objects that they have found were boulders , ship-wrecks and even a few shopping trolleys and washing machines .
but did they find any mines ?
" we have found several munitions-related items , " says simon bonnell , the senior project engineer at nord stream .

nord stream is made up of gazprom , which holds a majority 51 % stake , german energy companies e.on ruhrgas and basf / wintershall , which share a 40 % stake , and dutch energy firm , gasunie , which recently acquired a 9 % stake .
" the project is very international , " says sebastian sass , a permitting manager at nord stream .
mr sass continues that it is mutually beneficial for the companies and nations involved in the pipeline project , and adds that the pipeline has been granted " priority project " status by the european union .
" the demand for natural gas in europe is increasing .
domestic resources are depleting , " he says .
taking to the sea makes a pipeline safe and cheap , nord stream says " we will now have long contracts of around 20 years .
our shareholders are committed .
the russians are dependent on exporting gas , and the eu is dependent on imports , so there is mutual dependency , " mr sass explains .
so why did nord stream decide to build an offshore pipeline ?
officials claim there are strong commercial and environmental reasons .
" if we build an overland pipeline , there are villages , forests and lakes which we have to deal with , " says mr sass .
" we can transport more gas under higher pressure with an underwater pipeline .
we do n't need midway compression , it 's cheaper and it 's safer . "
fine tuning nord stream is due to finish the fourth stage of its survey operations in january 2008 .
the consortium is planning to publish its environmental impact assessment report in spring 2008 , as required by united nations environmental legislation .
then comes the difficult task of obtaining construction permits .
it is clear that nord stream still faces an uphill battle .

there are dozens of ships anchored in the harbour .
nord stream , a consortium led by russia 's gazprom which is building a new controversial pipeline , has several vessels moored at the quayside .
for months , crew members have been out at sea , carrying out surveys of the seabed in order to ensure the route of the planned pipeline is safe .
it is a huge technical and logistical challenge .
the pipeline is about 1,200 kilometres -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- long and it will run from vyborg , in russia , under the baltic sea , to greifswald , in northern germany .
once construction is completed at the end of 2010 , the pipeline will supply russian natural gas to customers all over europe .
the long-term goal is to supply up to 55 billion cubic metres of gas each year .
however , there is a hefty price tag - the pipeline is expected to cost at least 5bn euros -lrb- $ 7.4bn , £ 3.7bn -rrb- , but due to delays , the cost could rise .
at the same time , there is growing opposition to the pipeline from governments and private environmental groups .
' alternative source ' there is a perception that the pipeline was a project drawn up between russia 's state energy company gazprom and germany , and other countries claim they were not consulted .
poland and the baltic states say they feel they have been bypassed , claiming they will also lose transit fees .
the new polish prime minister , donald tusk , says he will continue to push for the planned russian-german gas pipeline to pass through poland , rather than under the baltic sea .
mr tusk says a polish route would be cheaper and he wants to hammer home the need to diversify energy supplies and ensure independence from russia .
this pipeline involves huge risks .
we do not know what will happen when the seabed is disturbed juha aromaa , greenpeace many people in finland also have deep reservations about the new pipeline .
finland 's environmental agency wants the pipeline to be moved further south .
" we are generally in favour of completing the pipeline project in order to have an alternative source of supply , " says jorma korhonen , the director general of the finnish department for external relations .
" but environmental factors have to be taken into account .
we are concerned about the impact on the environment . "
environmental group greenpeace has also criticised the project .

breakthrough breast cancer found confusion about when to refer people as urgent cases rather than routine ones .
its survey of 200 gps for bbc radio 4 's today also suggested few gps initiated conversations about breast cancer or offered screening to at-risk groups .
the british medical association said unnecessarily treating cases as urgent would put hospitals under pressure .
one doctor 's reaction to the findings guidelines the survey showed that while most gps followed guidelines set out by the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- on breast cancer referrals , some were confused about when to treat them as routine or urgent .
it found 10 % of gps would refer a woman who had previously had confirmed breast cancer routinely , when nice guidelines state she should be seen urgently .
experts want gps to increase awareness of breast cancer in addition , the study said 34 % of family doctors would refer routinely a female patient aged under 30 who had reported a lump and had reasons for concern , such as a family history of the disease , when nice advises such a case should be treated as urgent .
jeremy hughes , chief executive of breakthrough breast cancer , said it was " surprising " that all gps were not sufficiently aware of the risks of breast cancer and how urgently cases should be dealt with .
" if you go to your gp and the gp says ' well there may be something of concern here -lsb- but -rsb- it may not be very important ' you do n't go away and forget about it , you go away and worry . "
gps and primary care trusts have a key role in helping women understand the benefits of breast awareness and breast screening jeremy hughes breakthrough breast cancer the department of health said : " over 99 % of patients with suspected cancer are now seen by a specialist within two weeks of being referred by their gp . "
by december 2009 , all women referred to a specialist with breast symptoms - even if cancer is not suspected - would be seen within a fortnight , a spokesman said .
the british medical association said gps were not confused about how to handle breast cancer .
" of course , it 's better to refer urgently if you suspect or even wonder if a patient has breast cancer , " said dr laurence buckman .
" but very often women with breast disease do not have cancer , and clearly not .
" they should not be lumped together with urgent cases because what will happen is if everyone is made an urgent case there will not be enough time in outpatients . "
the survey also found that most of the gps questioned were not proactively promoting breast cancer awareness and screening to their patients aged over 50 - one of the most at-risk groups .
only 16 % of family doctors said they spoke to older women about the disease and its symptoms whenever they had an appointment , while 80 % said they did so only when asked by a patient .
according to breakthrough breast cancer , although uk survival rates have improved in recent years , they are still lower than in the us and many other european countries .
the risk of death in the first six months after diagnosis remains higher in the uk than in the rest of europe .
the uk 's mortality rate from breast cancer is the fourth highest in europe .
confusion mr hughes said this showed " a real need for education about the signs and symptoms of the disease and breast screening " .
" gps and primary care trusts have a key role in helping women understand the benefits of breast awareness and breast screening , " he added .
earlier this year , the charity also found widespread confusion among women about the signs of breast cancer .
its survey of 1,190 women over 50 found a quarter wrongly thought a persistent cough was a sign of breast cancer .
some 81 % wrongly believed a mole on the breast could be a symptom , while a third incorrectly linked an extra nipple to the disease .

one doctor 's reaction to the findings guidelines the survey showed that while most gps followed guidelines set out by the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- on breast cancer referrals , some were confused about when to treat them as routine or urgent .
it found 10 % of gps would refer a woman who had previously had confirmed breast cancer routinely , when nice guidelines state she should be seen urgently .
experts want gps to increase awareness of breast cancer in addition , the study said 34 % of family doctors would refer routinely a female patient aged under 30 who had reported a lump and had reasons for concern , such as a family history of the disease , when nice advises such a case should be treated as urgent .
jeremy hughes , chief executive of breakthrough breast cancer , said it was " surprising " that all gps were not sufficiently aware of the risks of breast cancer and how urgently cases should be dealt with .
" if you go to your gp and the gp says ' well there may be something of concern here -lsb- but -rsb- it may not be very important ' you do n't go away and forget about it , you go away and worry . "
gps and primary care trusts have a key role in helping women understand the benefits of breast awareness and breast screening jeremy hughes breakthrough breast cancer the department of health said : " over 99 % of patients with suspected cancer are now seen by a specialist within two weeks of being referred by their gp . "
by december 2009 , all women referred to a specialist with breast symptoms - even if cancer is not suspected - would be seen within a fortnight , a spokesman said .
the british medical association said gps were not confused about how to handle breast cancer .
" of course , it 's better to refer urgently if you suspect or even wonder if a patient has breast cancer , " said dr laurence buckman .
" but very often women with breast disease do not have cancer , and clearly not .
" they should not be lumped together with urgent cases because what will happen is if everyone is made an urgent case there will not be enough time in outpatients . "
the survey also found that most of the gps questioned were not proactively promoting breast cancer awareness and screening to their patients aged over 50 - one of the most at-risk groups .
only 16 % of family doctors said they spoke to older women about the disease and its symptoms whenever they had an appointment , while 80 % said they did so only when asked by a patient .
according to breakthrough breast cancer , although uk survival rates have improved in recent years , they are still lower than in the us and many other european countries .
the risk of death in the first six months after diagnosis remains higher in the uk than in the rest of europe .
the uk 's mortality rate from breast cancer is the fourth highest in europe .
confusion mr hughes said this showed " a real need for education about the signs and symptoms of the disease and breast screening " .
" gps and primary care trusts have a key role in helping women understand the benefits of breast awareness and breast screening , " he added .
earlier this year , the charity also found widespread confusion among women about the signs of breast cancer .
its survey of 1,190 women over 50 found a quarter wrongly thought a persistent cough was a sign of breast cancer .
some 81 % wrongly believed a mole on the breast could be a symptom , while a third incorrectly linked an extra nipple to the disease .
