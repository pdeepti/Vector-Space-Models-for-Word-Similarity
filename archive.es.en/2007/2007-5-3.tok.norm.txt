program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.05.2007 opinion : dialogue is always progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as an attempt to institutionalize dialogue between the muslim community and the german government , the islam conference has a long way to go .
but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .
but the way this minority is treated is a test of how open-minded and tolerant germany is - and how capable it is of respecting other religions .
in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- discord reigns ahead of german-muslim talks expectations will be low on wednesday when german officials and leading muslims meet for the second bi-annual conference on islam .
rows over who is qualified to speak for germany 's muslims have soured the atmosphere .

this was the question taken up in berlin at a conference that brought together prominent muslims and politicians from the united kingdom and germany .

a boys-only school , the ministry said , would infringe on that right . but that the parents ' initiative which applied to open the school does not feel that way . " it makes educational sense to school boys and girls separately , " retaliated christoph rüssel , one of those behind the application .
he also maintains the ministry decision is untenable . " the constitution guarantees parents the right to choose alternative schooling for their children , " he insisted .
legal experts have agreed , on the grounds that laws on gender equality in education do not apply to private schooling . sinister cult ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph rüssel in front of what would have been the school premises meanwhile , rüssel downplayed the opus dei connection , saying the school would have kept to brandenburg 's standard curriculum . " opus dei would have provided spiritual direction , " he said .
" it would have supplied a priest , who would have held regular mass and given classes on religion .
but these classes would have reflected the archbishopric 's syllabus . " often described as the most controversial force in the catholic church , the organization has 85,000 members worldwide , and 600 in germany . opus dei - which in latin means " work of god " - was founded by roman catholic priest josemaria escriva in 1928 in madrid . the movement flourished during the years of franco 's rule , spreading first throughout spain and expanding internationally after 1945 . many of the concerns about the organization 's credibility focus on these years , with critics asserting that escriva and the organization supported the governments of franco and augusto pinochet . escriva allegedly also expressed sympathy for adolf hitler .
even today , opus dei priests have reportedly been known to doubt the extent of the holocaust . communist throwback wieland niekirsch of the christian democrats has dismissed the decision to turn down the application as a throwback to the communist era . " clearly , one can have private and even critical objections to a catholic high school backed by members of opus dei , " he said .

while debt relief goals set at gleneagles have largely been met , most g8 countries are well behind on the aid targets , the bishops said .
they called on the g8 countries attending a summit in the northern germany town of heiligendamm on june 6-8 to commit to reaching the target of 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015 , one of the targets set by the un 's millennium development goals .

" we want to make political leaders realize that there has been a globalization of economic growth and therefore that there needs to be a globalization of charity and responsibility , " said laurent monsengwo , the archbishop of kisangani , one of the dioceses in the democratic republic of congo seeking aid .
" we see wealth and material fortune at the same time as abject poverty , " the german bishops said in a joint statement .

success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.05.2007 opinion : dialogue is always progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as an attempt to institutionalize dialogue between the muslim community and the german government , the islam conference has a long way to go .
but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .
but the way this minority is treated is a test of how open-minded and tolerant germany is - and how capable it is of respecting other religions .
in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- discord reigns ahead of german-muslim talks expectations will be low on wednesday when german officials and leading muslims meet for the second bi-annual conference on islam .
rows over who is qualified to speak for germany 's muslims have soured the atmosphere .
-lrb- 30.04.2007 -rrb- berlin meeting brings muslims and lawmakers to one table how well are muslims integrated into european societies ?
this was the question taken up in berlin at a conference that brought together prominent muslims and politicians from the united kingdom and germany .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview .

she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .

sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .

she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.05.2007 opinion : dialogue is always progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as an attempt to institutionalize dialogue between the muslim community and the german government , the islam conference has a long way to go .
but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .
but the way this minority is treated is a test of how open-minded and tolerant germany is - and how capable it is of respecting other religions .
in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- discord reigns ahead of german-muslim talks expectations will be low on wednesday when german officials and leading muslims meet for the second bi-annual conference on islam .
rows over who is qualified to speak for germany 's muslims have soured the atmosphere .
-lrb- 30.04.2007 -rrb- berlin meeting brings muslims and lawmakers to one table how well are muslims integrated into european societies ?
this was the question taken up in berlin at a conference that brought together prominent muslims and politicians from the united kingdom and germany .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.05.2007 opinion : dialogue is always progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as an attempt to institutionalize dialogue between the muslim community and the german government , the islam conference has a long way to go .
but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .
but the way this minority is treated is a test of how open-minded and tolerant germany is - and how capable it is of respecting other religions .
in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- discord reigns ahead of german-muslim talks expectations will be low on wednesday when german officials and leading muslims meet for the second bi-annual conference on islam .

thanking him for the " long years of cooperation between our two countries , " merkel said 74-year-old chirac " had constantly been aware that franco-german cooperation always needed dynamism . "
chirac , she recalled , had been the first foreign head of state to give a speech to the unified german parliament in the restored reichstag building in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and merkel have had a good relationship " long live the friendship between germany and france , " the chancellor said .
chirac , making his 32nd visit to germany in 12 years as president , said : " it is both very important and symbolic that my last official visit should be to germany . "
eu " motor " germany and france are often called the " motor " of the european union and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign ports of call for either the center-right nicolas sarkozy or the socialist candidate segolene royal following the second round of the french presidential election on sunday .
merkel will want to hear the views of the new president on how france , whose voters rejected the draft eu constitution in a 2005 referendum , proposes to break the impasse .
chirac said france and germany must take the lead in europe on issues such as the constitution and the pressing issue of climate change .
" we must do all of that together or it will not be done well , " he said .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of june .
chirac leaves the elysee palace on may 16 , making way for le nouveau président or la nouvelle présidente .

but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .
but the way this minority is treated is a test of how open-minded and tolerant germany is - and how capable it is of respecting other religions .
in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .

success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .

while debt relief goals set at gleneagles have largely been met , most g8 countries are well behind on the aid targets , the bishops said .
they called on the g8 countries attending a summit in the northern germany town of heiligendamm on june 6-8 to commit to reaching the target of 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015 , one of the targets set by the un 's millennium development goals .

" we want to make political leaders realize that there has been a globalization of economic growth and therefore that there needs to be a globalization of charity and responsibility , " said laurent monsengwo , the archbishop of kisangani , one of the dioceses in the democratic republic of congo seeking aid .
" we see wealth and material fortune at the same time as abject poverty , " the german bishops said in a joint statement .
" while the number of millionaires and billionaires is growing fast in some parts of the world , the numbers of the extreme poor remain stubbornly high . " pop icon geldof makes own plea adding to the chorus of voices making appeals to g8 leaders to live up to their aid commitments was irish musician bob geldof , who will be attending the g8 summit .
" if anything works , then it 's development aid , " said the 55-year-old rocker , speaking at an intellectual live 8 conference in berlin on wednesday .

geldof is also demanding that germany , whose economy is currently improving , take the lead in making good the eu pledge to commit 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid .
" there 's no lack of money , there 's a lack of thought , " said the singer , who launched the famed live aid concerts in the 80s .
merkel has promised that aid to africa and other developing nations will be one of the major themes of the g8 summit , which will also be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a g8 summit in berlin , with fresher faces a g8 summit of sorts has just wrapped up in berlin , though delegates here had fewer wrinkles than those heading to the heiligendamm summit in early june .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .
far-right candidate jean-marie le pen received 10.4 percent .
on tuesday le pen urged his 3.8 million voters not to vote for sarkozy or royal .

while debt relief goals set at gleneagles have largely been met , most g8 countries are well behind on the aid targets , the bishops said .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .
far-right candidate jean-marie le pen received 10.4 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 03.05.2007 europe 's nationalists watch scottish elections with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a recent drop in support , scottish independence is still a hot election issue scotland 's elections are being watched by secessionist groups around europe hoping to get a glimpse of their own autonomous futures .
success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .

earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .
far-right candidate jean-marie le pen received 10.4 percent .

two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .

the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "

a boys-only school , the ministry said , would infringe on that right . but that the parents ' initiative which applied to open the school does not feel that way . " it makes educational sense to school boys and girls separately , " retaliated christoph rüssel , one of those behind the application .
he also maintains the ministry decision is untenable . " the constitution guarantees parents the right to choose alternative schooling for their children , " he insisted .
legal experts have agreed , on the grounds that laws on gender equality in education do not apply to private schooling . sinister cult ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph rüssel in front of what would have been the school premises meanwhile , rüssel downplayed the opus dei connection , saying the school would have kept to brandenburg 's standard curriculum . " opus dei would have provided spiritual direction , " he said .
" it would have supplied a priest , who would have held regular mass and given classes on religion .
but these classes would have reflected the archbishopric 's syllabus . " often described as the most controversial force in the catholic church , the organization has 85,000 members worldwide , and 600 in germany . opus dei - which in latin means " work of god " - was founded by roman catholic priest josemaria escriva in 1928 in madrid . the movement flourished during the years of franco 's rule , spreading first throughout spain and expanding internationally after 1945 . many of the concerns about the organization 's credibility focus on these years , with critics asserting that escriva and the organization supported the governments of franco and augusto pinochet . escriva allegedly also expressed sympathy for adolf hitler .
even today , opus dei priests have reportedly been known to doubt the extent of the holocaust . communist throwback wieland niekirsch of the christian democrats has dismissed the decision to turn down the application as a throwback to the communist era . " clearly , one can have private and even critical objections to a catholic high school backed by members of opus dei , " he said .
" but to turn this into a guideline for government decisions is reminiscent of the negative aspects of the former east germany 's educational policies .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .

that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

while debt relief goals set at gleneagles have largely been met , most g8 countries are well behind on the aid targets , the bishops said .
they called on the g8 countries attending a summit in the northern germany town of heiligendamm on june 6-8 to commit to reaching the target of 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015 , one of the targets set by the un 's millennium development goals .

" pop icon geldof makes own plea adding to the chorus of voices making appeals to g8 leaders to live up to their aid commitments was irish musician bob geldof , who will be attending the g8 summit .

" there 's no lack of money , there 's a lack of thought , " said the singer , who launched the famed live aid concerts in the 80s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.05.2007 opinion : dialogue is always progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as an attempt to institutionalize dialogue between the muslim community and the german government , the islam conference has a long way to go .
but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .
but the way this minority is treated is a test of how open-minded and tolerant germany is - and how capable it is of respecting other religions .
in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- discord reigns ahead of german-muslim talks expectations will be low on wednesday when german officials and leading muslims meet for the second bi-annual conference on islam .
rows over who is qualified to speak for germany 's muslims have soured the atmosphere .
-lrb- 30.04.2007 -rrb- berlin meeting brings muslims and lawmakers to one table how well are muslims integrated into european societies ?
this was the question taken up in berlin at a conference that brought together prominent muslims and politicians from the united kingdom and germany .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .
far-right candidate jean-marie le pen received 10.4 percent .

earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .

in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 03.05.2007 europe 's nationalists watch scottish elections with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a recent drop in support , scottish independence is still a hot election issue scotland 's elections are being watched by secessionist groups around europe hoping to get a glimpse of their own autonomous futures .
success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president french far-right leader tells supporters to stay home elections -pipe- 03.05.2007 as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither candidate was able to claim a clear victory after the debate a crucial french presidential debate between frequently bad-tempered candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal failed to give either candidate a significant boost in the polls . tempers ran high as right-winger sarkozy and his socialist rival royal faced off across a white table in wednesday 's hour televised debate , which was watched by an estimated 20 million viewers and ran over two hours .
with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .

in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .

with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .

that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .

moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .

" there 's no lack of money , there 's a lack of thought , " said the singer , who launched the famed live aid concerts in the 80s .

some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .

he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "

a boys-only school , the ministry said , would infringe on that right . but that the parents ' initiative which applied to open the school does not feel that way . " it makes educational sense to school boys and girls separately , " retaliated christoph rüssel , one of those behind the application .
he also maintains the ministry decision is untenable . " the constitution guarantees parents the right to choose alternative schooling for their children , " he insisted .
legal experts have agreed , on the grounds that laws on gender equality in education do not apply to private schooling . sinister cult ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph rüssel in front of what would have been the school premises meanwhile , rüssel downplayed the opus dei connection , saying the school would have kept to brandenburg 's standard curriculum . " opus dei would have provided spiritual direction , " he said .
" it would have supplied a priest , who would have held regular mass and given classes on religion .
but these classes would have reflected the archbishopric 's syllabus . " often described as the most controversial force in the catholic church , the organization has 85,000 members worldwide , and 600 in germany . opus dei - which in latin means " work of god " - was founded by roman catholic priest josemaria escriva in 1928 in madrid . the movement flourished during the years of franco 's rule , spreading first throughout spain and expanding internationally after 1945 . many of the concerns about the organization 's credibility focus on these years , with critics asserting that escriva and the organization supported the governments of franco and augusto pinochet . escriva allegedly also expressed sympathy for adolf hitler .
even today , opus dei priests have reportedly been known to doubt the extent of the holocaust . communist throwback wieland niekirsch of the christian democrats has dismissed the decision to turn down the application as a throwback to the communist era . " clearly , one can have private and even critical objections to a catholic high school backed by members of opus dei , " he said .
" but to turn this into a guideline for government decisions is reminiscent of the negative aspects of the former east germany 's educational policies .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .

a boys-only school , the ministry said , would infringe on that right . but that the parents ' initiative which applied to open the school does not feel that way . " it makes educational sense to school boys and girls separately , " retaliated christoph rüssel , one of those behind the application .
he also maintains the ministry decision is untenable . " the constitution guarantees parents the right to choose alternative schooling for their children , " he insisted .
legal experts have agreed , on the grounds that laws on gender equality in education do not apply to private schooling . sinister cult ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph rüssel in front of what would have been the school premises meanwhile , rüssel downplayed the opus dei connection , saying the school would have kept to brandenburg 's standard curriculum . " opus dei would have provided spiritual direction , " he said .
" it would have supplied a priest , who would have held regular mass and given classes on religion .
but these classes would have reflected the archbishopric 's syllabus . " often described as the most controversial force in the catholic church , the organization has 85,000 members worldwide , and 600 in germany . opus dei - which in latin means " work of god " - was founded by roman catholic priest josemaria escriva in 1928 in madrid . the movement flourished during the years of franco 's rule , spreading first throughout spain and expanding internationally after 1945 . many of the concerns about the organization 's credibility focus on these years , with critics asserting that escriva and the organization supported the governments of franco and augusto pinochet . escriva allegedly also expressed sympathy for adolf hitler .
even today , opus dei priests have reportedly been known to doubt the extent of the holocaust . communist throwback wieland niekirsch of the christian democrats has dismissed the decision to turn down the application as a throwback to the communist era . " clearly , one can have private and even critical objections to a catholic high school backed by members of opus dei , " he said .
" but to turn this into a guideline for government decisions is reminiscent of the negative aspects of the former east germany 's educational policies .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 03.05.2007 europe 's nationalists watch scottish elections with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a recent drop in support , scottish independence is still a hot election issue scotland 's elections are being watched by secessionist groups around europe hoping to get a glimpse of their own autonomous futures .
success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .
river-type glaciers in the alps such as the pasterze have all but disappeared , while ice sheets high on the mountains , often used for skiing during the summer months , are shrinking . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to become world 's most energy-efficient country the german environment ministry this week unveiled a set of highly ambitious proposals that would lead germany to become the world 's most energy-efficient country in the coming years .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .

he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

thanking him for the " long years of cooperation between our two countries , " merkel said 74-year-old chirac " had constantly been aware that franco-german cooperation always needed dynamism . "
chirac , she recalled , had been the first foreign head of state to give a speech to the unified german parliament in the restored reichstag building in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and merkel have had a good relationship " long live the friendship between germany and france , " the chancellor said .
chirac , making his 32nd visit to germany in 12 years as president , said : " it is both very important and symbolic that my last official visit should be to germany . "
eu " motor " germany and france are often called the " motor " of the european union and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign ports of call for either the center-right nicolas sarkozy or the socialist candidate segolene royal following the second round of the french presidential election on sunday .
merkel will want to hear the views of the new president on how france , whose voters rejected the draft eu constitution in a 2005 referendum , proposes to break the impasse .
chirac said france and germany must take the lead in europe on issues such as the constitution and the pressing issue of climate change .
" we must do all of that together or it will not be done well , " he said .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of june .
chirac leaves the elysee palace on may 16 , making way for le nouveau président or la nouvelle présidente .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 03.05.2007 europe 's nationalists watch scottish elections with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a recent drop in support , scottish independence is still a hot election issue scotland 's elections are being watched by secessionist groups around europe hoping to get a glimpse of their own autonomous futures .
success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .

but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .

but that dialogue is even possible now is progress , argues dw 's baha güngor . launched last year by interior minister wolfgang schäuble , this was the second islam conference -lrb- dik -rrb- to take place in berlin . the participants were ready and willing to keep the debate open , however heated , and reach consensus .
that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .
the catholic church , after all , represents a considerably larger number - a handful of fringe groups aside - whereas the muslim council 's members number 350,000 of over 3,5 million muslims in germany .
moreover , some 500,000 alevites and 200,000 shiites can not be ignored even when the majority of muslims here are sunni . many new developments , however , should be welcomed .
germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .
but the way this minority is treated is a test of how open-minded and tolerant germany is - and how capable it is of respecting other religions .
in this respect , the islam conference is an important step in the right direction . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- discord reigns ahead of german-muslim talks expectations will be low on wednesday when german officials and leading muslims meet for the second bi-annual conference on islam .
rows over who is qualified to speak for germany 's muslims have soured the atmosphere .

while debt relief goals set at gleneagles have largely been met , most g8 countries are well behind on the aid targets , the bishops said .
they called on the g8 countries attending a summit in the northern germany town of heiligendamm on june 6-8 to commit to reaching the target of 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015 , one of the targets set by the un 's millennium development goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 03.05.2007 europe 's nationalists watch scottish elections with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a recent drop in support , scottish independence is still a hot election issue scotland 's elections are being watched by secessionist groups around europe hoping to get a glimpse of their own autonomous futures .
success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

" it would have supplied a priest , who would have held regular mass and given classes on religion .
but these classes would have reflected the archbishopric 's syllabus .

even today , opus dei priests have reportedly been known to doubt the extent of the holocaust . communist throwback wieland niekirsch of the christian democrats has dismissed the decision to turn down the application as a throwback to the communist era . " clearly , one can have private and even critical objections to a catholic high school backed by members of opus dei , " he said .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

thanking him for the " long years of cooperation between our two countries , " merkel said 74-year-old chirac " had constantly been aware that franco-german cooperation always needed dynamism . "
chirac , she recalled , had been the first foreign head of state to give a speech to the unified german parliament in the restored reichstag building in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and merkel have had a good relationship " long live the friendship between germany and france , " the chancellor said .
chirac , making his 32nd visit to germany in 12 years as president , said : " it is both very important and symbolic that my last official visit should be to germany . "
eu " motor " germany and france are often called the " motor " of the european union and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign ports of call for either the center-right nicolas sarkozy or the socialist candidate segolene royal following the second round of the french presidential election on sunday .
merkel will want to hear the views of the new president on how france , whose voters rejected the draft eu constitution in a 2005 referendum , proposes to break the impasse .
chirac said france and germany must take the lead in europe on issues such as the constitution and the pressing issue of climate change .
" we must do all of that together or it will not be done well , " he said .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of june .
chirac leaves the elysee palace on may 16 , making way for le nouveau président or la nouvelle présidente .

thanking him for the " long years of cooperation between our two countries , " merkel said 74-year-old chirac " had constantly been aware that franco-german cooperation always needed dynamism . "
chirac , she recalled , had been the first foreign head of state to give a speech to the unified german parliament in the restored reichstag building in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and merkel have had a good relationship " long live the friendship between germany and france , " the chancellor said .
chirac , making his 32nd visit to germany in 12 years as president , said : " it is both very important and symbolic that my last official visit should be to germany . "
eu " motor " germany and france are often called the " motor " of the european union and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign ports of call for either the center-right nicolas sarkozy or the socialist candidate segolene royal following the second round of the french presidential election on sunday .
merkel will want to hear the views of the new president on how france , whose voters rejected the draft eu constitution in a 2005 referendum , proposes to break the impasse .
chirac said france and germany must take the lead in europe on issues such as the constitution and the pressing issue of climate change .
" we must do all of that together or it will not be done well , " he said .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of june .
chirac leaves the elysee palace on may 16 , making way for le nouveau président or la nouvelle présidente .

that is already one positive result . clearly , the problems , obstacles and prejudices that have amassed over the decades will never be resolved overnight , and the participants were clever enough to make no promises - and to keep their expectations deliberately low , setting a timeframe of two to three years to realize their goals . the committee - made up of muslims living in germany as well as german politicians - also agreed that germany 's separation of church and state as well as the freedom of religion enshrined in the constitution were principles beyond debate . the tasks of the various subcommittees , therefore , were to address primarily the need to promote improved understanding and an unconditional recognition of german social structures and values .
another priority was to reconcile religious faith with the german constitution .
the role the economy and the media should play in tackling prejudice as well as the thorny issues of security and fundamentalism were also up for discussion . but disputes about the status of the muslim coordination council made of four leading muslim associations show what a long and winding road lies ahead .
this council is keen to be recognized as the muslim 's community 's definitive representative , but the call has been rejected by interior minister wolfgang schäuble on the grounds that an organization that counts as its members just ten percent of muslims living in germany should not be in a position to speak for an entire community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the council 's argument that the catholic church represents all catholics , including those who do not belong to the church , is a weak one .

germany 's individual states are increasingly eager to include immigrant experts in their decision-making processes .
the reluctance of various immigrant groups to integrate is finally being constructively addressed , which shows that germany is willing to listen to minorities with and without german citizenship - and thereby widen the scope for cultural diversity in germany . germany 's 3.5 million muslims make up just four percent of its population .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .
far-right candidate jean-marie le pen received 10.4 percent .

in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .
far-right candidate jean-marie le pen received 10.4 percent .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "
orhan pamuk ’ s " istanbul : memories and the city " is also available in english .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 03.05.2007 europe 's nationalists watch scottish elections with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a recent drop in support , scottish independence is still a hot election issue scotland 's elections are being watched by secessionist groups around europe hoping to get a glimpse of their own autonomous futures .
success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .
it could also anger countries like spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway scotland would set , such as the catalans and basques in spain , the flemish in belgium and the people of northern cyprus .
" they would welcome the scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same . also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post-national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across europe and beyond , " ichijo said .
in addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a scottish succession could also provide a headache for the european union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" it would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the eu , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the european council and european parliament , " said ichijo .
" at a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the eu .

success for the scottish nationalist party could be a real step towards independence . may 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " super thursday " in the united kingdom as voters in england , scotland and wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
while it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in england will be used to give outgoing prime minister tony blair and his labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on scotland .
outside of scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the scottish parliament could reverberate around europe .
the manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic scottish issues but the biggest topic - that of scottish independence - has wider implications for the united kingdom and beyond .
out of the eight contesting parties , only the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- , the scottish socialist party -lrb- ssp -rrb- and the solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on scottish independence should they get elected to the holyrood parliament .
according to recent polls , scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
the most telling survey results point to an end to the labour party ’ s 50-year dominance of scottish politics with forecasts showing the snp set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than labour , as dissatisfied labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
end of 300-year marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the union be cast asunder by scottish nationalists ?
however , while an snp success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between england and scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent scotland .
proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the scottish parliament .
so even if the snp emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
the three mainstream parties - labour , the conservative party and the liberal democrats - have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
in addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
a survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
now , only about 27 percent of scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
the snp promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in thursday ’ s parliamentary elections , the snp would put the question to the country in 2010 .
an expanded eu role for scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snp leader alex salmond has a european vision ahead of such a referendum , the snp would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
it is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from england with a vision of an expanded role - and increased prosperity - within the european union .
scotland , as a part of the united kingdom , is already a member of the european union and the snp believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the uk was achieved .
however , atsuko ichijo , an expert on scottish nationalism at kingston university , london , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" the snp 's position is that , because scotland is part of the eu already as a constituent part of the uk , when scotland becomes independent both scotland and the rest of the uk will inherit the uk membership and ' share ' it between them , " ichijo told dw-world.de. however , she added , the european commission has raised questions about this assumption .
there are a number of constitutional difficulties the eu would face if it allowed scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under uk membership .
" the fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue eu membership , " she said .
" i do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent scottish membership of the eu would take . "
eu states concerned over scottish plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basques would welcome scottish independence should scotland become independent and join the eu as a separate state from the rest of the uk , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within europe .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview .

she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "

two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .

in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "

while debt relief goals set at gleneagles have largely been met , most g8 countries are well behind on the aid targets , the bishops said .
they called on the g8 countries attending a summit in the northern germany town of heiligendamm on june 6-8 to commit to reaching the target of 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015 , one of the targets set by the un 's millennium development goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles , the site of disputed accords the debts of the world 's poorest countries should be cancelled without conditions , they said , echoing a recent call from pope benedict xvi . call to ' globalize charity ' the bishops urged g8 nations to promote good governance in developing countries by systematically involving them in discussions on policy and loans .
" we want to make political leaders realize that there has been a globalization of economic growth and therefore that there needs to be a globalization of charity and responsibility , " said laurent monsengwo , the archbishop of kisangani , one of the dioceses in the democratic republic of congo seeking aid .
" we see wealth and material fortune at the same time as abject poverty , " the german bishops said in a joint statement .
" while the number of millionaires and billionaires is growing fast in some parts of the world , the numbers of the extreme poor remain stubbornly high . " pop icon geldof makes own plea adding to the chorus of voices making appeals to g8 leaders to live up to their aid commitments was irish musician bob geldof , who will be attending the g8 summit .
" if anything works , then it 's development aid , " said the 55-year-old rocker , speaking at an intellectual live 8 conference in berlin on wednesday .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .

in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "

though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

with the outcome of sunday 's runoff vote in play , most commentators called the debate a draw .
royal trailed by a slight margin going into the debate , and the numbers remained nearly unchanged thursday morning , with sarkozy holding a lead of 53.5 percent to royal 's 46.5 percent of the voters polled by ipsos sa / dell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french media is consumed with a final campaign push on thursday , in the aftermath of the face-off , the rivals continued to trade barbs .
sarkozy repeated that he was " surprised by the degree of aggressiveness " shown by royal during the debate , and accused her of being " intolerant . " " it is revealing of the reactions that can come from some quarters of the left who consider anyone who does not share their ideas as illegitimate , " sarkozy said in a french radio interview . ' sarkozy is like a screaming child ' for her part , royal told french radio that sarkozy " did not dare " repeat during the debate some of the accusations he has directed at her during the campaign .
she said he reminded her " of those children who kick and then cry out first to make believe that it was their playmate who hit first . "
during the debate , long-held disagreements between the candidates repeatedly flared into ill-restrained hostility , with royal launching a volley of attacks on sarkozy 's record in government , and sarkozy trying - at times successfully - to bait royal into losing her cool .
in the most fiery outburst , royal charged sarkozy with " political immorality " after he said that handicapped children should be guaranteed a place in ordinary schools . bildunterschrift : ' you lose your temper easily , madame ' " i am scandalized by what i have just heard , " royal said , accusing sarkozy 's government of dismantling socialist party education measures for the handicapped .
" this is the height of political immorality . "
sarkozy , who remained calm during the attack , retorted : " i do n't question your sincerity , do n't question my morality ...
you lose your temper very easily , madame . "
earlier , sarkozy repeated a pledge to cut the number of state workers - prompting accusations from royal that he would endanger public health and education services . debating employment strategies sarkozy said he would ensure full employment in france in five years by " freeing the forces of labor , " and said the 35-hour working week - introduced by the last socialist government - was killing employment .
" she -lrb- royal -rrb- still thinks that you have to share out the work like pieces of a cake , " sarkozy said .
" not a single country in the world accepts this logic , which is a monumental mistake . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a slight lead in the polls royal countered with a promise to create 500,000 jobs for younger people , funded from existing training and unemployment budgets .
she questioned sarkozy 's citation of an economic think-tank that said his program would benefit the economy more than royal 's .
this prompted sarkozy to ask : " why do you treat anyone who is not of your opinion with irony , even with contempt ? " tight race ; no clear winner on several occasions , royal responded to sarkozy 's proposals by saying : " what a pity you did n't do that during your five years in government . "
the encounter was expected to be decisive in determining the choice of millions of uncommitted voters on sunday .
nearly 7 million people chose defeated centrist francois bayrou in the first round on april 22 , and the second-round campaign has focused on capturing his electorate . analysts said neither candidate had scored a decisive victory .
" there were two winners - with perhaps a slight advantage to sarkozy .
neither fell into the trap prepared by the other .
sarkozy did not lose his temper and royal did not come across as light-weight or incompetent , " said christophe barbier , editor of l 'express magazine .
' breathtaking ' or ' aggressive ' ? former socialist minister jack lang said , " segolene royal was breathtaking from start to finish .
with real panache , she constantly set the agenda .
she obviously appeared as the president of france . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal lost her cool , briefly but jacques myard , a deputy from sarkozy 's ruling ump party , said royal " was in a state of near-permanent aggressiveness .
opposite her , nicolas sarkozy was convincing , able to calmly spell out his arguments without sounding like he was reading from a book . "
campaigning for the second round ends on friday at midnight .
on thursday the two candidates hold their last rallies , royal in the northern city of lille and sarkozy in montpellier in the south .
in the first round of voting , sarkozy got 31.2 percent of the vote and royal 25.9 percent .
far-right candidate jean-marie le pen received 10.4 percent .
on tuesday le pen urged his 3.8 million voters not to vote for sarkozy or royal .

this year , the zugspitzbahn company , which finances the cover-up from revenues from its ski-lift , gondola-lifts and restaurant , ordered 50 percent more tarpaulin than last year .
the tarps were unpacked one week earlier than usual following a particularly mild winter and the hottest april in recent history .
" the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater , " said manfred haas , who manages a team that grooms the ski area with bulldozers and graders .
" every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring . "
postponing the inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the ski area on the mountain is covered with tarps the process , which only protects part of the mountain , was begun 16 years ago .
though the sun-screen tarps are aimed at curbing the effects of climate change , environmentalists have assailed the annual cover-up as folly .
hubert weiger , bavarian chairman of the german nature protection federation , called the tarpaulin a " fig-leaf . "
" it will never save the glacier , " he said .
according to frank huber from the zugspitzbahn company , he and his colleagues have no illusions that they will be able to preserve the glacier entirely . " with the tarps and all the other things we do , we ’ ll only be able to prolong the process , " he told the reuters news agency .
" the zugspitze lives from tourism and it ’ s our goal to keep the ski industry running . " all glaciers in danger the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , set up by the united nations , predicts that many of the world 's temperate-zone glaciers will shrink drastically or vanish completely as temperatures rise .
larger glaciers will have lost between 30 and 70 percent of their volume by the year 2050 , reported ipcc .

thanking him for the " long years of cooperation between our two countries , " merkel said 74-year-old chirac " had constantly been aware that franco-german cooperation always needed dynamism . "

" the nobel prize winner began his book tour wednesday evening in hamburg .
two and a half months earlier , orhan pamuk had called off his appearance there after receiving public death threats from turkish ultra-nationalists .
hamburg 's deutsches schauspielhaus was bursting at the seams and extra chairs had to be pulled in .
some were curious to learn more about the cancellation of the february book tour , while others came to hear the 55-year-old author 's opinion on the current political turmoil in his home country .
yet the evening turned out completely differently than expected .
no mention of death threats pamuk didn ’ t say a word about february ’ s cancellation , which happened after his friend , armenian journalist hrant dink , was shot and killed on an istanbul street on january 19 .
the perpetrators then warned pamuk , in front of rolling cameras , to be cautious .
their warning referred to an interview the author had given in which he ’ d said : " 30,000 kurds and one million armenians were murdered in turkey and not a single person talks about it .
so i have to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has been vocal about the armenian genocide in turkey following world war one since then , pamuk has feared for his life .
he devoted wednesday evening to his new book " istanbul . "
in the autobiographical narrative , pamuk weaves together the story of the city with that of his family .
since both are marked by disintegration , hüzün - the turkish word for collective melancholy - plays an important role in the book .
" this collective feeling of hüzün has to do with loss , the loss of the former kingdom , " said pamuk through an interpreter wednesday in hamburg .
" it ’ s also about the feeling of living on the border to the west .
on the other side of the border there are wealthy countries and on this side we ’ re so poor . "
the bridge builder pamuk has been called a " bridge builder between the orient and the occident . " " even though it ’ s not my job , i do it anyway because i don ’ t want the east and the west , islam and europe to be in conflict , " he said .
" i don ’ t want that , because i belong to both . "
although pamuk didn ’ t mention the recent death threats , in the end he didn ’ t need to .
the half-dozen well-built men standing silently behind the author while he autographed books spoke volumes for his experiences over the past few months .
in what might be called prescience , in his nobel prize speech in 2006 , pamuk said : " it ’ s a known harbinger of dark and foolish times in a country when books are burned and writers are humiliated . "

centrist leader francois bayrou may have failed in his bid to make the left-right divide obsolete by reaching the run-off - but he has succeeded in hogging the limelight .
he is being courted by both socialist segolene royal and her conservative rival nicolas sarkozy .
mr bayrou has endorsed neither , leaving his 6.8m voters to make their own decision in sunday 's poll .
vote who do you think won the debate ?
segolene royal nicolas sarkozy neither results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion the question on every french mind is - which way will his crucial constituency turn ?
a good place to find out is pau , mr bayrou 's south-western stronghold .
as two dozen local activists from mr bayrou 's udf party gathered at his headquarters in the city to watch wednesday 's debate between mr sarkozy and ms royal , the atmosphere was downcast but intense .
all were still struggling to accept their hero 's defeat and the end of the dream of a sea-change in french politics .
" i do n't want a centre-right and i do n't want a centre-left , i want a unifying figure who can draw from both , " said florent sere , a party activist who had come from bayonne 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- away .
watching the defectives the activists found little to choose between two candidates on offer as they watched the debate .
" i 'm torn , i really am , " julien pardon , a 30-year-old salesman from pau , said .
tv debate : excerpts rivals ' policies examined ghettos mobilise for vote like almost every person in the room , he is repelled by what he regards as mr sarkozy 's authoritarianism and fishing for far-right votes .
" his dalliance with the national front does not suit me at all , " mr pardon said , to general applause .
but he and many others are also dismayed by ms royal 's old-left rhetoric , as well as her perceived amateurism and the vagueness of her programme .
after the debate a young woman summed up the general feeling by joking : " did you prefer patrick poivre d 'arvor or arlette chabot ? " - referring to the two journalists who had moderated the encounter .
in the end , however , many - perhaps as much as a third - of the activists said ms royal was the lesser of two evils .
" we must oppose repression , " said vincent bayou , 24 - meaning mr sarkozy .
" i will vote for segolene , holding my nose . "
several agreed glumly that at least she was a tolerant figure and expressed the hope that if elected , her advisers would stop her from wrecking the economy .
' harmful ' a minority held out no such hope , and were prepared to put their deep distrust of mr sarkozy aside . "
we must have as many blank votes as possible " florent sere francois bayou supporter " if segolene is elected it will be a catastrophe , " frederic jourda , 40 , said after listening to both sides .
" she can do much more harm to this country that him . "
sandrine bernardin , 29 , agreed : " the president is in charge of foreign affairs .
i do n't want to be represented by segolene royal at the g8 . "
but by far the biggest single bloc in the audience was made up of those - about half of the total - who said they would cast a blank vote on sunday .
" before the debate i was ready to vote for segolene , " said vincent lamarque , 27 .
" but she was so incoherent on economic issues that i think my vote will be blank . "
regis laurand , 39 , said he would put an invalid " bayrou " ballot in the envelope .
" we must have as many blank votes as possible , " said florent sere at the end of the debate .
" that way people will understand the centre still exists . "
new-found confidence it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the disaffection of udf activists .
most ordinary people who voted for mr bayrou are likely to drift back to their original political families in the second round .
a few phone calls suggested that centrist sympathisers who had watched the debate from home in pau were happier than the party faithful about the choice before them .
gregory bonassie , a 23-year-old student , had found ms royal much more self-assured than he had expected .
" this confirms me in my readiness to vote for her , " he said .
virginie plante , 20 - another erstwhile bayrou voter who watched the debate at home - said she had been " won over " by ms royal 's robust performance .
exactly how centrists cast their votes come sunday is still anyone 's guess .
many of them still do not know .
but which ever way they turn , they will do so with little enthusiasm .
the only person who was cheered during the evening at udf quarters in pau was neither mr sarkozy nor ms royal , but the delivery boy who brought the pizzas .

centrist leader francois bayrou may have failed in his bid to make the left-right divide obsolete by reaching the run-off - but he has succeeded in hogging the limelight .
he is being courted by both socialist segolene royal and her conservative rival nicolas sarkozy .
mr bayrou has endorsed neither , leaving his 6.8m voters to make their own decision in sunday 's poll .
the question on every french mind is - which way will his crucial constituency turn ?
did the televised debate sway many french voters ?
in pictures a good place to find out is pau , mr bayrou 's south-western stronghold .
as two dozen local activists from mr bayrou 's udf party gathered at his headquarters in the city to watch wednesday 's debate between mr sarkozy and ms royal , the atmosphere was downcast but intense .
all were still struggling to accept their hero 's defeat and the end of the dream of a sea-change in french politics .
" i do n't want a centre-right and i do n't want a centre-left , i want a unifying figure who can draw from both , " said florent sere , a party activist who had come from bayonne 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- away .
watching the defectives the activists found little to choose between two candidates on offer as they watched the debate .
" i 'm torn , i really am , " julien pardon , a 30-year-old salesman from pau , said .
tv debate : excerpts rivals ' policies examined ghettos mobilise for vote like almost every person in the room , he is repelled by what he regards as mr sarkozy 's authoritarianism and fishing for far-right votes .
" his dalliance with the national front does not suit me at all , " mr pardon said , to general applause .
but he and many others are also dismayed by ms royal 's old-left rhetoric , as well as her perceived amateurism and the vagueness of her programme .
after the debate a young woman summed up the general feeling by joking : " did you prefer patrick poivre d 'arvor or arlette chabot ? " - referring to the two journalists who had moderated the encounter .
in the end , however , many - perhaps as much as a third - of the activists said ms royal was the lesser of two evils .
" we must oppose repression , " said vincent bayou , 24 - meaning mr sarkozy .
" i will vote for segolene , holding my nose . "
several agreed glumly that at least she was a tolerant figure and expressed the hope that if elected , her advisers would stop her from wrecking the economy .
' harmful ' a minority held out no such hope , and were prepared to put their deep distrust of mr sarkozy aside .
we must have as many blank votes as possible florent sere francois bayou supporter " if segolene is elected it will be a catastrophe , " frederic jourda , 40 , said after listening to both sides .
" she can do much more harm to this country that him . "
sandrine bernardin , 29 , agreed : " the president is in charge of foreign affairs .
i do n't want to be represented by segolene royal at the g8 . "
but by far the biggest single bloc in the audience was made up of those - about half of the total - who said they would cast a blank vote on sunday .
" before the debate i was ready to vote for segolene , " said vincent lamarque , 27 .
" but she was so incoherent on economic issues that i think my vote will be blank . "
regis laurand , 39 , said he would put an invalid " bayrou " ballot in the envelope .
" we must have as many blank votes as possible , " said florent sere at the end of the debate .
" that way people will understand the centre still exists . "
new-found confidence it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the disaffection of udf activists .
most ordinary people who voted for mr bayrou are likely to drift back to their original political families in the second round .
the main argument was about which candidate was worst a few phone calls suggested that centrist sympathisers who had watched the debate from home in pau were happier than the party faithful about the choice before them .
gregory bonassie , a 23-year-old student , had found ms royal much more self-assured than he had expected .
" this confirms me in my readiness to vote for her , " he said .
virginie plante , 20 - another erstwhile bayrou voter who watched the debate at home - said she had been " won over " by ms royal 's robust performance .
exactly how centrists cast their votes come sunday is still anyone 's guess .
many of them still do not know .
but which ever way they turn , they will do so with little enthusiasm .
the only person who was cheered during the evening at udf quarters in pau was neither mr sarkozy nor ms royal , but the delivery boy who brought the pizzas .

david and libby barnden came from east sussex to farm bardsey island in 2001 .
however , they are replacing like with like , and are moving to the scottish island of muck , where they will be running a b & b and growing vegetables .
the bardsey island trust now has to decide whether or not it will replace them with another tenant .
in november , the barndens said they were being squeezed off bardsey by financial circumstances beyond their control .
six years ago , the couple beat off competition from 1,100 others to win a lease of the farm on the remote island .
bardsey has no gas , electricity or running water , and the only way to get to the mainland is by fishing boat .
the barndens were due to stay on the island for 20 years .
last year , mr barnden said : " we shall be very sad to leave but at the end of the day we have to be able to make a living . "
meanwhile , for the first time , up to 15 visitors will be able to stay overnight on skomer island , off west wales , thanks to a £ 3.2m investment over the last two years .

wba secretary john taylor said a parasitic mite called varroa had virtually wiped-out wales ' wild bees .
if it were not for beekeepers , he said the ecological system would be in trouble .
he added people could do their bit by becoming beekeepers .
speaking ahead of thursday 's meeting at gelli aur college farm in llandeilo , carmarthenshire , mr taylor said : " a lot of the wild bees - the feral bees - have died out .
" we had an invasion of a mite called varroa and that attaches itself to the bees and it eventually destroys them .
" those that we have in our bee hives we are able to treat .
but the wild colonies - and there were goodness knows how many in days gone by - have been virtually wiped out .
if you want to save the planet - become a beekeeper john taylor " the vast majority of honey bees you see now belong to bee keepers . "
at the meeting association members will hear the views of britain 's chief bee inspector , richard ball .
" you need more keepers because they play a very important role in the ecological system , " added mr taylor .
" the pollination is very important for people with orchards and fruit farms etc - they will pay money for beekeepers to bring bees into the orchards at the crucial times . "
mr taylor said albert einstein once predicted that if bees were to become extinct mankind could only survive for four years .
" people have looked at this and said that was not exactly true - they 've estimated it would take seven years - but he was apparently along the right track .
" to take up bee keeping there are three things to do .
" one is to read a book .
two is to get to know a beekeeper and three is to join an association .
" if you do the latter you will soon get to know a beekeeper and they will tell you which books to read . "
he stressed beekeeping was not just a countryside activity .
" they 've been kept on top of the bank of england - i can tell you that if anyone knows that part of london there are not many fields around there .
" if you want to save the planet , become a beekeeper . "

wales ' wildlife trusts are working with about 200 landowners on the scheme , which could also boost tourism and help the environment too , it is claimed .
intensive farming since world war ii means many habitats in the area have disappeared or are in a poor condition .
called the pumlumon large areas conservation project , it is said to be one of the first of its type in the uk .
plans include reintroducing native animals such as beavers and cattle and improving habitats for water voles , otters and ground and nesting birds .

he added : " we are in a consultation period with local farmers and so far discussions have been positive .

mr thomas said one of the most interesting parts of the scheme centred on the river severn , which has its source in the cambrian mountains .
he said paying farmers to manage mountain-side peat bogs more effectively could help prevent flooding in towns along the river in wales and england .
currently , he said , water ran off the hills and straight into the river .
managing the bogs differently could mean they acted as sponges and released water drip by drip .
it is hoped the scheme would be grant-funded .

if truth is killed , the whole world will suffer , writes william horsley , head of the association of european journalists in the uk .
the killing of journalist hrant dink shocked turkey " people sometimes pay with their lives for saying out loud what they think . "
those were the words of anna politkovskaya , the russian journalist shot dead by an unknown assassin in the lift of her moscow apartment block on 7 october last year .
the killer was seen on a cctv recording , wearing a baseball cap but not hiding his face .
anna politkovskaya was a fierce critic of president putin 's government , and had received many death threats .
when she died she was working on an article alleging torture by special forces under the chechen prime minister ramzan kadyrov .
press freedom is like the canary in the coalmine jennifer windsor freedom house as in the cases of a dozen other murders of prominent russian journalists since 2000 , the investigation into her killing has so far led nowhere .
on 19 january this year hrant dink , a well-known armenian turkish writer and journalist , was shot dead in a street in istanbul .
he had received threats from turkish nationalists for writing about the mass killings of armenians by ottoman turks in world war i , and been found guilty last year on a criminal charge of " insulting turkishness " .
those deaths of famous journalists provoked an international storm .
and the kidnapping of the bbc correspondent alan johnston in gaza in march has again focussed attention on the grave threats to journalists in conflict zones .
but journalists are being killed , attacked or threatened in record numbers .
most acts of violence go unreported .
list of shame in march , a study by the international news safety institute -lrb- insi -rrb- , a coalition of media organisations and human rights groups , said 1,000 journalists had been killed around the world in the past 10 years .
the bbc 's alan johnston was abducted in gaza on 12 march the most dangerous place was iraq , with 138 killed .
russia came next , with 88 deaths .
insi 's director , rodney pinder , said : " in many countries , murder has become the easiest , cheapest and most effective way of silencing troublesome reporting . "
on world press freedom day this year , campaigners say the most deadly threat to media freedom is violence targeting journalists just because the things they may expose are unwelcome .
" press freedom suffered a continued global decline in 2006 . "
that is the conclusion of this year 's global survey by freedom house , a new york-based campaigning group .
it rated burma , cuba , libya and north korea as the world 's worst violators of media freedom .
as a region , it says the middle east and north africa has the harshest restrictions .
and a new report by the independent committee to protect journalists has published a " roll of dishonour " of places where it says press freedom has deteriorated over the past five years .
ethiopia is at the top of the list : 18 journalists have reportedly been jailed there , and the cpj says private newspapers are driven to exercise self-censorship .
next come gambia -lrb- where one newspaper editor was murdered -rrb- , russia , the democratic republic of congo , cuba , pakistan , egypt , azerbaijan , morocco and thailand .
intolerance and rigid laws the council of europe says journalists in several of its 46 member-states fear for their lives .
the council 's parliamentary assembly has protested about brutal attacks on journalists in ukraine -lrb- where the journalist georgiy gongadze was found beheaded in the year 2000 -rrb- , as well as azerbaijan and moldova .
and europe still suffers the effects of religious intolerance , which was seen in last year 's uncontrolled protests against a set of danish cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed .
the council of europe condemns iranian religious leaders for issuing " death decrees " against a frenchman and two azerbaijanis who wrote about islam .
in the former yugoslavia , too , journalists have been the targets of sectarian violence while investigating alleged war crimes , many years after the conflict ended .
the paris-based world association of newspapers raises the alarm over anti-terrorism laws which it says are stifling media freedom .
today it denounces many governments for failing to protect the press from their effects .
the association says state secrets laws have been used to convict journalists in russia and china .
in germany , the netherlands and the uk , too , journalists have faced trial for violating security laws .
bad for everyone and the media themselves are not immune from criticism .
in america , the networks and big news organisations are being asked : why did they fall for the pentagon 's false story about the heroism of private jessica lynch in iraq ?
and where was their proper scrutiny of the us government over the " war on terror " ?
commercial pressures have also brought new ownership monopolies and forced western news companies to cut their foreign news staff .
that has boosted an exciting alternative , the blogosphere .
the internet seems to promise unlimited access to information for people everywhere .
china and some other countries have moved quickly to curtail their people 's ability to use it freely .
there is some good news for the embattled media .
last december the un security council passed resolution 1738 , requiring armies and governments to protect journalists like other civilians in war zones .
and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe is pressing its 55 member-states to live up to their promises .
miklos haraszti , the osce 's representative on freedom of the media , challenged the russian authorities over anna politkovskaya 's murder , saying moscow allowed a " climate of impunity " to develop which may have led her killers to believe they would go unpunished .
" press freedom is like the canary in the coalmine , " says jennifer windsor of freedom house .
" assaults on the media are inevitably followed by assaults on other democratic institutions . "
are you a journalist or photographer in one of the areas mentioned above ?
have the risks you run in your work grown noticeably in recent years ?
send us your comments using the form below .
your comments so far : is it really any surprise that the rise of right wing and fanatical religious governments around the world would be followed by the increased attack on and undermining of the press ?
when in history have dictators and theocrats been the friend of the free press ?
the very idea of a free press is a liberal idea .
kenny , usa how about in sri lanka ?
up to now at least 60 tamil journalists are killed and no one is interested .
even sinhalese journalists are warned not to write anything against the government or the truth .
why do n't you all publish a list of the countries and number of journalists killed by their government ?
ganesan chitsabesan , london uk journalists in manila , philippines will be lighting candles and reading poems to honour the 51 journalists murdered in three years since our current president assumed power in 2001 .
does n't that make the philippines a very dangerous place for journalists ?
james , manila , philippines it seems that there is a warped view of democracy in europe and russia in which journalists can report on what they like on condition that they have to satisfy a certain group of people who are actually intolerant of other people 's views .
this is becoming an increasing problem in russia where you have to report only good things or be vulnerable to attack from pro-kremlin activists or state-sponsored thugs in the guise of the paramilitary youth group - nashi .
however , there is a key difference between exposing corruption and having a different point of view on such topics and intervening in the private lives of famous people and business leaders .
mark dixey , zürich / moscow sadly enough , ethiopia is losing the ground for the growth of press freedom and hopefully the window will open with painstaking struggle .
abebe , addis i am a young broadcast journalist with one of the leading tv stations in ghana , and although i do not report from any of the stated regions , i feel a bit uncomfortable with the thought of a fellow journalist being killed for what they trained and studied years to do !
i have always dreamt of being in the eye of news worthy region to report to the world but now i really have jitters over the mere thought .
it 's about time they put measures in place to protect journalists .
but then again , what can they do ?
nana yaa brago , accra , ghana harassment and veiled threats so far , no overt violence but continuous monitoring of my affairs , hence my reticence to reveal my name .
i am reasonably well connected within the kazakh elite community and therefore have some support .
however people with similar connections to me have diappeared ...
withheld , almaty , kazakhstan no mention of afghanistan ?
at least two media workers were killed by the taliban this year and several more have been threatened .
going to the frontlines is nearly impossible because of the threat of kidnappings , and security forces , including the us military block access , shoot at journalists and confiscate media cameras .
meanwhile the government and parliament are trying to limit press freedoms .
the risks have grown noticeably in the last three years .

if truth is killed , the whole world will suffer , writes william horsley , head of the association of european journalists in the uk .
the killing of journalist hrant dink shocked turkey " people sometimes pay with their lives for saying out loud what they think . "
those were the words of anna politkovskaya , the russian journalist shot dead by an unknown assassin in the lift of her moscow apartment block on 7 october last year .
the killer was seen on a cctv recording , wearing a baseball cap but not hiding his face .
anna politkovskaya was a fierce critic of president putin 's government , and had received many death threats .
when she died she was working on an article alleging torture by special forces under the chechen prime minister ramzan kadyrov .
press freedom is like the canary in the coalmine jennifer windsor freedom house as in the cases of a dozen other murders of prominent russian journalists since 2000 , the investigation into her killing has so far led nowhere .
on 19 january this year hrant dink , a well-known armenian turkish writer and journalist , was shot dead in a street in istanbul .
he had received threats from turkish nationalists for writing about the mass killings of armenians by ottoman turks in world war i , and been found guilty last year on a criminal charge of " insulting turkishness " .
those deaths of famous journalists provoked an international storm .
and the kidnapping of the bbc correspondent alan johnston in gaza in march has again focussed attention on the grave threats to journalists in conflict zones .
but journalists are being killed , attacked or threatened in record numbers .
most acts of violence go unreported .
list of shame in march , a study by the international news safety institute -lrb- insi -rrb- , a coalition of media organisations and human rights groups , said 1,000 journalists had been killed around the world in the past 10 years .
the bbc 's alan johnston was abducted in gaza on 12 march the most dangerous place was iraq , with 138 killed .
russia came next , with 88 deaths .
insi 's director , rodney pinder , said : " in many countries , murder has become the easiest , cheapest and most effective way of silencing troublesome reporting . "
on world press freedom day this year , campaigners say the most deadly threat to media freedom is violence targeting journalists just because the things they may expose are unwelcome .
" press freedom suffered a continued global decline in 2006 . "
that is the conclusion of this year 's global survey by freedom house , a new york-based campaigning group .
it rated burma , cuba , libya and north korea as the world 's worst violators of media freedom .
as a region , it says the middle east and north africa has the harshest restrictions .
and a new report by the independent committee to protect journalists has published a " roll of dishonour " of places where it says press freedom has deteriorated over the past five years .
ethiopia is at the top of the list : 18 journalists have reportedly been jailed there , and the cpj says private newspapers are driven to exercise self-censorship .
next come gambia -lrb- where one newspaper editor was murdered -rrb- , russia , the democratic republic of congo , cuba , pakistan , egypt , azerbaijan , morocco and thailand .
intolerance and rigid laws the council of europe says journalists in several of its 46 member-states fear for their lives .

bad for everyone and the media themselves are not immune from criticism .
in america , the networks and big news organisations are being asked : why did they fall for the pentagon 's false story about the heroism of private jessica lynch in iraq ?
and where was their proper scrutiny of the us government over the " war on terror " ?
commercial pressures have also brought new ownership monopolies and forced western news companies to cut their foreign news staff .
that has boosted an exciting alternative , the blogosphere .
the internet seems to promise unlimited access to information for people everywhere .
china and some other countries have moved quickly to curtail their people 's ability to use it freely .
there is some good news for the embattled media .
last december the un security council passed resolution 1738 , requiring armies and governments to protect journalists like other civilians in war zones .
and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe is pressing its 55 member-states to live up to their promises .
miklos haraszti , the osce 's representative on freedom of the media , challenged the russian authorities over anna politkovskaya 's murder , saying moscow allowed a " climate of impunity " to develop which may have led her killers to believe they would go unpunished .
" press freedom is like the canary in the coalmine , " says jennifer windsor of freedom house .
" assaults on the media are inevitably followed by assaults on other democratic institutions . "
are you a journalist or photographer in one of the areas mentioned above ?
have the risks you run in your work grown noticeably in recent years ?
send us your comments using the form below .
your comments so far : is it really any surprise that the rise of right wing and fanatical religious governments around the world would be followed by the increased attack on and undermining of the press ?
when in history have dictators and theocrats been the friend of the free press ?
the very idea of a free press is a liberal idea .
kenny , usa how about in sri lanka ?
up to now at least 60 tamil journalists are killed and no one is interested .
even sinhalese journalists are warned not to write anything against the government or the truth .
why do n't you all publish a list of the countries and number of journalists killed by their government ?
ganesan chitsabesan , london uk journalists in manila , philippines will be lighting candles and reading poems to honour the 51 journalists murdered in three years since our current president assumed power in 2001 .
does n't that make the philippines a very dangerous place for journalists ?
james , manila , philippines it seems that there is a warped view of democracy in europe and russia in which journalists can report on what they like on condition that they have to satisfy a certain group of people who are actually intolerant of other people 's views .
this is becoming an increasing problem in russia where you have to report only good things or be vulnerable to attack from pro-kremlin activists or state-sponsored thugs in the guise of the paramilitary youth group - nashi .
however , there is a key difference between exposing corruption and having a different point of view on such topics and intervening in the private lives of famous people and business leaders .
mark dixey , zürich / moscow sadly enough , ethiopia is losing the ground for the growth of press freedom and hopefully the window will open with painstaking struggle .
abebe , addis i am a young broadcast journalist with one of the leading tv stations in ghana , and although i do not report from any of the stated regions , i feel a bit uncomfortable with the thought of a fellow journalist being killed for what they trained and studied years to do !

it 's about time they put measures in place to protect journalists .
but then again , what can they do ?
nana yaa brago , accra , ghana harassment and veiled threats so far , no overt violence but continuous monitoring of my affairs , hence my reticence to reveal my name .
i am reasonably well connected within the kazakh elite community and therefore have some support .
however people with similar connections to me have diappeared ...
withheld , almaty , kazakhstan no mention of afghanistan ?
at least two media workers were killed by the taliban this year and several more have been threatened .
going to the frontlines is nearly impossible because of the threat of kidnappings , and security forces , including the us military block access , shoot at journalists and confiscate media cameras .
meanwhile the government and parliament are trying to limit press freedoms .
the risks have grown noticeably in the last three years .

a warrant for gere 's arrest was issued last week for " obscene " behaviour after the televised embrace .
the star bent shetty backwards on stage and kissed her repeatedly .
the incident triggered controversy in india , known for its conservative attitudes , despite bollywood 's sexually suggestive song-and-dance routines .
the incident occurred when gere and shetty were appearing at an aids-awareness event in delhi .
gere apologised last month for causing offence over the incident .
speaking in australia , where she is promoting her latest film , shetty said that the kisses episode had been " blown out of all proportion " and that gere " was just being very sweet " .
" the media tends to get slightly irresponsible at times but that 's the price one has to pay for celebrity , " she said .
meanwhile the magistrate who issued an arrest warrant against gere has been transferred .
officials confirmed to the bbc that judge dinesh gupta has been moved from his post in jaipur to the town of kishangarh several hours away .
they said that the transfer was " routine " and was for " administrative reasons " .
the judge 's arrest order drew harsh criticism in india , with senior lawyers arguing it had no legal merit .

a warrant for gere 's arrest was issued last week for " obscene " behaviour after the televised embrace .
the star bent shetty backwards on stage and kissed her repeatedly .
the incident triggered controversy in india , known for its conservative attitudes , despite bollywood 's sexually suggestive song-and-dance routines .
the incident occurred when gere and shetty were appearing at an aids-awareness event in delhi .
gere apologised last month for causing offence over the incident .
speaking in australia , where she is promoting her latest film , shetty said that the kisses episode had been " blown out of all proportion " and that gere " was just being very sweet " .
" the media tends to get slightly irresponsible at times but that 's the price one has to pay for celebrity , " she said .
meanwhile the magistrate who issued an arrest warrant against gere has been transferred .
officials confirmed to the bbc that judge dinesh gupta has been moved from his post in jaipur to the town of kishangarh several hours away .
they said that the transfer was " routine " and was for " administrative reasons " .
the judge 's arrest order drew harsh criticism in india , with senior lawyers arguing it had no legal merit .

seats on the scottish parliament and local councils , the welsh assembly and most local authorities in england outside london are all up for grabs .
what 's happening in scotland ?
this may sees the four-yearly elections for the scottish parliament , which runs the devolved scottish government .
seats on all 32 unitary councils will be up for election as well .
election day - how to vote guide what powers does the scottish parliament have ?
it can pass laws on education , criminal justice , the nhs , business , agriculture , local government , social housing , transport and tourism and some other areas .
it also has the power to vary the basic rate of income tax , set by westminster to cover the whole uk , by up to 3 % .
westminster retains control of areas like foreign policy , immigration , defence , social security , employment and national security .
who controls the scottish parliament ?
it is controlled by a labour / liberal democrat coalition .
labour has 50 seats , the scottish national party has 25 , the lib dems and conservatives both have 17 , the scottish greens have seven , the scottish socialists have 4 , solidarity - the socialist party set up by tommy sheridan - has two , the scottish senior citizens unity party has one and there are five independents and one presiding officer .
there are also 32 local unitary authorities , which run local government services .
from may 2007 they will be elected using the single transferable vote .
how are msps elected ?
msps are elected for four-year terms , by the " top up " system - a type of proportional representation .
there are 129 msps at holyrood .
73 are constituency msps , 56 are regional " top-up " members .
voters have two votes - one for a candidate in a constituency , and the second for a party - from this vote the " top-up " members are picked .
what is happening in wales ?
this may sees the four-yearly elections for the welsh assembly .
this runs the devolved government of wales .
guide to voting what powers does the welsh assembly have ?
it can pass secondary legislation in some areas - meaning it can modify acts of parliament using assembly orders - but not make new acts itself .
it can modify the details of acts in areas including : agriculture , the environment , roads and transport , housing , social services , health , tourism and social services .
it does not have tax-raising powers but has some powers over government charges for services - like nhs prescriptions , charges for nursing homes and university tuition .
is n't it getting more powers after the elections ?
yes .
under the government of wales act 2006 - it will be able to make assembly measures - effectively passing laws , but only over those areas where it already has responsibility .
these will also be subject to a westminster veto - the houses of commons and lords will have to vote in favour of allowing the assembly to legislate in those areas .
the idea is to bypass the legislative " log jam " at westminster , where laws prepared by the welsh assembly have to compete for time with bills prepared in whitehall .
the act also allows for the possibility of a referendum , to grant full law-making powers to the welsh assembly .
who controls the welsh assembly ?
labour is the ruling party - although it was a minority government for much of the last term - and the first minister is rhodri morgan .
there are 60 members of the assembly -lrb- ams -rrb- , based in cardiff , each elected for four years .
labour has 29 seats , plaid cymru has 12 , the conservatives have 11 , the liberal democrats have 6 seats and there are two independents , john marek and trish law .
the assembly is quite unusual as the executive -lrb- the government -rrb- and the parliamentary -lrb- legislative -rrb- branches are not legally separate - but integrated as a corporate body .
the government of wales act aims to change this .
how are ams elected ?
there are 40 ams representing individual constituencies through the " first past the post " system , and five more regions elect another 20 from regional lists - a type of proportional representation .
everyone has two votes - one to elect a constituency member and one vote to elect a regional member - the second vote is for a political party , not an individual .
currently ams delegate their executive powers to the first minister , who is elected by the whole assembly .
he gives responsibility for certain functions to the cabinet - made up of eight ministers .
what elections are there in england ?
in england 32.8 million people will be able to vote - with seats being contested in 312 local authorities .
in some councils one third of seats will be up for election , in others , the whole council will be elected .
there are also mayoral elections in bedford , mansfield and middlesbrough .
it is the biggest election in the local cycle in england , with about 10,500 council seats are up for grabs .
this is because councils which are electing all their members have coincided with those electing one-third of councillors .
elections are disproportionately in councils from the more rural and suburban areas of england - this year half of the seats are in just three of nine regions - eastern , south and south-west .
english council elections in full guide : england 's local elections directly-elected mayors what powers do local councils have ?
they vary between the different types of authorities .
but powers can include setting council tax , as well as charges for things like parking tickets , overseeing street-cleaning , maintaining roads and parks , running libraries and schools , refuse collection , housing and social services , trading standards and environmental health - from fly tipping to noise pollution - and they grant planning permission for buildings .
when are the elections ?
the elections will be held on thursday 3 may 2007 .
polls open at 7am and close at 10pm .
when will the results be known ?
in england , 169 of the 312 councils where seats are being contested have decided to delay their counts until friday - rather than starting straight after polls close and counting into the early hours .
this is largely because of new rules on postal votes which require election officers to double check at least 20 % of signatures - but preferably 100 % - accompanying ballot papers with those on the original applications for a postal vote .
it means a clear picture of the results will be unlikely to be available before friday afternoon .
in wales counts are expected to take place overnight .
in scotland the first results are expected at about 12.30am e-mail this to a friend search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

king 's college london scientists , plus doctors at guy 's and st thomas ' hospital , hope to include 480 children in the seven-year study .
the babies being studied are between four and 11 months and already have eczema or egg allergy , putting them at high risk of being allergic to peanuts .
peanut allergy is increasingly common , affecting one in 70 schoolchildren .
our study findings may result in a change in public health policy to prevent food allergies professor gideon link levels have doubled in the uk over the last 10 years .
current guidelines advise women to avoid nuts during pregnancy if there is a family history of allergy .
this group is also advised not to give their babies peanuts before they are three-years-old .
it is currently not clear how to prevent peanut allergy .
some studies suggest that peanut avoidance in early infancy may help to prevent allergy , whereas other research suggests the opposite may be true .
' clinical implications ' professor gideon lack , who will be leading the leap -lrb- learning early about peanut allergies -rrb- study , has been looking into the subject for many years .
he said : " recent evidence suggests that children who eat peanut snacks early in life may in fact be protected against peanut allergy , in contrast with previous studies which have suggested the opposite . "
in the study , the babies will be divided into two groups .
one will receive a peanut snack regularly for the first three years of life , whereas the control group will completely avoid peanuts .
both groups will be assessed for peanut allergy when they are five-years-old .
professor lack said , " determining whether avoidance or early exposure to peanut prevents the development of peanut allergy and understanding how this happens will have important clinical implications .
" our study findings may result in a change in public health policy to prevent food allergies and will enable scientists to identify important treatment targets to try and develop cures for children who already suffer from peanut allergy . "
anyone who has a baby of the right age who is interested in taking part in the study can contact the researchers on 0800 234 6522 or email info @ leapstudy.co.uk.

the police-accompanied inspections were carried out by the human fertilisation and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- with a court warrant .
the hfea says this is part of regulatory action and that it has been contacted by a whistleblower .
one of the clinics was secretly filmed by panorama offering unproven treatment to women , potentially risking health .
ivf undercover , which was broadcast on bbc one on monday night , has undercover footage from the assisted reproductive and gynaecology centre -lrb- argc -rrb- , run by mohamed taranissi who has produced 2,300 babies in seven years .
but he also ran an unlicensed clinic from december 2005 for almost a year .
get expert help send us your views the chief executive of the hfea angela mcnab told a news conference : " for some time the hfea has been taking regulatory action against the clinics run by mr taranissi .
whilst we have tried to work with his clinics to get the information we require to do our job we have been challenged by his clinic and his lawyers at almost every step of the way .
" information has continued to come to light during this process and this morning i was able to go to court to secure a warrant .
this will allow us to gain unimpeded access to the clinics run by mr taranissi .
" as we speak two inspection teams from the hfea have gone simultaneously into these two clinics with police officers in attendance to carry out an unannounced inspection of the two buildings and to secure the information that we need and are entitled to under the law .
" we 've received information from whistle blowers who appear to have been working in the centre .
" and we 're also aware of the separate allegations made in the bbc panorama programme which will need investigation . "
" mr taranissi welcomes the hfea 's decision to allow him to continue his important work , and wants to reassure all his patients that he will not let any of this affect the level of treatment and care they are receiving " mr taranissi 's statement defending ivf doctor mr taranissi gave a statement in response to the hfea inspections .
he said : " we can confirm that inspectors from the hfea and the healthcare commission visited argc and rgi today .
" mohamed taranissi cooperated fully with the inspection team and will continue to do so .
" mr taranissi is happy to make all records available to the hfea as he has never had anything to hide .
" mr taranissi is confident that hfea checks on his records will lead to them reconfirming what they have always said in the past - that his methods work , as shown by his clinics topping their league tables for patient results every year since 1995 .
" mr taranissi welcomes the hfea 's decision to allow him to continue his important work , and wants to reassure all his patients that he will not let any of this affect the level of treatment and care they are receiving . "
and he has rejected the criticisms levelled at him in panorama .
fertility experts viewed panorama 's footage from the argc .
' makes you weep ' watching some of the footage , lord robert winston said : " it makes you weep for the medical profession .
it 's a failure of regulation . "
but mr taranissi , whose wealth is calculated to be £ 38m , told panorama after the undercover filming : " there 's a lot of regulations that seem to apply to us more than other people .
" we 're not against regulation , we just hope that we can finish with this and move forwards for everybody because it takes a lot of time from my time which i need to devote to patients because that 's what i am good at and that 's what i want to continue to do - provide results for people . "
the experts watched panorama 's secret filming and said they were disturbed when they saw : a 26-year-old undercover reporter offered ivf treatment at the argc , which could cost her up to £ 10,000 in some circumstances , even though neither she nor her partner had any history of fertility problems .
a second undercover patient with a similar medical status is correctly told that at her age she does not require treatment the 26-year-old was then offered a treatment involving a blood transfusion of a concentrated mix of human antibodies .
one expert said it was impossible to know what the antibodies could do to a baby blood tests costing £ 780 involving 18 phials of blood from the arm of the 26-year-old which the experts describe as incapable of revealing fertility problems a senior clinician telling the reporter her blood test revealed levels which indicated treatment but one expert analysed the results as " all completely normal " panorama also found out that mr taranissi was risking a jail term by continuing to carry out ivf treatments at a second clinic called the reproductive genetics institute -lrb- rgi -rrb- which no longer has a licence .
unlicensed clinic it was not renewed at the end of 2005 due to a lack of required data .
it is a criminal offence to operate in an unlicensed clinic .
using the freedom of information act , panorama obtained figures showing how mr taranissi treats some older women at the rgi .
the birth rates there are consistently much lower than the argc .
mr taranissi says this is because they require specific treatments and not because this helps boost his success rate at his main clinic .
mr taranissi said : " the panorama programme is wrong on many key facts .
" the programme makers question the efficacy of immune testing in ivf , yet i am open about the fact that it is indeed one reason for my success rates .
" panorama says that my second clinic , rgi , operated for a while without a licence .
as explained to them , this is a matter of legal dispute .
" the clinic in question was offered a three-year licence .
on the form accepting this , i said i wish to make representations .
" the hfea regulator seemed to interpret this two months later as me declining the licence , and the matter has been with the lawyers ever since . "
the chair of the british fertility society , mark hamilton , said : " we ca n't comment on any individual case but any exploitation of distressed and vulnerable patients is absolutely unacceptable .
" the fertility sector is probably the most regulated sector in uk medicine and the hfea has said today that the vast majority of clinics in the uk comply well with these standards .
" as a society we expect our members to uphold high standards .
we support innovation where treatment is in the framework of a properly conducted , ethically approved clinical trial . "

the report into pte jason smith 's death in 2003 also called for tougher medical checks on ta troops going to war zones .
an earlier inquest heard how he died of heat stroke when his body temperature soared to 41.1c -lrb- 105.98f -rrb- .
the army report said he was " at the higher level of obese " at 17 stones .
his family has rejected those claims saying he was fit and healthy .
the army board of inquiry 's report said pte smith 's body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- , which measures height against weight , was dangerously high at 34 . "
the real story here is the soldiers were being put in extremely dangerous conditions " jocelyn cockburn solicitor " a bmi of above 30 is generally taken as a point at which health becomes an issue , " it said .
" it is the opinion of the board that pte smith 's death was caused by a number of factors .
" these were the fact that he was very overweight , his probable lack of fitness , the extreme temperatures and lack of air conditioning . "
the report called for tougher medical checks for ta troops being sent out to war zones .
existing tests on reservists do not always measure medical fitness and , unlike regular forces , they can still be sent if they fail .
however , the soldier 's mother , catherine smith , said her son took his job and fitness seriously and rejected claims he was obese .
' let down ' " i feel so let down by the army , " she said .
" they are to blame for his death because they made him and the other boys live in unbearable conditions without air conditioning and proper medical facilities .
" the boys were dropping like flies from the heat but the army have tried to cover it up . "
her solicitor jocelyn cockburn said pte smith was a " good soldier " .

the report into pte jason smith 's death in 2003 also called for tougher medical checks on ta troops going to war zones .
an earlier inquest heard how he died of heat stroke when his body temperature soared to 41.1c -lrb- 105.98f -rrb- .
the army report said he was " at the higher level of obese " at 17 stones .
his family has rejected those claims saying he was fit and healthy .
the army board of inquiry 's report said pte smith 's body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- , which measures height against weight , was dangerously high at 34 .
the real story here is the soldiers were being put in extremely dangerous conditions jocelyn cockburn solicitor " a bmi of above 30 is generally taken as a point at which health becomes an issue , " it said .
" it is the opinion of the board that pte smith 's death was caused by a number of factors .
" these were the fact that he was very overweight , his probable lack of fitness , the extreme temperatures and lack of air conditioning . "
the report called for tougher medical checks for ta troops being sent out to war zones .
existing tests on reservists do not always measure medical fitness and , unlike regular forces , they can still be sent if they fail .
however , the soldier 's mother , catherine smith , said her son took his job and fitness seriously and rejected claims he was obese .
' let down ' " i feel so let down by the army , " she said .
" they are to blame for his death because they made him and the other boys live in unbearable conditions without air conditioning and proper medical facilities .
" the boys were dropping like flies from the heat but the army have tried to cover it up . "
her solicitor jocelyn cockburn said pte smith was a " good soldier " .
" this is not because one soldier was or was not overweight , " she said .

" they all thought that i 'd taken leave of my senses , " archaeologist bill kelso told me when we met by the james river .
" everyone , " he said , " believed that the jamestown fort of 1607 had been washed away and lost to the river " .
" when i started to dig in 1993 my archaeological expedition had a staff of one and that was me . "
bill kelso led me to the river bank where he began to dig with a trowel in 1993 .
" quite near the surface i struck some pieces of pottery and a clay pipe .
i 'd seen the same sort of thing on 17th century sites in england so i kept digging , " he said .
archaeological remains by 2003 , archaeologists had revealed the remains of the triangular palisade and the towers of the fort which the settlers had built in only 19 days .
half of them died soon after from heat and exhaustion .
the fort is just over one acre in size and is packed with archaeological remains .
they found the foundations of elizabethan half-timbered houses with thatched roofs .
more than 750,000 artefacts have been recovered from the site - the site that was not supposed to be there .
another archaeologist came up with a paper sack full of things he had found that morning . "
historians in the 19th century were looking for a more noble beginning and opted for the pilgrim fathers .
they landed in plymouth in 1620 - 13 years after jamestown " bly straube , museum curator he tipped them out on a trestle table - pottery shards , clay pipes and short lengths of greenish looking metal .
" that 's copper , " bill kelso explained .
" they had this , along with beads , to trade with the indians . "
the first settlers had among them the younger sons of gentry families who kept up appearances and continued to dress like gentlemen .
buttons from jackets give a clue to the quality of their clothes .
one personal item must have belonged to a man of means .
it is made of silver , about two inches long and in the shape of a dolphin .
coming out of the dolphin 's mouth is a curved pick used to clean teeth - while the other end - at the tail of the dolphin , there is a tiny silver spoon used for getting wax out of gentlemen 's ears .
damp conditions the queen will see some of the finest objects that are now in the newly opened site museum which the americans curiously call an archaearium .
one exhibition is a reconstruction of a deep well that was packed with stuff that had fallen in or been thrown away .
there were parts of a suit of armour - a breast plate and helmet .
there was an axe head and other iron tools .
part of a bucket and rope survived , loads of pottery and the remains of deer and fish bones .
the damp conditions in the well meant that everything including leather shoes had been preserved .
jamestown as a settlement had always been known to historians .
it is the discovery of layers of objects that add such an important new dimension to the story of the founding of english america that is new .

english settlers trade with indians in the fort at jamestown " they all thought that i 'd taken leave of my senses , " archaeologist bill kelso told me when we met by the james river .
" everyone , " he said , " believed that the jamestown fort of 1607 had been washed away and lost to the river " .
" when i started to dig in 1993 my archaeological expedition had a staff of one and that was me . "
bill kelso led me to the river bank where he began to dig with a trowel in 1993 .
" quite near the surface i struck some pieces of pottery and a clay pipe .
i 'd seen the same sort of thing on 17th century sites in england so i kept digging , " he said .
archaeological remains by 2003 , archaeologists had revealed the remains of the triangular palisade and the towers of the fort which the settlers had built in only 19 days .
half of them died soon after from heat and exhaustion .
the fort is just over one acre in size and is packed with archaeological remains .
they found the foundations of elizabethan half-timbered houses with thatched roofs .
more than 750,000 artefacts have been recovered from the site - the site that was not supposed to be there .
another archaeologist came up with a paper sack full of things he had found that morning .
historians in the 19th century were looking for a more noble beginning and opted for the pilgrim fathers .
they landed in plymouth in 1620 - 13 years after jamestown bly straube , museum curator he tipped them out on a trestle table - pottery shards , clay pipes and short lengths of greenish looking metal .
" that 's copper , " bill kelso explained .
" they had this , along with beads , to trade with the indians . "
the first settlers had among them the younger sons of gentry families who kept up appearances and continued to dress like gentlemen .
buttons from jackets give a clue to the quality of their clothes .
one personal item must have belonged to a man of means .
it is made of silver , about two inches long and in the shape of a dolphin .
coming out of the dolphin 's mouth is a curved pick used to clean teeth - while the other end - at the tail of the dolphin , there is a tiny silver spoon used for getting wax out of gentlemen 's ears .
damp conditions the queen will see some of the finest objects that are now in the newly opened site museum which the americans curiously call an archaearium .
one exhibition is a reconstruction of a deep well that was packed with stuff that had fallen in or been thrown away .
there were parts of a suit of armour - a breast plate and helmet .
there was an axe head and other iron tools .
part of a bucket and rope survived , loads of pottery and the remains of deer and fish bones .
