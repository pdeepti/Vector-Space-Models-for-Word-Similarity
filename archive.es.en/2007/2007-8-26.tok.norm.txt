" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .
irmgard von stephani , a berlin resident who will be 112 on sept .
20 , is the oldest german alive . centenarian boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the mind and body active is key to longevity every year , german president horst köhler sends a personal congratulatory note to every centenarian and starting at 105 , a birthday greeting every year .
in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity . " a person must be happy , " she said .
" those who are satisfied with their lives live longer . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman looks on the fire approaching houses in evia island " we are optimistic that , if the weather and the reduction in the winds hold long enough , we may be able to be more effective , " fire department spokesman nikos diamandis said , adding that it was impossible to say exactly how large an area had burnt or how many homes had been destroyed .
" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .
homes were burning , electricity had been cut and the fire had reached the olympia museum in front of the shrine to zeus , officials said .
fires have also been reported raging near the port town of kalamata and near sparta on the southeastern part of the peninsula and near corinth in the north .
another fire has been reported on euboea , greece 's second-largest island .
asking for help greece asked for european union assistance on friday , in particular for water-bombing aircraft , and the european commission , through its community mechanism for civil protection , put out urgent calls to the 30 countries that participate in the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villages are being devoured by flames " it 's a critical situation ... much worse than ours , " said italy 's public-safety chief guido bertolaso .
" even though we are still in the middle of an emergency in italy , we can not be deaf to the greek government 's appeal . "
the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .
the death toll from the greek fires climbed on saturday as search parties of soldiers and firefighters discovered more charred bodies in cars , homes and the countryside .
call for unity " i am saddened by the tragic loss of human lives that these forest fires have brought with them and hope that the european partners will live up to expectations and provide all the material support greece needs in this moment of distress , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's prime minister kostas karamanlis says arsonists are responsible for the disaster " i am distressed that europe 's southern shores are once again experiencing climatic conditions that favor the spread of these fires .
i am convinced that we need to strengthen our forest firefighting capacity to combat these fires together , " added eu environment and civil protection commissioner stavros dimas .
it marks the fourth appeal by greece to its eu partners since june for help in combating forest fires , which have spread due to several heat waves and months of drought .
prime minister kostas karamanlis has blamed arsonists for the latest inferno and police have so far arrested seven people in connection with the blazes . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a three-kilometer exclusion zone was set up around the farm , near the city of erlangen which is about 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- north of munich , as officials began tracking down the cause of the infection .

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .
irmgard von stephani , a berlin resident who will be 112 on sept .

in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity .

flames have now reached the village of olympia , next to the ancient ruins there . international help has begun to arrive as greece tries to cope with wildfires raging out of control on the peloponnesian peninsula , with the death toll by latest count reaching 53 , officials said .
a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman looks on the fire approaching houses in evia island " we are optimistic that , if the weather and the reduction in the winds hold long enough , we may be able to be more effective , " fire department spokesman nikos diamandis said , adding that it was impossible to say exactly how large an area had burnt or how many homes had been destroyed .
" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .
homes were burning , electricity had been cut and the fire had reached the olympia museum in front of the shrine to zeus , officials said .
fires have also been reported raging near the port town of kalamata and near sparta on the southeastern part of the peninsula and near corinth in the north .
another fire has been reported on euboea , greece 's second-largest island .

" even though we are still in the middle of an emergency in italy , we can not be deaf to the greek government 's appeal . "
the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .
the death toll from the greek fires climbed on saturday as search parties of soldiers and firefighters discovered more charred bodies in cars , homes and the countryside .
call for unity " i am saddened by the tragic loss of human lives that these forest fires have brought with them and hope that the european partners will live up to expectations and provide all the material support greece needs in this moment of distress , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's prime minister kostas karamanlis says arsonists are responsible for the disaster " i am distressed that europe 's southern shores are once again experiencing climatic conditions that favor the spread of these fires .
i am convinced that we need to strengthen our forest firefighting capacity to combat these fires together , " added eu environment and civil protection commissioner stavros dimas .
it marks the fourth appeal by greece to its eu partners since june for help in combating forest fires , which have spread due to several heat waves and months of drought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.08.2007 state funding for germany 's political parties under scrutiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties say they need more cash new proposals for reforming the system of government funding of german political parties have provoked a storm of criticism . in germany , the legitimization of political parties is set out in article 21 of the country 's constitution , known as the basic law . this states that " political parties shall participate in the formation of the political will of the people . they may be freely established .
their internal organization must conform to democratic principles . they must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds . " if parties are to participate effectively in the formation of the political will of the people , some kind of state funding is required . there has long been disagreement over what form this should take and a new debate has arisen after fresh proposals by the parties making up the ruling grand coalition were made . in germany , if you want to join a political party you have to pay a regular membership fee .
however these fees alone are not sufficient for the parties ' needs and they receive additional financing from tax revenues . success ratio the precise amount each party receives depends on the extent to which it is rooted within society . in other words , the size of the tax contribution is calculated on the basis of a party 's electoral success and on how many registered members it has .
at present , germany 's political parties receive some 133 million euros -lrb- $ 181 million -rrb- from tax revenues . but calls for this to be increased are growing louder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties are n't cheap to run for some time now germany 's two largest parties , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been losing members .
the result is that income from membership fees has declined , which in turn has led to their receiving a smaller share of tax revenue . this has prompted the current cdu / spd governing coalition to propose an increase in the amount of financing from taxes . recent media reports that quoted a figure of up to 15 percent unleashed a storm of protest from opposition politicians and constitutional experts . do n't tamper with the constitution ! volker beck of the environmentalist green party advises against " bringing into question the basic principles of the established laws governing political parties in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands off the basic law ! says volker beck hans herbert von arnim , an expert in constitutional law , agreed , saying it would be wrong to use the decline in the number of party members as an argument . " to make the taxpayers pay for this is a reversal of responsibility , " he said . similar comments have come from reiner holznagel of the german taxpayers ' federation . " the taxpayer should not be penalized for the fact that the parties are losing members , " he said . " the parties should come up with other ideas - and above all they need to find ways to cut costs . " cutbacks this is something the cdu and spd have been doing for years .
they 've cut back on staff , holiday pay and salary increases .
but this has not been enough to offset the decline in funds coming in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of money a party gets from the government depends how well it does among voters however , the force of the current criticism has resulted in a flurry of denials from leading members of both parties that they were envisaging an increase of as much as 15 percent . the likely solution is that state funding for political parties will be brought into line with the increase in costs generally . according to current legislation , any increase in state subsidies should be pegged to a price index which the federal statistics office presents to parliament each year . current figures indicate that the parties would be entitled to an increase of 5.9 percent which is around 7.8 million euros . that should go some way towards easing their situation and calm the fears of those who had feared an attack on the constitution . dw staff -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tests by the friedrich loeffler institute of veterinary medicine had found the lethal strain of the virus in five of the birds .
a three-kilometer exclusion zone was set up around the farm , near the city of erlangen which is about 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- north of munich , as officials began tracking down the cause of the infection .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tests determined that birds at the poultry farm died of the h5n1 strain of bird flu " we have not been able to pinpoint the source of outbreak , " said bavarian health secretary otmar bernhard .

most of the victims have been in asia .

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .
irmgard von stephani , a berlin resident who will be 112 on sept .
20 , is the oldest german alive . centenarian boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the mind and body active is key to longevity every year , german president horst köhler sends a personal congratulatory note to every centenarian and starting at 105 , a birthday greeting every year .
in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity .

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .
irmgard von stephani , a berlin resident who will be 112 on sept .

in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity .

their internal organization must conform to democratic principles . they must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds . " if parties are to participate effectively in the formation of the political will of the people , some kind of state funding is required . there has long been disagreement over what form this should take and a new debate has arisen after fresh proposals by the parties making up the ruling grand coalition were made . in germany , if you want to join a political party you have to pay a regular membership fee .
however these fees alone are not sufficient for the parties ' needs and they receive additional financing from tax revenues . success ratio the precise amount each party receives depends on the extent to which it is rooted within society . in other words , the size of the tax contribution is calculated on the basis of a party 's electoral success and on how many registered members it has .
at present , germany 's political parties receive some 133 million euros -lrb- $ 181 million -rrb- from tax revenues . but calls for this to be increased are growing louder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties are n't cheap to run for some time now germany 's two largest parties , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been losing members .
the result is that income from membership fees has declined , which in turn has led to their receiving a smaller share of tax revenue . this has prompted the current cdu / spd governing coalition to propose an increase in the amount of financing from taxes . recent media reports that quoted a figure of up to 15 percent unleashed a storm of protest from opposition politicians and constitutional experts . do n't tamper with the constitution ! volker beck of the environmentalist green party advises against " bringing into question the basic principles of the established laws governing political parties in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands off the basic law ! says volker beck hans herbert von arnim , an expert in constitutional law , agreed , saying it would be wrong to use the decline in the number of party members as an argument . " to make the taxpayers pay for this is a reversal of responsibility , " he said . similar comments have come from reiner holznagel of the german taxpayers ' federation . " the taxpayer should not be penalized for the fact that the parties are losing members , " he said . " the parties should come up with other ideas - and above all they need to find ways to cut costs . " cutbacks this is something the cdu and spd have been doing for years .
they 've cut back on staff , holiday pay and salary increases .
but this has not been enough to offset the decline in funds coming in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of money a party gets from the government depends how well it does among voters however , the force of the current criticism has resulted in a flurry of denials from leading members of both parties that they were envisaging an increase of as much as 15 percent . the likely solution is that state funding for political parties will be brought into line with the increase in costs generally . according to current legislation , any increase in state subsidies should be pegged to a price index which the federal statistics office presents to parliament each year . current figures indicate that the parties would be entitled to an increase of 5.9 percent which is around 7.8 million euros . that should go some way towards easing their situation and calm the fears of those who had feared an attack on the constitution . dw staff -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

flames have now reached the village of olympia , next to the ancient ruins there . international help has begun to arrive as greece tries to cope with wildfires raging out of control on the peloponnesian peninsula , with the death toll by latest count reaching 53 , officials said .
a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman looks on the fire approaching houses in evia island " we are optimistic that , if the weather and the reduction in the winds hold long enough , we may be able to be more effective , " fire department spokesman nikos diamandis said , adding that it was impossible to say exactly how large an area had burnt or how many homes had been destroyed .
" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .
homes were burning , electricity had been cut and the fire had reached the olympia museum in front of the shrine to zeus , officials said .
fires have also been reported raging near the port town of kalamata and near sparta on the southeastern part of the peninsula and near corinth in the north .
another fire has been reported on euboea , greece 's second-largest island .
asking for help greece asked for european union assistance on friday , in particular for water-bombing aircraft , and the european commission , through its community mechanism for civil protection , put out urgent calls to the 30 countries that participate in the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villages are being devoured by flames " it 's a critical situation ... much worse than ours , " said italy 's public-safety chief guido bertolaso .
" even though we are still in the middle of an emergency in italy , we can not be deaf to the greek government 's appeal . "
the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .

a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .
irmgard von stephani , a berlin resident who will be 112 on sept .
20 , is the oldest german alive . centenarian boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the mind and body active is key to longevity every year , german president horst köhler sends a personal congratulatory note to every centenarian and starting at 105 , a birthday greeting every year .
in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity .

" even though we are still in the middle of an emergency in italy , we can not be deaf to the greek government 's appeal . "
the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .
the death toll from the greek fires climbed on saturday as search parties of soldiers and firefighters discovered more charred bodies in cars , homes and the countryside .

i am convinced that we need to strengthen our forest firefighting capacity to combat these fires together , " added eu environment and civil protection commissioner stavros dimas .
it marks the fourth appeal by greece to its eu partners since june for help in combating forest fires , which have spread due to several heat waves and months of drought .

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .

in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity .

the cull was ordered after 400 geese were found dead . a team of eight vets and poultry workers at the farm in wachenroth , bavaria , started what officials called the biggest ever culling operation in germany late on saturday .
the birds were placed in three large containers where they were either gassed or electrocuted , officials said after the operation ended on sunday afternoon .
tests by the friedrich loeffler institute of veterinary medicine had found the lethal strain of the virus in five of the birds .
a three-kilometer exclusion zone was set up around the farm , near the city of erlangen which is about 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- north of munich , as officials began tracking down the cause of the infection .
initial reports said the infected animals came from another poultry farm in the northern state of lower saxony , but this was later denied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tests determined that birds at the poultry farm died of the h5n1 strain of bird flu " we have not been able to pinpoint the source of outbreak , " said bavarian health secretary otmar bernhard .
experts are expected to keep trying to determine how the virus entered the farm .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza has killed nearly 200 people in recent years , mainly through direct contact with poultry .
most of the victims have been in asia .
there have been no human deaths from bird flu in europe , where outbreaks were reported recently in several countries , including germany and the czech republic .

the result is that income from membership fees has declined , which in turn has led to their receiving a smaller share of tax revenue . this has prompted the current cdu / spd governing coalition to propose an increase in the amount of financing from taxes . recent media reports that quoted a figure of up to 15 percent unleashed a storm of protest from opposition politicians and constitutional experts . do n't tamper with the constitution ! volker beck of the environmentalist green party advises against " bringing into question the basic principles of the established laws governing political parties in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands off the basic law ! says volker beck hans herbert von arnim , an expert in constitutional law , agreed , saying it would be wrong to use the decline in the number of party members as an argument . " to make the taxpayers pay for this is a reversal of responsibility , " he said . similar comments have come from reiner holznagel of the german taxpayers ' federation . " the taxpayer should not be penalized for the fact that the parties are losing members , " he said . " the parties should come up with other ideas - and above all they need to find ways to cut costs . " cutbacks this is something the cdu and spd have been doing for years .
they 've cut back on staff , holiday pay and salary increases .
but this has not been enough to offset the decline in funds coming in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of money a party gets from the government depends how well it does among voters however , the force of the current criticism has resulted in a flurry of denials from leading members of both parties that they were envisaging an increase of as much as 15 percent . the likely solution is that state funding for political parties will be brought into line with the increase in costs generally . according to current legislation , any increase in state subsidies should be pegged to a price index which the federal statistics office presents to parliament each year . current figures indicate that the parties would be entitled to an increase of 5.9 percent which is around 7.8 million euros . that should go some way towards easing their situation and calm the fears of those who had feared an attack on the constitution . dw staff -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .

in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity .

flames have now reached the village of olympia , next to the ancient ruins there . international help has begun to arrive as greece tries to cope with wildfires raging out of control on the peloponnesian peninsula , with the death toll by latest count reaching 53 , officials said .
a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman looks on the fire approaching houses in evia island " we are optimistic that , if the weather and the reduction in the winds hold long enough , we may be able to be more effective , " fire department spokesman nikos diamandis said , adding that it was impossible to say exactly how large an area had burnt or how many homes had been destroyed .
" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .
homes were burning , electricity had been cut and the fire had reached the olympia museum in front of the shrine to zeus , officials said .
fires have also been reported raging near the port town of kalamata and near sparta on the southeastern part of the peninsula and near corinth in the north .
another fire has been reported on euboea , greece 's second-largest island .
asking for help greece asked for european union assistance on friday , in particular for water-bombing aircraft , and the european commission , through its community mechanism for civil protection , put out urgent calls to the 30 countries that participate in the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villages are being devoured by flames " it 's a critical situation ... much worse than ours , " said italy 's public-safety chief guido bertolaso .
" even though we are still in the middle of an emergency in italy , we can not be deaf to the greek government 's appeal . "
the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .
the death toll from the greek fires climbed on saturday as search parties of soldiers and firefighters discovered more charred bodies in cars , homes and the countryside .
call for unity " i am saddened by the tragic loss of human lives that these forest fires have brought with them and hope that the european partners will live up to expectations and provide all the material support greece needs in this moment of distress , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's prime minister kostas karamanlis says arsonists are responsible for the disaster " i am distressed that europe 's southern shores are once again experiencing climatic conditions that favor the spread of these fires .
i am convinced that we need to strengthen our forest firefighting capacity to combat these fires together , " added eu environment and civil protection commissioner stavros dimas .

flames have now reached the village of olympia , next to the ancient ruins there . international help has begun to arrive as greece tries to cope with wildfires raging out of control on the peloponnesian peninsula , with the death toll by latest count reaching 53 , officials said .
a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .

" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .

the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .
the death toll from the greek fires climbed on saturday as search parties of soldiers and firefighters discovered more charred bodies in cars , homes and the countryside .

flames have now reached the village of olympia , next to the ancient ruins there . international help has begun to arrive as greece tries to cope with wildfires raging out of control on the peloponnesian peninsula , with the death toll by latest count reaching 53 , officials said .
a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman looks on the fire approaching houses in evia island " we are optimistic that , if the weather and the reduction in the winds hold long enough , we may be able to be more effective , " fire department spokesman nikos diamandis said , adding that it was impossible to say exactly how large an area had burnt or how many homes had been destroyed .
" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .
homes were burning , electricity had been cut and the fire had reached the olympia museum in front of the shrine to zeus , officials said .
fires have also been reported raging near the port town of kalamata and near sparta on the southeastern part of the peninsula and near corinth in the north .
another fire has been reported on euboea , greece 's second-largest island .
asking for help greece asked for european union assistance on friday , in particular for water-bombing aircraft , and the european commission , through its community mechanism for civil protection , put out urgent calls to the 30 countries that participate in the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villages are being devoured by flames " it 's a critical situation ... much worse than ours , " said italy 's public-safety chief guido bertolaso .
" even though we are still in the middle of an emergency in italy , we can not be deaf to the greek government 's appeal . "
the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .
the death toll from the greek fires climbed on saturday as search parties of soldiers and firefighters discovered more charred bodies in cars , homes and the countryside .
call for unity " i am saddened by the tragic loss of human lives that these forest fires have brought with them and hope that the european partners will live up to expectations and provide all the material support greece needs in this moment of distress , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's prime minister kostas karamanlis says arsonists are responsible for the disaster " i am distressed that europe 's southern shores are once again experiencing climatic conditions that favor the spread of these fires .
i am convinced that we need to strengthen our forest firefighting capacity to combat these fires together , " added eu environment and civil protection commissioner stavros dimas .
it marks the fourth appeal by greece to its eu partners since june for help in combating forest fires , which have spread due to several heat waves and months of drought .
prime minister kostas karamanlis has blamed arsonists for the latest inferno and police have so far arrested seven people in connection with the blazes . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .

the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .

their internal organization must conform to democratic principles . they must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds . " if parties are to participate effectively in the formation of the political will of the people , some kind of state funding is required . there has long been disagreement over what form this should take and a new debate has arisen after fresh proposals by the parties making up the ruling grand coalition were made . in germany , if you want to join a political party you have to pay a regular membership fee .
however these fees alone are not sufficient for the parties ' needs and they receive additional financing from tax revenues . success ratio the precise amount each party receives depends on the extent to which it is rooted within society . in other words , the size of the tax contribution is calculated on the basis of a party 's electoral success and on how many registered members it has .
at present , germany 's political parties receive some 133 million euros -lrb- $ 181 million -rrb- from tax revenues . but calls for this to be increased are growing louder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties are n't cheap to run for some time now germany 's two largest parties , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been losing members .
the result is that income from membership fees has declined , which in turn has led to their receiving a smaller share of tax revenue . this has prompted the current cdu / spd governing coalition to propose an increase in the amount of financing from taxes . recent media reports that quoted a figure of up to 15 percent unleashed a storm of protest from opposition politicians and constitutional experts . do n't tamper with the constitution ! volker beck of the environmentalist green party advises against " bringing into question the basic principles of the established laws governing political parties in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands off the basic law ! says volker beck hans herbert von arnim , an expert in constitutional law , agreed , saying it would be wrong to use the decline in the number of party members as an argument . " to make the taxpayers pay for this is a reversal of responsibility , " he said . similar comments have come from reiner holznagel of the german taxpayers ' federation . " the taxpayer should not be penalized for the fact that the parties are losing members , " he said . " the parties should come up with other ideas - and above all they need to find ways to cut costs . " cutbacks this is something the cdu and spd have been doing for years .
they 've cut back on staff , holiday pay and salary increases .
but this has not been enough to offset the decline in funds coming in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of money a party gets from the government depends how well it does among voters however , the force of the current criticism has resulted in a flurry of denials from leading members of both parties that they were envisaging an increase of as much as 15 percent . the likely solution is that state funding for political parties will be brought into line with the increase in costs generally . according to current legislation , any increase in state subsidies should be pegged to a price index which the federal statistics office presents to parliament each year . current figures indicate that the parties would be entitled to an increase of 5.9 percent which is around 7.8 million euros . that should go some way towards easing their situation and calm the fears of those who had feared an attack on the constitution . dw staff -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

flames have now reached the village of olympia , next to the ancient ruins there . international help has begun to arrive as greece tries to cope with wildfires raging out of control on the peloponnesian peninsula , with the death toll by latest count reaching 53 , officials said .
a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman looks on the fire approaching houses in evia island " we are optimistic that , if the weather and the reduction in the winds hold long enough , we may be able to be more effective , " fire department spokesman nikos diamandis said , adding that it was impossible to say exactly how large an area had burnt or how many homes had been destroyed .
" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .
homes were burning , electricity had been cut and the fire had reached the olympia museum in front of the shrine to zeus , officials said .
fires have also been reported raging near the port town of kalamata and near sparta on the southeastern part of the peninsula and near corinth in the north .
another fire has been reported on euboea , greece 's second-largest island .
asking for help greece asked for european union assistance on friday , in particular for water-bombing aircraft , and the european commission , through its community mechanism for civil protection , put out urgent calls to the 30 countries that participate in the program .

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .
irmgard von stephani , a berlin resident who will be 112 on sept .

in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .
maria milz told dpa that when she reached 100 , she decided to leave the nursing home where she was living because " there were too many old people there . " many seniors keep fit with sporting activities .
wolfgang lob , 81 , told dpa he took part in a half-marathon in preparation for the full 42- kilometer -lrb- 26-mile -rrb- run in cologne , which will take place on oct.7. gerontologists say being physically and mentally active is the key to remaining healthy in later years . auguste bremer , although suffering from hearing and vision problems , provided an insight into her longevity .

flames have now reached the village of olympia , next to the ancient ruins there . international help has begun to arrive as greece tries to cope with wildfires raging out of control on the peloponnesian peninsula , with the death toll by latest count reaching 53 , officials said .
a spokesman for the greek fire department , nikos diamantis , said france had sent four firefighting planes and italy two , while france and cyprus had each sent 60 firefighters to the affected region .
on monday , greece was expecting four firefighting planes from serbia and two from spain , while two helicopters each were to arrive from germany and the netherlands .
israel , romania , norway and slovenia were each sending one helicopter , while switzerland and iceland have also offered assistance .
slight reprieve the fire department has said efforts to contain the fires are being helped by a drop in the heavy winds that have swept the fires though thousands of hectares of forest and scrub since friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman looks on the fire approaching houses in evia island " we are optimistic that , if the weather and the reduction in the winds hold long enough , we may be able to be more effective , " fire department spokesman nikos diamandis said , adding that it was impossible to say exactly how large an area had burnt or how many homes had been destroyed .
" fires are burning in more than half the country , " he said .
on sunday , flames reached the village of olympia , adjacent to the archeological site of ancient olympia , birthplace of the olympic games .
homes were burning , electricity had been cut and the fire had reached the olympia museum in front of the shrine to zeus , officials said .
fires have also been reported raging near the port town of kalamata and near sparta on the southeastern part of the peninsula and near corinth in the north .
another fire has been reported on euboea , greece 's second-largest island .
asking for help greece asked for european union assistance on friday , in particular for water-bombing aircraft , and the european commission , through its community mechanism for civil protection , put out urgent calls to the 30 countries that participate in the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villages are being devoured by flames " it 's a critical situation ... much worse than ours , " said italy 's public-safety chief guido bertolaso .
" even though we are still in the middle of an emergency in italy , we can not be deaf to the greek government 's appeal . "
the peloponnese faces " a truly catastrophic situation , with a death toll that is continuing to rise incredibly , " he said as italian firefighters continued to battle blazes , notably in sicily and the naples region .
the death toll from the greek fires climbed on saturday as search parties of soldiers and firefighters discovered more charred bodies in cars , homes and the countryside .
call for unity " i am saddened by the tragic loss of human lives that these forest fires have brought with them and hope that the european partners will live up to expectations and provide all the material support greece needs in this moment of distress , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's prime minister kostas karamanlis says arsonists are responsible for the disaster " i am distressed that europe 's southern shores are once again experiencing climatic conditions that favor the spread of these fires .
i am convinced that we need to strengthen our forest firefighting capacity to combat these fires together , " added eu environment and civil protection commissioner stavros dimas .
it marks the fourth appeal by greece to its eu partners since june for help in combating forest fires , which have spread due to several heat waves and months of drought .
prime minister kostas karamanlis has blamed arsonists for the latest inferno and police have so far arrested seven people in connection with the blazes . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their internal organization must conform to democratic principles . they must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds . " if parties are to participate effectively in the formation of the political will of the people , some kind of state funding is required . there has long been disagreement over what form this should take and a new debate has arisen after fresh proposals by the parties making up the ruling grand coalition were made . in germany , if you want to join a political party you have to pay a regular membership fee .
however these fees alone are not sufficient for the parties ' needs and they receive additional financing from tax revenues . success ratio the precise amount each party receives depends on the extent to which it is rooted within society . in other words , the size of the tax contribution is calculated on the basis of a party 's electoral success and on how many registered members it has .
at present , germany 's political parties receive some 133 million euros -lrb- $ 181 million -rrb- from tax revenues . but calls for this to be increased are growing louder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties are n't cheap to run for some time now germany 's two largest parties , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been losing members .
the result is that income from membership fees has declined , which in turn has led to their receiving a smaller share of tax revenue . this has prompted the current cdu / spd governing coalition to propose an increase in the amount of financing from taxes . recent media reports that quoted a figure of up to 15 percent unleashed a storm of protest from opposition politicians and constitutional experts . do n't tamper with the constitution ! volker beck of the environmentalist green party advises against " bringing into question the basic principles of the established laws governing political parties in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands off the basic law ! says volker beck hans herbert von arnim , an expert in constitutional law , agreed , saying it would be wrong to use the decline in the number of party members as an argument . " to make the taxpayers pay for this is a reversal of responsibility , " he said . similar comments have come from reiner holznagel of the german taxpayers ' federation . " the taxpayer should not be penalized for the fact that the parties are losing members , " he said . " the parties should come up with other ideas - and above all they need to find ways to cut costs . " cutbacks this is something the cdu and spd have been doing for years .
they 've cut back on staff , holiday pay and salary increases .
but this has not been enough to offset the decline in funds coming in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of money a party gets from the government depends how well it does among voters however , the force of the current criticism has resulted in a flurry of denials from leading members of both parties that they were envisaging an increase of as much as 15 percent . the likely solution is that state funding for political parties will be brought into line with the increase in costs generally . according to current legislation , any increase in state subsidies should be pegged to a price index which the federal statistics office presents to parliament each year . current figures indicate that the parties would be entitled to an increase of 5.9 percent which is around 7.8 million euros . that should go some way towards easing their situation and calm the fears of those who had feared an attack on the constitution . dw staff -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their internal organization must conform to democratic principles . they must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds . " if parties are to participate effectively in the formation of the political will of the people , some kind of state funding is required . there has long been disagreement over what form this should take and a new debate has arisen after fresh proposals by the parties making up the ruling grand coalition were made . in germany , if you want to join a political party you have to pay a regular membership fee .
however these fees alone are not sufficient for the parties ' needs and they receive additional financing from tax revenues . success ratio the precise amount each party receives depends on the extent to which it is rooted within society . in other words , the size of the tax contribution is calculated on the basis of a party 's electoral success and on how many registered members it has .
at present , germany 's political parties receive some 133 million euros -lrb- $ 181 million -rrb- from tax revenues . but calls for this to be increased are growing louder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties are n't cheap to run for some time now germany 's two largest parties , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been losing members .
the result is that income from membership fees has declined , which in turn has led to their receiving a smaller share of tax revenue . this has prompted the current cdu / spd governing coalition to propose an increase in the amount of financing from taxes . recent media reports that quoted a figure of up to 15 percent unleashed a storm of protest from opposition politicians and constitutional experts . do n't tamper with the constitution ! volker beck of the environmentalist green party advises against " bringing into question the basic principles of the established laws governing political parties in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands off the basic law ! says volker beck hans herbert von arnim , an expert in constitutional law , agreed , saying it would be wrong to use the decline in the number of party members as an argument . " to make the taxpayers pay for this is a reversal of responsibility , " he said . similar comments have come from reiner holznagel of the german taxpayers ' federation . " the taxpayer should not be penalized for the fact that the parties are losing members , " he said . " the parties should come up with other ideas - and above all they need to find ways to cut costs . " cutbacks this is something the cdu and spd have been doing for years .
they 've cut back on staff , holiday pay and salary increases .
but this has not been enough to offset the decline in funds coming in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of money a party gets from the government depends how well it does among voters however , the force of the current criticism has resulted in a flurry of denials from leading members of both parties that they were envisaging an increase of as much as 15 percent . the likely solution is that state funding for political parties will be brought into line with the increase in costs generally . according to current legislation , any increase in state subsidies should be pegged to a price index which the federal statistics office presents to parliament each year . current figures indicate that the parties would be entitled to an increase of 5.9 percent which is around 7.8 million euros . that should go some way towards easing their situation and calm the fears of those who had feared an attack on the constitution . dw staff -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their internal organization must conform to democratic principles . they must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds .

their internal organization must conform to democratic principles . they must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds . " if parties are to participate effectively in the formation of the political will of the people , some kind of state funding is required . there has long been disagreement over what form this should take and a new debate has arisen after fresh proposals by the parties making up the ruling grand coalition were made . in germany , if you want to join a political party you have to pay a regular membership fee .
however these fees alone are not sufficient for the parties ' needs and they receive additional financing from tax revenues . success ratio the precise amount each party receives depends on the extent to which it is rooted within society . in other words , the size of the tax contribution is calculated on the basis of a party 's electoral success and on how many registered members it has .
at present , germany 's political parties receive some 133 million euros -lrb- $ 181 million -rrb- from tax revenues . but calls for this to be increased are growing louder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties are n't cheap to run for some time now germany 's two largest parties , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been losing members .
the result is that income from membership fees has declined , which in turn has led to their receiving a smaller share of tax revenue . this has prompted the current cdu / spd governing coalition to propose an increase in the amount of financing from taxes . recent media reports that quoted a figure of up to 15 percent unleashed a storm of protest from opposition politicians and constitutional experts . do n't tamper with the constitution ! volker beck of the environmentalist green party advises against " bringing into question the basic principles of the established laws governing political parties in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands off the basic law ! says volker beck hans herbert von arnim , an expert in constitutional law , agreed , saying it would be wrong to use the decline in the number of party members as an argument . " to make the taxpayers pay for this is a reversal of responsibility , " he said . similar comments have come from reiner holznagel of the german taxpayers ' federation . " the taxpayer should not be penalized for the fact that the parties are losing members , " he said . " the parties should come up with other ideas - and above all they need to find ways to cut costs . " cutbacks this is something the cdu and spd have been doing for years .
they 've cut back on staff , holiday pay and salary increases .
but this has not been enough to offset the decline in funds coming in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of money a party gets from the government depends how well it does among voters however , the force of the current criticism has resulted in a flurry of denials from leading members of both parties that they were envisaging an increase of as much as 15 percent . the likely solution is that state funding for political parties will be brought into line with the increase in costs generally . according to current legislation , any increase in state subsidies should be pegged to a price index which the federal statistics office presents to parliament each year . current figures indicate that the parties would be entitled to an increase of 5.9 percent which is around 7.8 million euros . that should go some way towards easing their situation and calm the fears of those who had feared an attack on the constitution . dw staff -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't feel like a 103-year-old - i 'm feeling great , " bremer , who lives in a nursing home for the elderly in cologne , said in an interview with the german news agency dpa . the number of seniors reaching the milestone of 100 has been rising steadily . out of a population of over 82 million in germany today , the number of seniors who are 80 or older has nearly doubled since 1980 to four million , according to the latest statistics . headlines such as " eldest resident in bonn celebrates her 108th birthday " or " all the best for your 102nd birthday " are becoming more commonplace .
irmgard von stephani , a berlin resident who will be 112 on sept .
20 , is the oldest german alive . centenarian boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the mind and body active is key to longevity every year , german president horst köhler sends a personal congratulatory note to every centenarian and starting at 105 , a birthday greeting every year .
in 2003 , köhler had sent 4,210 missives ; last year he sent 5,217 . germans are not only living longer lives , but healthier ones too , meaning the need for a societal infrastructure that accommodates the needs of an aging population . besides suitable housing for the elderly , public institutions need to provide ramps for wheelchairs and stores need to carry products for the aged , such as walking canes or orthopedic shoes , according to ursula lenz , a spokeswoman of a federal agency for the elderly -lrb- bagso -rrb- in bonn , who also spoke to dpa . meeting the needs of the elderly the vast majority of those 80 or over live in private households , either with their families or on their own with household help .
of those 11 percent living in nursing homes , most tend to require round-the-clock care . common health problems afflicting the elderly include dementia as well as heart and circulation disorders , diabetes , strokes and a vulnerability to developing tumors - both benign and malignant .
many of these chronic illnesses can be controlled with preventive medicine . germany 's health care system is inadequately prepared to cope with the growing numbers of health problems that affect seniors , according to experts in the field of geriatrics . alternatives to the nursing home most seniors prefer to live at home rather that in an institution , and there are alternatives to the classic nursing home , such as multi-family housing where several generations live in separate apartments , but under one roof , according to lenz . another trend which has been growing in the united states is the concept of " independent living " in which seniors who are still relatively healthy live in a community where meals are provided and shops , banks , transportation and medical services are easily accessible . product testers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-family housing permits several generations to live under one roof businesses often take the lead in providing services and products that are geared to the elderly , but suitable for the general population as well .
seniors are often subjects in marketing surveys that determine whether products are user friendly , such if mobile phone buttons are too small for less-nimble fingers or whether the print is too fine in instruction manuals for aging eyes . ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister , wants the government to invest in a program called " business engine for the elderly , " which advises companies on products and services suited to an aging population . keeping active and happy key to longevity centenarians who are energetic and healthy enough prefer to live on their own .

the home office says people could pass on information to a third party and retain their anonymity .
home secretary jacqui smith is also considering setting up a network of " drop-off zones " where guns can be handed in anonymously .
it comes amid a major police investigation into the fatal shooting of rhys jones , 11 , on wednesday .
police in liverpool said they had been disappointed by the public response to an appeal for locals to identify the killer .
a home office spokesman said trials would run in areas where gun crime was worst .
the government is in talks with the police about exactly where and when these would take place .
about half of all gun crime takes place in the cities of liverpool , manchester and london , he said .
the scheme would not be an amnesty for illegal weapons , rather an attempt to get them off the streets , the home office said .
in an interview in sunday 's news of the world , ms smith said people who knew where firearms were hidden or were holding them for a relative or friend needed to be able to come forward without revealing their identity . "
mums or sisters or brothers may know there is someone in their family who has got a gun " jacqui smith home secretary " sometimes people directly ask friends or other members of their family to look after their guns for them , " she said .
" mums or sisters or brothers may know there is someone in their family who has got a gun .
" they know it 's wrong and they want to find a way to get that gun off their family member and make sure they are not able to use it and get themselves into the trouble they are obviously going to get themselves into . "
ms smith said people needed to be able to go somewhere to hand in weapons or pass on information anonymously , without necessarily contacting the police directly .
" the most suitable place may not be a local police station , it may be a voluntary organisation that can work with the police and others where family members can go to and feel confident they can get that gun off the streets or out of their family home , " she said .
" this means we can actually take that gun out of circulation and stop it from doing harm . "
but the us civil rights activist the reverend jesse jackson told bbc radio 4 's sunday programme that the government must stop guns from reaching britain 's streets .
" the source must be addressed , " he said .
" mr straw -lrb- justice minister jack straw -rrb- suggests they may be coming in from eastern europe .
wherever they 're coming from , stop the gun flow and make the gun manufacturers accountable .
and those who use them accountable . "
the home office stressed there would be no amnesty for people who possessed illegal firearms and police would always need to investigate any weapon in relation to crimes committed .
" we want to work with the police to create a scheme whereby members of the public can tip off a third party if they know someone is in possession of a gun or , if they find a gun , hand it in to that third party themselves , " a spokesman said .
" the third party would then liaise with the police , protecting the anonymity of the informer . "
anyone wishing to inform on people anonymously can already do so via crimestoppers .

the government is in talks with the police about exactly where and when these would take place .
about half of all gun crime takes place in the cities of liverpool , manchester and london , he said .
the scheme would not be an amnesty for illegal weapons , rather an attempt to get them off the streets , the home office said .

the home office says people could pass on information to a third party and retain their anonymity .
home secretary jacqui smith is also considering setting up a network of " drop-off zones " where guns can be handed in anonymously .
it comes amid a major police investigation into the fatal shooting of rhys jones , 11 , on wednesday .
police in liverpool said they had been disappointed by the public response to an appeal for locals to identify the killer .
see where teenagers were killed across england a home office spokesman said trials would run in areas where gun crime was worst .
the government is in talks with the police about exactly where and when these would take place .
about half of all gun crime takes place in the cities of liverpool , manchester and london , he said .
the scheme would not be an amnesty for illegal weapons , rather an attempt to get them off the streets , the home office said .
in an interview in sunday 's news of the world , ms smith said people who knew where firearms were hidden or were holding them for a relative or friend needed to be able to come forward without revealing their identity .

" mums or sisters or brothers may know there is someone in their family who has got a gun .
" they know it 's wrong and they want to find a way to get that gun off their family member and make sure they are not able to use it and get themselves into the trouble they are obviously going to get themselves into . "
ms smith said people needed to be able to go somewhere to hand in weapons or pass on information anonymously , without necessarily contacting the police directly .
11-year-old rhys jones was shot dead in liverpool " the most suitable place may not be a local police station , it may be a voluntary organisation that can work with the police and others where family members can go to and feel confident they can get that gun off the streets or out of their family home , " she said .
" this means we can actually take that gun out of circulation and stop it from doing harm . "
but the us civil rights activist the reverend jesse jackson told bbc radio 4 's sunday programme that the government must stop guns from reaching britain 's streets .

wherever they 're coming from , stop the gun flow and make the gun manufacturers accountable .
and those who use them accountable . "
the home office stressed there would be no amnesty for people who possessed illegal firearms and police would always need to investigate any weapon in relation to crimes committed .
" we want to work with the police to create a scheme whereby members of the public can tip off a third party if they know someone is in possession of a gun or , if they find a gun , hand it in to that third party themselves , " a spokesman said .
" the third party would then liaise with the police , protecting the anonymity of the informer . "
