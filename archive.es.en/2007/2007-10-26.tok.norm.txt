for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .
in iraq , this realization came too late .
in afghanistan , there 's still time for nato to act .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .

the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "
meanwhile , human rights groups , including amnesty international , urged eu leaders to confront putin at the summit on what many see as the kremlin 's dubious human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .
business confidence continues to drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are expected to slow while economists also expect an economic slowdown , the government predicted that the german economy will continue doing well for the rest of the year .
the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .
" the results indicate that the upswing will continue but at a slower pace , " an ifo statement quoted president hans-werner sinn as saying .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .

the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .

on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .

" the international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , the french league for human rights -lrb- ldh -rrb- , the us center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and germany 's european center for constitutional and human rights -lrb- ecchr -rrb- filed the joint suit before a paris prosecutor on thursday . in a statement posted on the fidh website , the groups say that during his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses in us-run detention centers at abu ghraib in iraq and guantanamo bay in cuba , as well as elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld was the us defense secretary from 2001 to 2006 the rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by rumsfeld between october 2002 and april 2003 " legitimizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs . the group also has testimony from janis karpinski - the one-time commander of us military prisons in iraq - to bolster its claims . images rocked the world the abu ghraib jail in iraq made headlines in april 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers were leaked to the media . former prisoners at guantanamo bay are suing rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse and humiliation at abu ghraib was captured in 100s of photos the us denies any torture has taken place in its detention centers and has defended its interrogation techniques . rumsfeld in paris the plaintiffs argue in their filing that french courts have universal jurisdiction - allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad - under the 1984 convention against torture , which was been ratified by both the united states and france . the group says rumsfeld , who is in paris for a talk sponsored by foreign policy magazine , should be arrested while he was in france . " we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .
an appeal will be filed against this decision next week . three other cases have been filed against rumsfeld in argentina , spain and sweden . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .
the spd has a lot of ground to make up if it wants to re-take the chancellery in the 2009 elections .
reforms to be partly rolled back the spd is also wrangling over its future course ever since beck this month said the government should reverse cuts in jobless benefits for elderly unemployed people introduced schröder 's agenda 2010 package of sweeping labor and social reforms which sparked major nation-wide demonstrations .
economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .
schröder , who spoke at the spd conference , said he was not worried about the decision to scale back his agenda 2010 reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .
" the ' agenda 2010 ' is an instrument and not the final goal .
it can be adjusted . "
schröder , who ruled from 1998 to 2005 , urged the party to remind voters of what the spd has accomplished in the past decade in areas such as energy , climate , immigration and social policies .
" the conservatives fought us for that and now they 're copying us , " he said .
" you 're the original .
they 're the fakes . "
cdu general secretary ronald pofalla accused beck of pushing the spd to the left .

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .
" we already have two european organizations that look at human rights , " said nils muiznieks , a former integration minister and expert on eu-russia relations at the latvian university .
" russia is trying to destroy both of them .
why do we need a third ? "
few agreements reached at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another cuban missile crisis ?
on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .
they also established a body to promote cultural exchanges .
putin confirmed that russia would invite osce observers to its forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .
but the key issues which experts had highlighted before the summit remained unsolved .
neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .
the eu 's plans to ban any company from its energy markets which both produces and distributes energy had also drawn russian fire before the meeting .
russian officials say that the measure is aimed at keeping russian gas monopolist gazprom out of europe .
putin likens tensions to cuban missile crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit a step towards normalizing relations while the portuguese summit seemed to restore normalcy to the eu-russia relationship , the same can not be said for the ongoing tension between russia and the united states .
the issue of plans to install a missile-defense system in eu members poland and the czech republic surfaced friday when putin compared the situation to the 1962 cuban missile crisis .
at the same time , putin suggested the tension was much lower than during the cuban missile crisis because he feels the us is listening to moscow 's concerns about the missile plans .
" on a positive note , i note that concerns about threats to our security are being heard by the americans , " putin said .

with more than six billion people , earth 's population is now so big that " the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available , " the report warned , adding that the global population is expected to peak at between 8 and 9.7 billion by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans are using too many of the planet 's resources each person needs 22 hectares of the earth 's surface to supply their needs , but the earth 's biological capacity is only 16 per person , the un report calculated . endangered ecosystems according to the report , which was released on thursday evening in new york , the condition of the land , sea , air and rivers have all deteriorated in the past 20 years . fishing capacity is nearly four times more than is sustainable and species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than fossil records show - over 30 percent of amphibians , 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to safe water is already a problem for millions of people in two decades time , drinking water will become scarce , affecting some 1.8 million people .
more than three million people are already dying today from the effects of polluted water . failure to act the report , which was compiled by 390 experts and peer reviewed by 1,000 others , was critical of the lack of action by governments across the world . it describes as " woefully inadequate " the global response to problems such as cutting emissions of carbon gases from power and transport that scientists say will boost average temperatures by up to four degrees celsius this century .
speaking at the report 's release , unep executive director achim steiner said that the " systematic destruction of the earth 's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged . " he warned , the " bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay . " some positives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner from the unep was critical of government responses on a note of encouragement , steiner said the global response in the two decades since has in some cases been " courageous and inspiring " . " over the past 20 years , the international community has cut , by 95 percent , the production of ozone-layer damaging chemicals , " steiner said .
there has also been the creation of " a greenhouse-gas emission reduction treaty along with innovative carbon trading and carbon offset markets , " he added . but unfortunately , these cases were the exception rather than the rule . " all too often -lrb- the response -rrb- has been slow and at a pace and scale that fails to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet , " steiner said . according to the report , the fourth in a series , the earth has experienced five mass extinctions in 450 million years , the latest of which occurred 65 million years ago .

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .

with more than six billion people , earth 's population is now so big that " the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available , " the report warned , adding that the global population is expected to peak at between 8 and 9.7 billion by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans are using too many of the planet 's resources each person needs 22 hectares of the earth 's surface to supply their needs , but the earth 's biological capacity is only 16 per person , the un report calculated . endangered ecosystems according to the report , which was released on thursday evening in new york , the condition of the land , sea , air and rivers have all deteriorated in the past 20 years . fishing capacity is nearly four times more than is sustainable and species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than fossil records show - over 30 percent of amphibians , 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to safe water is already a problem for millions of people in two decades time , drinking water will become scarce , affecting some 1.8 million people .
more than three million people are already dying today from the effects of polluted water . failure to act the report , which was compiled by 390 experts and peer reviewed by 1,000 others , was critical of the lack of action by governments across the world . it describes as " woefully inadequate " the global response to problems such as cutting emissions of carbon gases from power and transport that scientists say will boost average temperatures by up to four degrees celsius this century .
speaking at the report 's release , unep executive director achim steiner said that the " systematic destruction of the earth 's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged . " he warned , the " bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay . " some positives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner from the unep was critical of government responses on a note of encouragement , steiner said the global response in the two decades since has in some cases been " courageous and inspiring " . " over the past 20 years , the international community has cut , by 95 percent , the production of ozone-layer damaging chemicals , " steiner said .
there has also been the creation of " a greenhouse-gas emission reduction treaty along with innovative carbon trading and carbon offset markets , " he added . but unfortunately , these cases were the exception rather than the rule . " all too often -lrb- the response -rrb- has been slow and at a pace and scale that fails to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet , " steiner said . according to the report , the fourth in a series , the earth has experienced five mass extinctions in 450 million years , the latest of which occurred 65 million years ago . " a sixth major extinction is under way , this time caused by human behaviour , " it said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .

both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .

subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .

" the international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , the french league for human rights -lrb- ldh -rrb- , the us center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and germany 's european center for constitutional and human rights -lrb- ecchr -rrb- filed the joint suit before a paris prosecutor on thursday . in a statement posted on the fidh website , the groups say that during his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses in us-run detention centers at abu ghraib in iraq and guantanamo bay in cuba , as well as elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld was the us defense secretary from 2001 to 2006 the rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by rumsfeld between october 2002 and april 2003 " legitimizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs . the group also has testimony from janis karpinski - the one-time commander of us military prisons in iraq - to bolster its claims . images rocked the world the abu ghraib jail in iraq made headlines in april 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers were leaked to the media . former prisoners at guantanamo bay are suing rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse and humiliation at abu ghraib was captured in 100s of photos the us denies any torture has taken place in its detention centers and has defended its interrogation techniques . rumsfeld in paris the plaintiffs argue in their filing that french courts have universal jurisdiction - allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad - under the 1984 convention against torture , which was been ratified by both the united states and france . the group says rumsfeld , who is in paris for a talk sponsored by foreign policy magazine , should be arrested while he was in france . " we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "
meanwhile , human rights groups , including amnesty international , urged eu leaders to confront putin at the summit on what many see as the kremlin 's dubious human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with more than six billion people , earth 's population is now so big that " the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available , " the report warned , adding that the global population is expected to peak at between 8 and 9.7 billion by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans are using too many of the planet 's resources each person needs 22 hectares of the earth 's surface to supply their needs , but the earth 's biological capacity is only 16 per person , the un report calculated . endangered ecosystems according to the report , which was released on thursday evening in new york , the condition of the land , sea , air and rivers have all deteriorated in the past 20 years . fishing capacity is nearly four times more than is sustainable and species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than fossil records show - over 30 percent of amphibians , 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to safe water is already a problem for millions of people in two decades time , drinking water will become scarce , affecting some 1.8 million people .

a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.10.2007 germany 's social democrats hint at shift to the left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader kurt beck is leading the swerve to the left in an effort to pull itself out of a poll slump , germany 's social democrats have signalled they 'll scale back a key reform passed by former chancellor schröder in order to win back the party 's disillusioned base . germany 's embattled center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began a three-day party congress in the northern city of hamburg on friday , oct .
26 to seek ways to shore up flagging support and resolve a bitter row over painful labor market reforms passed by former chancellor gerhard schröder .
spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .
the spd has a lot of ground to make up if it wants to re-take the chancellery in the 2009 elections .
reforms to be partly rolled back the spd is also wrangling over its future course ever since beck this month said the government should reverse cuts in jobless benefits for elderly unemployed people introduced schröder 's agenda 2010 package of sweeping labor and social reforms which sparked major nation-wide demonstrations .
economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .
schröder , who spoke at the spd conference , said he was not worried about the decision to scale back his agenda 2010 reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .
" the ' agenda 2010 ' is an instrument and not the final goal .
it can be adjusted . "
schröder , who ruled from 1998 to 2005 , urged the party to remind voters of what the spd has accomplished in the past decade in areas such as energy , climate , immigration and social policies .
" the conservatives fought us for that and now they 're copying us , " he said .
" you 're the original .
they 're the fakes . "
cdu general secretary ronald pofalla accused beck of pushing the spd to the left .
" he 's taking the party backwards instead of looking forward , " pofalla said .
beck insisted friday he was not moving the spd sharply leftwards , but only wanted a " careful readjustment " of the market reforms .
beck said he wants to correct the reforms " at a number of points , but without going backwards . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "

beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .

despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .

with more than six billion people , earth 's population is now so big that " the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available , " the report warned , adding that the global population is expected to peak at between 8 and 9.7 billion by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans are using too many of the planet 's resources each person needs 22 hectares of the earth 's surface to supply their needs , but the earth 's biological capacity is only 16 per person , the un report calculated . endangered ecosystems according to the report , which was released on thursday evening in new york , the condition of the land , sea , air and rivers have all deteriorated in the past 20 years . fishing capacity is nearly four times more than is sustainable and species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than fossil records show - over 30 percent of amphibians , 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to safe water is already a problem for millions of people in two decades time , drinking water will become scarce , affecting some 1.8 million people .
more than three million people are already dying today from the effects of polluted water . failure to act the report , which was compiled by 390 experts and peer reviewed by 1,000 others , was critical of the lack of action by governments across the world . it describes as " woefully inadequate " the global response to problems such as cutting emissions of carbon gases from power and transport that scientists say will boost average temperatures by up to four degrees celsius this century .
speaking at the report 's release , unep executive director achim steiner said that the " systematic destruction of the earth 's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged . " he warned , the " bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay . " some positives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner from the unep was critical of government responses on a note of encouragement , steiner said the global response in the two decades since has in some cases been " courageous and inspiring " . " over the past 20 years , the international community has cut , by 95 percent , the production of ozone-layer damaging chemicals , " steiner said .
there has also been the creation of " a greenhouse-gas emission reduction treaty along with innovative carbon trading and carbon offset markets , " he added . but unfortunately , these cases were the exception rather than the rule . " all too often -lrb- the response -rrb- has been slow and at a pace and scale that fails to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet , " steiner said . according to the report , the fourth in a series , the earth has experienced five mass extinctions in 450 million years , the latest of which occurred 65 million years ago .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good .

putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good .

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .
business confidence continues to drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are expected to slow while economists also expect an economic slowdown , the government predicted that the german economy will continue doing well for the rest of the year .
the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .
" the results indicate that the upswing will continue but at a slower pace , " an ifo statement quoted president hans-werner sinn as saying .
consumer spending could provide boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher employment levels could help keep growth on track the ifo survey showed that of the 7,000 companies asked about their expectations for the next six months , manufacturers were worried , but other sectors seemed positive about their outlook .
the retail sector was particularly positive .
this suggests that " german consumers might have started to open their wallets amid a continuing improvement in employment and slightly more generous pay deals , " bank of american analyst gilles moec told the afp news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .
business confidence continues to drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are expected to slow while economists also expect an economic slowdown , the government predicted that the german economy will continue doing well for the rest of the year .
the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .
" the results indicate that the upswing will continue but at a slower pace , " an ifo statement quoted president hans-werner sinn as saying .
consumer spending could provide boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher employment levels could help keep growth on track the ifo survey showed that of the 7,000 companies asked about their expectations for the next six months , manufacturers were worried , but other sectors seemed positive about their outlook .
the retail sector was particularly positive .
this suggests that " german consumers might have started to open their wallets amid a continuing improvement in employment and slightly more generous pay deals , " bank of american analyst gilles moec told the afp news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .

the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .

the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .

the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .

the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .

26 to seek ways to shore up flagging support and resolve a bitter row over painful labor market reforms passed by former chancellor gerhard schröder .
spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .
the spd has a lot of ground to make up if it wants to re-take the chancellery in the 2009 elections .
reforms to be partly rolled back the spd is also wrangling over its future course ever since beck this month said the government should reverse cuts in jobless benefits for elderly unemployed people introduced schröder 's agenda 2010 package of sweeping labor and social reforms which sparked major nation-wide demonstrations .
economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .
schröder , who spoke at the spd conference , said he was not worried about the decision to scale back his agenda 2010 reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .
" the ' agenda 2010 ' is an instrument and not the final goal .
it can be adjusted . "
schröder , who ruled from 1998 to 2005 , urged the party to remind voters of what the spd has accomplished in the past decade in areas such as energy , climate , immigration and social policies .
" the conservatives fought us for that and now they 're copying us , " he said .
" you 're the original .
they 're the fakes . "
cdu general secretary ronald pofalla accused beck of pushing the spd to the left .
" he 's taking the party backwards instead of looking forward , " pofalla said .
beck insisted friday he was not moving the spd sharply leftwards , but only wanted a " careful readjustment " of the market reforms .
beck said he wants to correct the reforms " at a number of points , but without going backwards . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .

subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .

germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .
in iraq , this realization came too late .
in afghanistan , there 's still time for nato to act .

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .

" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .

but the key issues which experts had highlighted before the summit remained unsolved .
neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .

neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .
the eu 's plans to ban any company from its energy markets which both produces and distributes energy had also drawn russian fire before the meeting .
russian officials say that the measure is aimed at keeping russian gas monopolist gazprom out of europe .

the issue of plans to install a missile-defense system in eu members poland and the czech republic surfaced friday when putin compared the situation to the 1962 cuban missile crisis .
at the same time , putin suggested the tension was much lower than during the cuban missile crisis because he feels the us is listening to moscow 's concerns about the missile plans .
" on a positive note , i note that concerns about threats to our security are being heard by the americans , " putin said .

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .
" we already have two european organizations that look at human rights , " said nils muiznieks , a former integration minister and expert on eu-russia relations at the latvian university .
" russia is trying to destroy both of them .
why do we need a third ? "
few agreements reached at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another cuban missile crisis ?
on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .
they also established a body to promote cultural exchanges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.10.2007 opinion : time to shift focus in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the us urged nato allies to help share the burden of the fighting in afghanistan at a meeting of defense ministers in noordwijk this week , dw 's christoph hasselbach says there 's still time to make the mission work . in europe , many nato member countries are getting fed up with demands , primarily from washington , for greater military involvement in afghanistan - demands that have persisted ever since the launch of the nato mission .
for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .
in iraq , this realization came too late .
in afghanistan , there 's still time for nato to act .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .

putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .
business confidence continues to drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are expected to slow while economists also expect an economic slowdown , the government predicted that the german economy will continue doing well for the rest of the year .
the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .
business confidence continues to drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are expected to slow while economists also expect an economic slowdown , the government predicted that the german economy will continue doing well for the rest of the year .
the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .
" the results indicate that the upswing will continue but at a slower pace , " an ifo statement quoted president hans-werner sinn as saying .
consumer spending could provide boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher employment levels could help keep growth on track the ifo survey showed that of the 7,000 companies asked about their expectations for the next six months , manufacturers were worried , but other sectors seemed positive about their outlook .
the retail sector was particularly positive .
this suggests that " german consumers might have started to open their wallets amid a continuing improvement in employment and slightly more generous pay deals , " bank of american analyst gilles moec told the afp news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.10.2007 germany 's social democrats hint at shift to the left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader kurt beck is leading the swerve to the left in an effort to pull itself out of a poll slump , germany 's social democrats have signalled they 'll scale back a key reform passed by former chancellor schröder in order to win back the party 's disillusioned base . germany 's embattled center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began a three-day party congress in the northern city of hamburg on friday , oct .
26 to seek ways to shore up flagging support and resolve a bitter row over painful labor market reforms passed by former chancellor gerhard schröder .
spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .
the spd has a lot of ground to make up if it wants to re-take the chancellery in the 2009 elections .
reforms to be partly rolled back the spd is also wrangling over its future course ever since beck this month said the government should reverse cuts in jobless benefits for elderly unemployed people introduced schröder 's agenda 2010 package of sweeping labor and social reforms which sparked major nation-wide demonstrations .
economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .
schröder , who spoke at the spd conference , said he was not worried about the decision to scale back his agenda 2010 reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .
" the ' agenda 2010 ' is an instrument and not the final goal .
it can be adjusted . "
schröder , who ruled from 1998 to 2005 , urged the party to remind voters of what the spd has accomplished in the past decade in areas such as energy , climate , immigration and social policies .
" the conservatives fought us for that and now they 're copying us , " he said .
" you 're the original .
they 're the fakes . "
cdu general secretary ronald pofalla accused beck of pushing the spd to the left .
" he 's taking the party backwards instead of looking forward , " pofalla said .
beck insisted friday he was not moving the spd sharply leftwards , but only wanted a " careful readjustment " of the market reforms .
beck said he wants to correct the reforms " at a number of points , but without going backwards . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "

beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "

economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .

" the international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , the french league for human rights -lrb- ldh -rrb- , the us center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and germany 's european center for constitutional and human rights -lrb- ecchr -rrb- filed the joint suit before a paris prosecutor on thursday . in a statement posted on the fidh website , the groups say that during his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses in us-run detention centers at abu ghraib in iraq and guantanamo bay in cuba , as well as elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld was the us defense secretary from 2001 to 2006 the rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by rumsfeld between october 2002 and april 2003 " legitimizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs . the group also has testimony from janis karpinski - the one-time commander of us military prisons in iraq - to bolster its claims . images rocked the world the abu ghraib jail in iraq made headlines in april 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers were leaked to the media . former prisoners at guantanamo bay are suing rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse and humiliation at abu ghraib was captured in 100s of photos the us denies any torture has taken place in its detention centers and has defended its interrogation techniques . rumsfeld in paris the plaintiffs argue in their filing that french courts have universal jurisdiction - allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad - under the 1984 convention against torture , which was been ratified by both the united states and france . the group says rumsfeld , who is in paris for a talk sponsored by foreign policy magazine , should be arrested while he was in france . " we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .
an appeal will be filed against this decision next week . three other cases have been filed against rumsfeld in argentina , spain and sweden . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .

on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .

putin confirmed that russia would invite osce observers to its forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .
but the key issues which experts had highlighted before the summit remained unsolved .
neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .
the eu 's plans to ban any company from its energy markets which both produces and distributes energy had also drawn russian fire before the meeting .

the issue of plans to install a missile-defense system in eu members poland and the czech republic surfaced friday when putin compared the situation to the 1962 cuban missile crisis .
at the same time , putin suggested the tension was much lower than during the cuban missile crisis because he feels the us is listening to moscow 's concerns about the missile plans .

the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .
the eu 's plans to ban any company from its energy markets which both produces and distributes energy had also drawn russian fire before the meeting .
russian officials say that the measure is aimed at keeping russian gas monopolist gazprom out of europe .

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .
" we already have two european organizations that look at human rights , " said nils muiznieks , a former integration minister and expert on eu-russia relations at the latvian university .
" russia is trying to destroy both of them .
why do we need a third ? "
few agreements reached at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another cuban missile crisis ?
on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .
they also established a body to promote cultural exchanges .
putin confirmed that russia would invite osce observers to its forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .

subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .

the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "
meanwhile , human rights groups , including amnesty international , urged eu leaders to confront putin at the summit on what many see as the kremlin 's dubious human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "
meanwhile , human rights groups , including amnesty international , urged eu leaders to confront putin at the summit on what many see as the kremlin 's dubious human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .

subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 26.10.2007 eu , russia remain divided over key issues at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of smiles but little substance - putin with socrates russia and the european union discussed cooperating on human rights , drug enforcement and cultural exchanges at a summit that however acheived little on key sticking points . vladimir putin , in his final eu summit as president , sparred with the eu over energy and trade in a one-day meeting that will likely be remembered for the russian president 's comments drawing a parallel between us plans for a missile shield in eastern europe and the cuban missile crisis in 1962 , widely regarded as the closest the world came to nuclear war .
" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .
" we already have two european organizations that look at human rights , " said nils muiznieks , a former integration minister and expert on eu-russia relations at the latvian university .
" russia is trying to destroy both of them .
why do we need a third ? "
few agreements reached at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another cuban missile crisis ?
on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .
they also established a body to promote cultural exchanges .
putin confirmed that russia would invite osce observers to its forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .
but the key issues which experts had highlighted before the summit remained unsolved .
neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .
the eu 's plans to ban any company from its energy markets which both produces and distributes energy had also drawn russian fire before the meeting .
russian officials say that the measure is aimed at keeping russian gas monopolist gazprom out of europe .
putin likens tensions to cuban missile crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit a step towards normalizing relations while the portuguese summit seemed to restore normalcy to the eu-russia relationship , the same can not be said for the ongoing tension between russia and the united states .
the issue of plans to install a missile-defense system in eu members poland and the czech republic surfaced friday when putin compared the situation to the 1962 cuban missile crisis .
at the same time , putin suggested the tension was much lower than during the cuban missile crisis because he feels the us is listening to moscow 's concerns about the missile plans .
" on a positive note , i note that concerns about threats to our security are being heard by the americans , " putin said .
" our american partners are thinking about how to neutralize these threats that are being created .
our work continues . "

with more than six billion people , earth 's population is now so big that " the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available , " the report warned , adding that the global population is expected to peak at between 8 and 9.7 billion by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans are using too many of the planet 's resources each person needs 22 hectares of the earth 's surface to supply their needs , but the earth 's biological capacity is only 16 per person , the un report calculated . endangered ecosystems according to the report , which was released on thursday evening in new york , the condition of the land , sea , air and rivers have all deteriorated in the past 20 years . fishing capacity is nearly four times more than is sustainable and species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than fossil records show - over 30 percent of amphibians , 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to safe water is already a problem for millions of people in two decades time , drinking water will become scarce , affecting some 1.8 million people .

speaking at the report 's release , unep executive director achim steiner said that the " systematic destruction of the earth 's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged .

there has also been the creation of " a greenhouse-gas emission reduction treaty along with innovative carbon trading and carbon offset markets , " he added . but unfortunately , these cases were the exception rather than the rule . " all too often -lrb- the response -rrb- has been slow and at a pace and scale that fails to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet , " steiner said . according to the report , the fourth in a series , the earth has experienced five mass extinctions in 450 million years , the latest of which occurred 65 million years ago .

observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "
meanwhile , human rights groups , including amnesty international , urged eu leaders to confront putin at the summit on what many see as the kremlin 's dubious human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good . "
anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "
meanwhile , human rights groups , including amnesty international , urged eu leaders to confront putin at the summit on what many see as the kremlin 's dubious human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , the french league for human rights -lrb- ldh -rrb- , the us center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and germany 's european center for constitutional and human rights -lrb- ecchr -rrb- filed the joint suit before a paris prosecutor on thursday . in a statement posted on the fidh website , the groups say that during his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses in us-run detention centers at abu ghraib in iraq and guantanamo bay in cuba , as well as elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld was the us defense secretary from 2001 to 2006 the rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by rumsfeld between october 2002 and april 2003 " legitimizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs . the group also has testimony from janis karpinski - the one-time commander of us military prisons in iraq - to bolster its claims . images rocked the world the abu ghraib jail in iraq made headlines in april 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers were leaked to the media . former prisoners at guantanamo bay are suing rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse and humiliation at abu ghraib was captured in 100s of photos the us denies any torture has taken place in its detention centers and has defended its interrogation techniques . rumsfeld in paris the plaintiffs argue in their filing that french courts have universal jurisdiction - allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad - under the 1984 convention against torture , which was been ratified by both the united states and france . the group says rumsfeld , who is in paris for a talk sponsored by foreign policy magazine , should be arrested while he was in france . " we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .
an appeal will be filed against this decision next week . three other cases have been filed against rumsfeld in argentina , spain and sweden . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "

beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .
business confidence continues to drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are expected to slow while economists also expect an economic slowdown , the government predicted that the german economy will continue doing well for the rest of the year .
the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .
" the results indicate that the upswing will continue but at a slower pace , " an ifo statement quoted president hans-werner sinn as saying .
consumer spending could provide boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher employment levels could help keep growth on track the ifo survey showed that of the 7,000 companies asked about their expectations for the next six months , manufacturers were worried , but other sectors seemed positive about their outlook .
the retail sector was particularly positive .
this suggests that " german consumers might have started to open their wallets amid a continuing improvement in employment and slightly more generous pay deals , " bank of american analyst gilles moec told the afp news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 26.10.2007 eu , russia remain divided over key issues at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of smiles but little substance - putin with socrates russia and the european union discussed cooperating on human rights , drug enforcement and cultural exchanges at a summit that however acheived little on key sticking points . vladimir putin , in his final eu summit as president , sparred with the eu over energy and trade in a one-day meeting that will likely be remembered for the russian president 's comments drawing a parallel between us plans for a missile shield in eastern europe and the cuban missile crisis in 1962 , widely regarded as the closest the world came to nuclear war .
" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .
" we already have two european organizations that look at human rights , " said nils muiznieks , a former integration minister and expert on eu-russia relations at the latvian university .
" russia is trying to destroy both of them .
why do we need a third ? "
few agreements reached at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another cuban missile crisis ?
on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .
they also established a body to promote cultural exchanges .
putin confirmed that russia would invite osce observers to its forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .
but the key issues which experts had highlighted before the summit remained unsolved .
neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .
the eu 's plans to ban any company from its energy markets which both produces and distributes energy had also drawn russian fire before the meeting .
russian officials say that the measure is aimed at keeping russian gas monopolist gazprom out of europe .
putin likens tensions to cuban missile crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit a step towards normalizing relations while the portuguese summit seemed to restore normalcy to the eu-russia relationship , the same can not be said for the ongoing tension between russia and the united states .
the issue of plans to install a missile-defense system in eu members poland and the czech republic surfaced friday when putin compared the situation to the 1962 cuban missile crisis .
at the same time , putin suggested the tension was much lower than during the cuban missile crisis because he feels the us is listening to moscow 's concerns about the missile plans .
" on a positive note , i note that concerns about threats to our security are being heard by the americans , " putin said .
" our american partners are thinking about how to neutralize these threats that are being created .
our work continues . "

spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "

beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .

economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.10.2007 germany 's social democrats hint at shift to the left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader kurt beck is leading the swerve to the left in an effort to pull itself out of a poll slump , germany 's social democrats have signalled they 'll scale back a key reform passed by former chancellor schröder in order to win back the party 's disillusioned base . germany 's embattled center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began a three-day party congress in the northern city of hamburg on friday , oct .
26 to seek ways to shore up flagging support and resolve a bitter row over painful labor market reforms passed by former chancellor gerhard schröder .
spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .
the spd has a lot of ground to make up if it wants to re-take the chancellery in the 2009 elections .
reforms to be partly rolled back the spd is also wrangling over its future course ever since beck this month said the government should reverse cuts in jobless benefits for elderly unemployed people introduced schröder 's agenda 2010 package of sweeping labor and social reforms which sparked major nation-wide demonstrations .
economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .
schröder , who spoke at the spd conference , said he was not worried about the decision to scale back his agenda 2010 reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .
" the ' agenda 2010 ' is an instrument and not the final goal .
it can be adjusted . "
schröder , who ruled from 1998 to 2005 , urged the party to remind voters of what the spd has accomplished in the past decade in areas such as energy , climate , immigration and social policies .
" the conservatives fought us for that and now they 're copying us , " he said .
" you 're the original .
they 're the fakes . "
cdu general secretary ronald pofalla accused beck of pushing the spd to the left .
" he 's taking the party backwards instead of looking forward , " pofalla said .
beck insisted friday he was not moving the spd sharply leftwards , but only wanted a " careful readjustment " of the market reforms .
beck said he wants to correct the reforms " at a number of points , but without going backwards . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , the french league for human rights -lrb- ldh -rrb- , the us center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and germany 's european center for constitutional and human rights -lrb- ecchr -rrb- filed the joint suit before a paris prosecutor on thursday . in a statement posted on the fidh website , the groups say that during his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses in us-run detention centers at abu ghraib in iraq and guantanamo bay in cuba , as well as elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld was the us defense secretary from 2001 to 2006 the rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by rumsfeld between october 2002 and april 2003 " legitimizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs . the group also has testimony from janis karpinski - the one-time commander of us military prisons in iraq - to bolster its claims . images rocked the world the abu ghraib jail in iraq made headlines in april 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers were leaked to the media . former prisoners at guantanamo bay are suing rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse and humiliation at abu ghraib was captured in 100s of photos the us denies any torture has taken place in its detention centers and has defended its interrogation techniques . rumsfeld in paris the plaintiffs argue in their filing that french courts have universal jurisdiction - allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad - under the 1984 convention against torture , which was been ratified by both the united states and france . the group says rumsfeld , who is in paris for a talk sponsored by foreign policy magazine , should be arrested while he was in france . " we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .
an appeal will be filed against this decision next week . three other cases have been filed against rumsfeld in argentina , spain and sweden . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.10.2007 opinion : time to shift focus in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the us urged nato allies to help share the burden of the fighting in afghanistan at a meeting of defense ministers in noordwijk this week , dw 's christoph hasselbach says there 's still time to make the mission work . in europe , many nato member countries are getting fed up with demands , primarily from washington , for greater military involvement in afghanistan - demands that have persisted ever since the launch of the nato mission .
for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .
in iraq , this realization came too late .
in afghanistan , there 's still time for nato to act .

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .
in iraq , this realization came too late .
in afghanistan , there 's still time for nato to act .

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .

anatoly chubais , ceo of russia 's electricity monopoly ues , said that trade turnover between the eu and russia had gone up by a factor of 3.5 over the last seven years to reach an annual 209 billion euros -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .
putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .

" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "

" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .

taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .

the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .
ongoing global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic outlook predicts growth will be modest the current crisis in the us housing market could negatively impact the german banking sector in the upcoming year , although the fallout remains unclear , glos said .
the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .
business confidence continues to drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are expected to slow while economists also expect an economic slowdown , the government predicted that the german economy will continue doing well for the rest of the year .
the government increased its growth estimates for 2007 from the previous 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent .
on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .
but the munich-based economic research institute ifo said the drop from 104.2 points in september to 103.9 points in october was not as big as expected .
" the results indicate that the upswing will continue but at a slower pace , " an ifo statement quoted president hans-werner sinn as saying .
consumer spending could provide boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher employment levels could help keep growth on track the ifo survey showed that of the 7,000 companies asked about their expectations for the next six months , manufacturers were worried , but other sectors seemed positive about their outlook .
the retail sector was particularly positive .
this suggests that " german consumers might have started to open their wallets amid a continuing improvement in employment and slightly more generous pay deals , " bank of american analyst gilles moec told the afp news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the rest of this year , germany 's economic growth looks better than expected .
but next year does n't look as promising .
the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .
while the country will experience modest growth next year , it will be slower than this year , the government said .
a slowdown in german exports is one cause for the predicted slowdown .
another factor is an expected global credit crunch , germany 's economics and technology minister michael glos said thursday .
while the economy will have " less momentum , " it will continue to expand , glos said .
" the economic dynamic remains intact and stands on a solid basis , " glos said .

the export sector is also expected to slow as the global economy loses steam and the euro continues its strength relative to the dollar .
glos said he expects growth to shift from exports to the domestic economy .
the government 's economic projections followed warnings last week from germany 's leading economic institutes that growth was expected to be slower in the upcoming year .
the institutes predict a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2008 and called on chancellor angela merkel to press ahead with economic reforms .

on thursday , a closely-watched business climate index showed that business confidence dropped in october .

26 to seek ways to shore up flagging support and resolve a bitter row over painful labor market reforms passed by former chancellor gerhard schröder .
spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .
the spd has a lot of ground to make up if it wants to re-take the chancellery in the 2009 elections .
reforms to be partly rolled back the spd is also wrangling over its future course ever since beck this month said the government should reverse cuts in jobless benefits for elderly unemployed people introduced schröder 's agenda 2010 package of sweeping labor and social reforms which sparked major nation-wide demonstrations .
economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .
schröder , who spoke at the spd conference , said he was not worried about the decision to scale back his agenda 2010 reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .
" the ' agenda 2010 ' is an instrument and not the final goal .
it can be adjusted . "
schröder , who ruled from 1998 to 2005 , urged the party to remind voters of what the spd has accomplished in the past decade in areas such as energy , climate , immigration and social policies .
" the conservatives fought us for that and now they 're copying us , " he said .
" you 're the original .
they 're the fakes . "
cdu general secretary ronald pofalla accused beck of pushing the spd to the left .
" he 's taking the party backwards instead of looking forward , " pofalla said .

" we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .
an appeal will be filed against this decision next week . three other cases have been filed against rumsfeld in argentina , spain and sweden . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .

neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .

the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .

the issue of plans to install a missile-defense system in eu members poland and the czech republic surfaced friday when putin compared the situation to the 1962 cuban missile crisis .

" the international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , the french league for human rights -lrb- ldh -rrb- , the us center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and germany 's european center for constitutional and human rights -lrb- ecchr -rrb- filed the joint suit before a paris prosecutor on thursday . in a statement posted on the fidh website , the groups say that during his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses in us-run detention centers at abu ghraib in iraq and guantanamo bay in cuba , as well as elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld was the us defense secretary from 2001 to 2006 the rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by rumsfeld between october 2002 and april 2003 " legitimizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs . the group also has testimony from janis karpinski - the one-time commander of us military prisons in iraq - to bolster its claims . images rocked the world the abu ghraib jail in iraq made headlines in april 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers were leaked to the media . former prisoners at guantanamo bay are suing rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse and humiliation at abu ghraib was captured in 100s of photos the us denies any torture has taken place in its detention centers and has defended its interrogation techniques . rumsfeld in paris the plaintiffs argue in their filing that french courts have universal jurisdiction - allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad - under the 1984 convention against torture , which was been ratified by both the united states and france . the group says rumsfeld , who is in paris for a talk sponsored by foreign policy magazine , should be arrested while he was in france . " we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .
an appeal will be filed against this decision next week . three other cases have been filed against rumsfeld in argentina , spain and sweden . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .

spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .

economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .

with more than six billion people , earth 's population is now so big that " the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available , " the report warned , adding that the global population is expected to peak at between 8 and 9.7 billion by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans are using too many of the planet 's resources each person needs 22 hectares of the earth 's surface to supply their needs , but the earth 's biological capacity is only 16 per person , the un report calculated . endangered ecosystems according to the report , which was released on thursday evening in new york , the condition of the land , sea , air and rivers have all deteriorated in the past 20 years . fishing capacity is nearly four times more than is sustainable and species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than fossil records show - over 30 percent of amphibians , 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to safe water is already a problem for millions of people in two decades time , drinking water will become scarce , affecting some 1.8 million people .

speaking at the report 's release , unep executive director achim steiner said that the " systematic destruction of the earth 's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged . " he warned , the " bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay . " some positives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner from the unep was critical of government responses on a note of encouragement , steiner said the global response in the two decades since has in some cases been " courageous and inspiring " . " over the past 20 years , the international community has cut , by 95 percent , the production of ozone-layer damaging chemicals , " steiner said .
there has also been the creation of " a greenhouse-gas emission reduction treaty along with innovative carbon trading and carbon offset markets , " he added . but unfortunately , these cases were the exception rather than the rule . " all too often -lrb- the response -rrb- has been slow and at a pace and scale that fails to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet , " steiner said . according to the report , the fourth in a series , the earth has experienced five mass extinctions in 450 million years , the latest of which occurred 65 million years ago .

" the international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , the french league for human rights -lrb- ldh -rrb- , the us center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and germany 's european center for constitutional and human rights -lrb- ecchr -rrb- filed the joint suit before a paris prosecutor on thursday . in a statement posted on the fidh website , the groups say that during his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses in us-run detention centers at abu ghraib in iraq and guantanamo bay in cuba , as well as elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld was the us defense secretary from 2001 to 2006 the rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by rumsfeld between october 2002 and april 2003 " legitimizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs . the group also has testimony from janis karpinski - the one-time commander of us military prisons in iraq - to bolster its claims . images rocked the world the abu ghraib jail in iraq made headlines in april 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers were leaked to the media . former prisoners at guantanamo bay are suing rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse and humiliation at abu ghraib was captured in 100s of photos the us denies any torture has taken place in its detention centers and has defended its interrogation techniques . rumsfeld in paris the plaintiffs argue in their filing that french courts have universal jurisdiction - allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad - under the 1984 convention against torture , which was been ratified by both the united states and france . the group says rumsfeld , who is in paris for a talk sponsored by foreign policy magazine , should be arrested while he was in france . " we will only stop once the american authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , " ccr chief michael ratner said in a statement posted on the fidh web site . " donald rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .
an appeal will be filed against this decision next week . three other cases have been filed against rumsfeld in argentina , spain and sweden . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .
but according to the afp news agency , russia has protested against eu plans for reforming its domestic energy market , saying these unfairly discriminate against state-controlled gas giant gazprom and other russian energy companies .
economic relations " good " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates -lrb- r -rrb- with putin while he conceded that there were " serious problems " ahead on energy and investment , russian deputy prime minister sergei naryshkin told participants at a conference on the eve of the summit that economic relations were nonetheless " good .

putin calls for patience also on the agenda is the question of iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's status is still uncertain in the run-up to the talks , putin warned western powers against adopting harsh policies towards iran over its nuclear program and calling for " patience " in resolving the future status of kosovo .
" why upset the principles of international law by encouraging separatism in europe ? "
putin asked in reference to kosovo after meeting his portuguese counterpart anibal cavaco silva in lisbon on thursday .
" why make the situation worse , bring it to a dead end , threaten sanctions or even military action , " putin asked .
" you can run around like mad people wielding razor blades but it is not the best way to resolve the problem . "
russia has gone against the position of most western powers by both failing to back tighter sanctions against iran and opposing moves towards independence for kosovo , a southern serbian province .
but putin was playing down hostilities .
" i do not think relations with europe are in a regrettable shape , " reuters quoted him on thursday .
" there are simply issues on which we disagree . "
meanwhile , human rights groups , including amnesty international , urged eu leaders to confront putin at the summit on what many see as the kremlin 's dubious human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , with eu officials keen to thaw the increasingly frosty relations between brussels and moscow . the meeting , which marks 10 years since brussels and moscow signed a partnership agreement , will be the last summit attended by putin as russian president - and looks set to be a tense one .
taking place in the former portuguese royal residence of mafra near lisbon , the talks are hosted by portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , alongside eu foreign policy chief javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
a dispute over a russian ban on imported polish meat has so far been a spanner in the works of talks on the new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace the original deal , which expires at the end of 2007 .
however , hopes of a breakthrough were boosted by the victory in poland 's parliamentary elections last sunday of a liberal pro-european party that pledged to improve relations with moscow .
the energy controversy the new partnership accord is set to contain a chapter on energy - a fraught issue expected to dominate friday 's talks .
as the eu 's main supplier of oil and gas , russia has locked horns with the bloc over brussels ' plans to vet foreign investment in european energy networks , as well as moscow 's reluctance to allow eu companies access to russian pipelines .
observers expect the summit will result in more conciliatory talk about improving energy relations , with the unveiling of a new mechanism to warn european countries ahead of time about possible cuts in energy supply from russia .

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .

subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .

a torturer is an enemy of humanity , " he added . previous cases filed this is the sixth torture suit to be filed against the former us defense chief . two previous criminal complaints were filed in germany under its universal jurisdiction statute , which allows germany to prosecute serious international crimes regardless of where they occurred or the nationality of the perpetrators or victims . one of these cases was dismissed in 2005 , while a second case was rejected in april 2007 .

the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent . while germany wo n't likely go through an economic growth spurt in 2008 , it is expected to have a modest growth rate of 2.0 percent , according to new government forecasts released on thursday , oct .
25 .

26 to seek ways to shore up flagging support and resolve a bitter row over painful labor market reforms passed by former chancellor gerhard schröder .
spd kurt beck , who was elected by delegates later in the day to a new two-year term with a strong 95.5 percent tally , launched an attack on his christian democrat coalition partners with a hard-hitting speech acccusing them of trying to hide their neo-liberal agenda and trying to steal spd voters .
referring to christian democrat chancellor angela merkel 's recent push for the benefits of germany 's economic recovery to be spread across the population , beck said : " we welcome ms merkel 's comments , but there is a copyright on such social democratic ideas . "
spd looks to regain lost ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering , left is opposed to scaling back key labor market reforms merkel has gained popularity by crusading for traditional spd causes such as the fight against climate change and programs to support families and children .
beck , who trails merkel in personal popularity polls , has vowed that the spd will no longer let merkel take credit for the coalition 's accomplishments while the spd gets blamed for its failings .
the spd 's abandonment of traditional socialist compassion is believed to have been a major reason the party has lost ground to the cdu .
" at their core , the conservatives are still a party of neo-liberals and free market radicals , " said beck , 58 .
" they are now pretending to be in favour of social policies but in reality they are still pursuing neo-liberal goals . "
there 's a sense of urgency in the spd that the party needs to regain its vision .
recent polls show that voters are abandoning the party in droves .
its approval rate has dropped to below 30 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 .
the cdu has since risen towards 40 percent from 34.9 percent in 2005 .
the spd has a lot of ground to make up if it wants to re-take the chancellery in the 2009 elections .
reforms to be partly rolled back the spd is also wrangling over its future course ever since beck this month said the government should reverse cuts in jobless benefits for elderly unemployed people introduced schröder 's agenda 2010 package of sweeping labor and social reforms which sparked major nation-wide demonstrations .
economists , business groups and some senior spd politicians , led by vice-chancellor franz müntefering , have attacked the proposal , arguing that germany should not leave its economic reform course .
despite the opposition , many party members indicated their support for scaling back the reforms .
members agreed to stick to their decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 , but to do so more gradually .
they also decided to prolong unemployment benefits for elderly workers .
reforms can be " adjusted " : schröder the decision to give workers 24 months of unemployment benefits is seen as an about-face for the spd .
schröder , who spoke at the spd conference , said he was not worried about the decision to scale back his agenda 2010 reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suave schröder says the reforms can be " adjusted " speaking at the congress , schröder indirectly criticised beck by arguing that changes to agenda 2010 were possible but should be made to make the reforms " better " and not just because the changes are " popular . "
" support him -lrb- beck -rrb- and the work of the spd ministers , " schröder said ahead of friday evening 's vote .
" the ' agenda 2010 ' is an instrument and not the final goal .
it can be adjusted . "
schröder , who ruled from 1998 to 2005 , urged the party to remind voters of what the spd has accomplished in the past decade in areas such as energy , climate , immigration and social policies .
" the conservatives fought us for that and now they 're copying us , " he said .
" you 're the original .
they 're the fakes . "
cdu general secretary ronald pofalla accused beck of pushing the spd to the left .
" he 's taking the party backwards instead of looking forward , " pofalla said .
beck insisted friday he was not moving the spd sharply leftwards , but only wanted a " careful readjustment " of the market reforms .
beck said he wants to correct the reforms " at a number of points , but without going backwards . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for years , secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has been doing the rounds of the european capitals lobbying for more troops , helicopters and transport aircraft , only to be fobbed off with vague promises .
germany has finally agreed to extend its broad activities in afghanistan by deploying reconnaissance tornados , but it refuses to send soldiers to the hostile south of the country .
given the public 's waning support for the mission and berlin 's political status quo , this is simply out of the question .
other countries have pledged a total of several hundred more troops , but it remains to be seen if and when they will ever arrive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach but interestingly , the focus of us demands has shifted .
both de hoop scheffer and afghan president hamid karsai are attaching new significance to training the afghan forces .
according to nato 's secretary general , the country needs to stand on its own two feet .
subsequently , german defense minister franz josef jung announced at noordwijk in the netherlands on wednesday , oct .
24 , that berlin would be tripling the number of german military trainers in the strife-torn country .
the principle that afghanistan needs to stand on its own two feet should be the bedrock of nato 's entire afghanistan mission .
but this obvious truth has long been forgotten .
not only the number of military casualties explains the skepticism on the part of the european public .
basically , people feel that the afghanistan mission is a potentially bottomless pit .
theoretically , no help will ever be enough .
will the country ever reach a point when it can look after itself ?
these days , military leaders are intelligent enough to know that naming a date is futile .
observers say that day will never come , but it looks as though nato forces might remain in the hindu kush for years , if not decades .
the western countries have little option but to stay put , even if the mission is a waste of human life and taxpayers ' money .
clearly , it calls for considerable sacrifice - every soldier who dies is one too many .
but what would be the cost of another fundamentalist government in afghanistan ?
were this ever to happen , nato would most certainly have been wasting its time .
as it stands , nato has no choice but to persevere in its afghanistan project .
whether germany likes it or not , the project is about fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
but washington appears to have recognized that this fight is not only a question of military might .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy consisting of military deployment , civilian rebuilding and training local security forces .
in iraq , this realization came too late .
in afghanistan , there 's still time for nato to act .

" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .

on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .
they also established a body to promote cultural exchanges .
putin confirmed that russia would invite osce observers to its forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .
but the key issues which experts had highlighted before the summit remained unsolved .
neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .

at the same time , putin suggested the tension was much lower than during the cuban missile crisis because he feels the us is listening to moscow 's concerns about the missile plans .
" on a positive note , i note that concerns about threats to our security are being heard by the americans , " putin said .

with more than six billion people , earth 's population is now so big that " the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available , " the report warned , adding that the global population is expected to peak at between 8 and 9.7 billion by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans are using too many of the planet 's resources each person needs 22 hectares of the earth 's surface to supply their needs , but the earth 's biological capacity is only 16 per person , the un report calculated . endangered ecosystems according to the report , which was released on thursday evening in new york , the condition of the land , sea , air and rivers have all deteriorated in the past 20 years . fishing capacity is nearly four times more than is sustainable and species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than fossil records show - over 30 percent of amphibians , 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to safe water is already a problem for millions of people in two decades time , drinking water will become scarce , affecting some 1.8 million people .

speaking at the report 's release , unep executive director achim steiner said that the " systematic destruction of the earth 's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged . " he warned , the " bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay . " some positives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner from the unep was critical of government responses on a note of encouragement , steiner said the global response in the two decades since has in some cases been " courageous and inspiring " . " over the past 20 years , the international community has cut , by 95 percent , the production of ozone-layer damaging chemicals , " steiner said .
there has also been the creation of " a greenhouse-gas emission reduction treaty along with innovative carbon trading and carbon offset markets , " he added . but unfortunately , these cases were the exception rather than the rule . " all too often -lrb- the response -rrb- has been slow and at a pace and scale that fails to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet , " steiner said . according to the report , the fourth in a series , the earth has experienced five mass extinctions in 450 million years , the latest of which occurred 65 million years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 26.10.2007 eu , russia remain divided over key issues at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of smiles but little substance - putin with socrates russia and the european union discussed cooperating on human rights , drug enforcement and cultural exchanges at a summit that however acheived little on key sticking points . vladimir putin , in his final eu summit as president , sparred with the eu over energy and trade in a one-day meeting that will likely be remembered for the russian president 's comments drawing a parallel between us plans for a missile shield in eastern europe and the cuban missile crisis in 1962 , widely regarded as the closest the world came to nuclear war .
" this was a constructive summit , a positive event .
it has led to several significant steps toward building a deeper relationship between the eu and russia , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who hosted the meeting in the town of mafra near lisbon .
" the development of our trade is clear for all to see .
that is the keynote of our relationship , " he added .
the atmosphere on friday was relaxed and jovial .
besides socrates , russian president vladimir putin , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana and the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , were in attendance .
" we are satisfied with the results of this meeting , which was held in a friendly atmosphere and a constructive manner , " putin said .
human rights institute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - putin , center , with barosso and socrates putin suggested that the eu and russia should set up a joint institute to discuss issues of human rights across the continent .
" i am happy to put forward a joint initiative from the two houses of the russian parliament to establish an eu-russian center for human rights and democracy .
this could bring together politicians , businessmen and civil society , " putin told journalists .
" given russia 's growing financial and economic potential , we should be able to make some contributions to financing discussions on human rights and democracy , " he added .
eu leaders welcomed the move , saying that it could " move forward " the relationship between the two sides .
previous eu-russia meetings have often been clouded by mutual accusations of human rights abuses .
human rights experts said putin 's support for human rights was pure political rhetoric .
" we already have two european organizations that look at human rights , " said nils muiznieks , a former integration minister and expert on eu-russia relations at the latvian university .
" russia is trying to destroy both of them .
why do we need a third ? "
few agreements reached at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another cuban missile crisis ?
on friday , the eu and russia signed agreements on raising quotas of russian steel imports and cooperating in the fight against drugs .
they also established a body to promote cultural exchanges .
putin confirmed that russia would invite osce observers to its forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .
but the key issues which experts had highlighted before the summit remained unsolved .
neither of the two most contentious issues which experts raised before the meeting - a polish veto on a future eu-russia strategic agreement in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , and the fee that russia charges eu airlines to fly over its territory - was directly mentioned in the press conference .
the strategic deal is blocked by an " internal eu issue " which russia hopes will be " solved as soon as possible , " putin said in the only reference to the polish dispute .
the issue of siberian overflights was not mentioned at all .
the eu 's plans to ban any company from its energy markets which both produces and distributes energy had also drawn russian fire before the meeting .
russian officials say that the measure is aimed at keeping russian gas monopolist gazprom out of europe .
putin likens tensions to cuban missile crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit a step towards normalizing relations while the portuguese summit seemed to restore normalcy to the eu-russia relationship , the same can not be said for the ongoing tension between russia and the united states .
the issue of plans to install a missile-defense system in eu members poland and the czech republic surfaced friday when putin compared the situation to the 1962 cuban missile crisis .
at the same time , putin suggested the tension was much lower than during the cuban missile crisis because he feels the us is listening to moscow 's concerns about the missile plans .
" on a positive note , i note that concerns about threats to our security are being heard by the americans , " putin said .
" our american partners are thinking about how to neutralize these threats that are being created .
our work continues . "

she praised the economic record of her husband 's government during a rally in buenos aires .

cristina fernandez kirchner told a crowd in a buenos aires suburb : " some of our dreams have started to be realised , and now we need to work on the remaining dreams . "

strike action over job regrading could be resumed if the negotiations fail .
a confidentiality clause has been agreed by employers and unions meeting at the agency , but it appears there has been little progress .
a strike by one of the unions involved , nipsa , led to the closure of 27 special schools for 10 days .
three more days of talks are planned before the deadline of next tuesday .
nipsa 's action was suspended to allow for further talks , but the union said its strike would resume if its main demands were not met , and it is making contingency plans to call its members out again .
its hardship allowance has been raised from fifteen to twenty five pounds a day .
after tuesday 's deadline , the other three unions in the talks are expected to go ahead with their plans to ballot members on the employers ' offer .

the us treasury under-secretary for domestic finance , robert steel , said that government intervention could be counterproductive .
and he warned such action could cause credit and mortgage markets to dry up .
up to two million us families with sub-prime mortgages could lose their homes as the credit crunch intensifies .
banks and mortgage companies are tightening lending up further as world credit markets have frozen up , with investors refusing to buy mortgage-backed securities .
wave of foreclosures mr steel said that the focus of the government efforts was to encourage lenders not to repossess homes , by bringing them together with borrowers .
he pointed out that half of borrowers never talked to lenders before going into arrears .
" we need to encourage lenders to be flexible , so that the people who figure this out can stay in their homes , " he said but he pointed out that some level of foreclosure was inevitable .
" there is a natural rate of foreclosure , in good times or bad , in the economy .
and that is just the nature of how our economy works .
not everything can be successful . "
the government is increasing its level of funding to debt counselling and other local services .
however , so far there seems to be little increase in mortgages that have been renegotiated on better terms .
financial institutions need to play their part , mr steel says according to mark zandi , the chief economist of ratings agency moody 's , only 1 % of sub-prime mortgages have been modified so far .
but recently one of the biggest sub-prime lenders , countrywide , announced a plan to help 80,000 borrowers with $ 16bn in outstanding mortgages to renegotiate terms .
restoring the credit markets mr steel was optimistic that " things were returning to normal " in the credit markets .
however , he admitted that " it 's going to take a while for this to work through " .
and he was particularly encouraged by the plan by three big us banks to set up a special $ 80bn superfund to try to restore investor confidence by pooling high-grade , safer investments together in one pool - a plan that was put together in the us treasury under the auspices of mr steel .
the hope is that investors will buy into this fund , and it will unfreeze the short-term asset-backed commercial paper market .
the under-secretary admitted that there were still problems remaining in this area .
but he said he hoped the fund would " provide a perspective on how to think about this issue " .
it was the logical outcome of the series of discussions between the us treasury and the private sector after the crisis broke , he said .
mr steel explained that the government had " convened people here " -lrb- at the treasury -rrb- to understand how the market was thinking , and was supportive of the private sector plan that emerged from that meeting .
the department even issued a press release supporting the proposal .
however , as this fund is still being created , there are still doubts as to whether investors or other international banks will join in this effort .
mr steel said that while there was no " plan b " , the markets were already adjusting by selling off some of the distressed debt .
the size of that adjustment also became clearer this week when big us investment merrill lynch revealed a $ 8bn loss on its sub-prime lending portfolio .
and earlier this week the head of the iif international bankers ' association , josef ackermannl , also the boss of deutsche bank , said that banks will have to take their losses - but that their underlying profits were strong enough to stand the strain .
slowing economy mr steel said that the us economy was still showing underlying strength and the treasury was not worried about a recession .
but he accepted that the problems in the housing market would provide a " penalty to growth " .
" housing has been providing a headwind to the economy , and there is a penalty to growth from the current situation in housing , " he said .
the size of that penalty is still unclear .
both the imf and the us homebuilders association expect the us growth rate in the first half of the year to be cut in half , and the us federal reserve has reduced its economic forecast by three-quarters of a percentage point as a result of the housing slowdown .
next week it meets to decide us interest rates .
and many economists believe that the fate of the us economy is now as much in the hands of the fed as the treasury .

up to two million us families with sub-prime mortgages could lose their homes as the credit crunch intensifies .
banks and mortgage companies are tightening lending up further as world credit markets have frozen up , with investors refusing to buy mortgage-backed securities .
wave of foreclosures mr steel said that the focus of the government efforts was to encourage lenders not to repossess homes , by bringing them together with borrowers .
he pointed out that half of borrowers never talked to lenders before going into arrears .
" we need to encourage lenders to be flexible , so that the people who figure this out can stay in their homes , " he said but he pointed out that some level of foreclosure was inevitable .
" there is a natural rate of foreclosure , in good times or bad , in the economy .
and that is just the nature of how our economy works .
not everything can be successful . "
the government is increasing its level of funding to debt counselling and other local services .
however , so far there seems to be little increase in mortgages that have been renegotiated on better terms .
financial institutions need to play their part , mr steel says according to mark zandi , the chief economist of ratings agency moody 's , only 1 % of sub-prime mortgages have been modified so far .
but recently one of the biggest sub-prime lenders , countrywide , announced a plan to help 80,000 borrowers with $ 16bn in outstanding mortgages to renegotiate terms .
restoring the credit markets mr steel was optimistic that " things were returning to normal " in the credit markets .
however , he admitted that " it 's going to take a while for this to work through " .
and he was particularly encouraged by the plan by three big us banks to set up a special $ 80bn superfund to try to restore investor confidence by pooling high-grade , safer investments together in one pool - a plan that was put together in the us treasury under the auspices of mr steel .
the hope is that investors will buy into this fund , and it will unfreeze the short-term asset-backed commercial paper market .
the under-secretary admitted that there were still problems remaining in this area .
but he said he hoped the fund would " provide a perspective on how to think about this issue " .
it was the logical outcome of the series of discussions between the us treasury and the private sector after the crisis broke , he said .
mr steel explained that the government had " convened people here " -lrb- at the treasury -rrb- to understand how the market was thinking , and was supportive of the private sector plan that emerged from that meeting .
the department even issued a press release supporting the proposal .
however , as this fund is still being created , there are still doubts as to whether investors or other international banks will join in this effort .
mr steel said that while there was no " plan b " , the markets were already adjusting by selling off some of the distressed debt .
the size of that adjustment also became clearer this week when big us investment merrill lynch revealed a $ 8bn loss on its sub-prime lending portfolio .
and earlier this week the head of the iif international bankers ' association , josef ackermannl , also the boss of deutsche bank , said that banks will have to take their losses - but that their underlying profits were strong enough to stand the strain .
slowing economy mr steel said that the us economy was still showing underlying strength and the treasury was not worried about a recession .
but he accepted that the problems in the housing market would provide a " penalty to growth " .
" housing has been providing a headwind to the economy , and there is a penalty to growth from the current situation in housing , " he said .
the size of that penalty is still unclear .
both the imf and the us homebuilders association expect the us growth rate in the first half of the year to be cut in half , and the us federal reserve has reduced its economic forecast by three-quarters of a percentage point as a result of the housing slowdown .
next week it meets to decide us interest rates .
and many economists believe that the fate of the us economy is now as much in the hands of the fed as the treasury .

there has been speculation for some time that a secret deal may have been done between mr karadzic - the bosnian serb wartime leader - and us officials at the end of the bosnian war .
now the hague has asked prosecutors in serbia to examine the claims .
the bbc 's nick hawton investigates .
in a restaurant in belgrade , vladimir nadezdin greets me with a smile and offers me coffee .
mr holbrooke helped bring milosevic to the 1995 dayton talks a former senior official in the government of ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , he says he saw a document relating to the deal , signed by mr karadzic and the american negotiator , richard holbrooke .
" it was in 1995 , the meeting took place in the serbian presidency , " mr nadezdin tells me .
" the piece of paper was in a4 format with the official logo of the bosnian serb republic -lsb- republika srpska -rsb- and the president of the republic , " he says .
" the first point was about mr karadzic giving up his political functions , the second one was about his withdrawal from party functions .
" the third one was about the withdrawal from the public life , and the last one , which was the most important one , was that radovan karadzic would not be under the jurisdiction of the hague , " mr nadezdin says .
my father ... told us that he finally made a deal and that now he did n't have to be worried about the hague anymore daughter of radovan karadzic richard holbrooke was the chief us negotiator who , through a combination of cajoling and energetic shuttle diplomacy , helped bring the warring sides together to sign the dayton peace agreement in december 1995 , which ended the bosnian war .
he had a reputation for hard negotiating and not always using orthodox methods .
but the document that mr nadezdin describes has never been produced .
hague inquiry i travelled across the mountains and to the town of pale , where the bosnian serbs had their wartime headquarters .
i had arranged to meet radovan karadzic 's daughter in the jet set restaurant .
she described when her father allegedly told the family that he had made a deal .
vladimir nadezdin says he saw documentary evidence of a deal " my father called us , members of the family , in his office , late in the evening , i think it was 18 july 1996 , and told us that he finally made a deal and that now he did n't have to be worried about the hague anymore , " she says .
" my father is still keeping his part of the deal . "
supporters of radovan karadzic have said for a long time that a deal was done .
but now investigators at the hague tribunal have asked serbia 's chief war crimes prosecutor to investigate the allegations .
a spokeswoman for the hague prosecutor 's office said they did not want to leave " any stone unturned " in their hunt for mr karadzic .
a number of people have already been interviewed and others will follow .
the results of the inquiry will be made public .
but it is significant that the hague itself does not appear to be ruling out the possibility of a deal .
no smoking gun in a statement , richard holbrooke 's office described the allegations of a deal as an " outrageous lie " and said he was " astonished that people would believe a war criminal over the word of the united states or people who brought peace to the balkans " .
mr karadzic remains at large despite an international manhunt dejan anastasijevic , a senior journalist with belgrade 's vreme magazine who has spent more than a decade reporting on war crimes , says : " mr holbrooke was ready to promise anything to the players of the bosnian war , including karadzic and milosevic . "
" i believe he did calm their fears about the tribunal in many ways , but i find it very difficult to believe he left any paper trail or that there was a written agreement .
" maybe some kind of oral agreement was made .
milosevic had a very strong motive for showing this document while on trial in the hague , but he never mentioned any such agreement or contract - although he did want mr holbrooke to appear as a witness .
" but if this document existed i ca n't imagine milosevic did n't have a copy . "
the arguments over a document or a verbal agreement between american officials and mr karadzic are likely to continue .
there are alleged eyewitness accounts , but no smoking gun has been found .
radovan karadzic remains on the run and only perhaps when he emerges from the shadows will more be known .
but there seems little prospect of that happening anytime soon .

the release ends months of waiting for mac fans , after apple pushed back the launch to finish development on its much-hyped iphone .
early reviews for leopard have been positive with veteran technology writer walt mossberg calling it " evolutionary , not revolutionary " .
apple is hoping to build on recent strong sales of its mac computers .
in the last three months , apple sold 2.2 million macs , up 400,000 on its previous best quarter .
the company is touting leopard as a vista-beater , pointing to new features not found in the new operating system -lrb- os -rrb- from microsoft that drives many pcs .
apple says there are 300 new features in leopard , but some of them are minor tweaks to the previous os , called tiger , rather than fully-fledged tools or enhancements .
writing in the wall street journal , mossberg said : " i believe it builds on apple 's quality advantage over windows .
" in my view , leopard is better and faster than vista , with a set of new features that make macs even easier to use . "
' few disappointments ' in the new york times , technology columnist david pogue wrote : " happy surprises , and very few disappointments , lie around every corner . "
at the macliveexpo , being held in london , there was a mixed response from attendees on whether they would be rushing out to buy leopard on day one .
many of the delegates said they would wait for the operating system to " bed down " before they bought it .
" i never buy any operating system when it first comes out .
i normally wait until it has been out for six months or a year , " said david ramage , a mac user from luton .
he added : " tiger does what i need it to do right now .
i 've not seen anything in leopard to make me want to buy it immediately . "
leopard 's new spots time machine - automatic file back-up stacks - related files and folders grouped automatically spaces -keep separate desktops for different uses quick look - examines the contents of a file without having to open the related program coverflow finder - flick through files and folders like album art in itunes boot camp - run windows on a mac review : leopard 's new spots for developers , a new operating system means having to work to ensure their programs run smoothly on the new platform .
ben rudolph , director of communications at swsoft , makers of parallels , said leopard was a big step forward for apple and " would continue to drive sales of macs " .
parallels lets users run windows and linux alongside os x on a single apple machine .
mr rudolph said parallels would run smoothly under leopard , barring any last minute changes to the code released by apple .
" if that happens , we 'll release a free , automatic update to account for them very soon after leopard 's launch , " he said .
of the new features in leopard , mr rudolph said he was looking forward to being able to take advantage of his mac 's 64-bit architecture . "
vista has been quite a disappointment for many people and leopard could be the reason many people make the switch to macs " nik rawlinson , editor of macuser magazine the new os takes full advantage of the latest generation of chips inside apple machines , while running applications on older processors also .
" i 'm also looking forward to new user-experience features like stacks , which should help me organise my incredibly messy desktop , and spaces , which lets me cycle between different desktops . "
nik rawlinson , editor of macuser magazine , said many users would get leopard in its first few weeks on sale .
" when tiger was launched it earned apple $ 120m very quickly and all the expectations are that sales will be double that . "
he added : " vista has been quite a disappointment for many people and leopard could be the reason many people make the switch to macs . "
he said he felt leopard had enough new features to distinguish itself from microsoft 's vista .
" a lot of things that were previously only add-ons in the mac world , such as the apple tv interface , are now integrated into the os .
" that is competing directly with media center on windows pcs .
apple has seen that microsoft has moved forward in some areas and is responding . "
a review and video overview of leopard will be published on the bbc news website on monday .

the release ends months of waiting for mac fans , after apple pushed back the launch to finish development on its much-hyped iphone .
early reviews for leopard have been positive with veteran technology writer walt mossberg calling it " evolutionary , not revolutionary " .
apple is hoping to build on recent strong sales of its mac computers .
in the last three months , apple sold 2.2 million macs , up 400,000 on its previous best quarter .
the company is touting leopard as a vista-beater , pointing to new features not found in the new operating system -lrb- os -rrb- from microsoft that drives many pcs .
apple says there are 300 new features in leopard , but some of them are minor tweaks to the previous os , called tiger , rather than fully-fledged tools or enhancements .
leopard comes in one flavour for all users writing in the wall street journal , mossberg said : " i believe it builds on apple 's quality advantage over windows .
" in my view , leopard is better and faster than vista , with a set of new features that make macs even easier to use . "
' few disappointments ' in the new york times , technology columnist david pogue wrote : " happy surprises , and very few disappointments , lie around every corner . "
at the macliveexpo , being held in london , there was a mixed response from attendees on whether they would be rushing out to buy leopard on day one .
many of the delegates said they would wait for the operating system to " bed down " before they bought it .
" i never buy any operating system when it first comes out .
i normally wait until it has been out for six months or a year , " said david ramage , a mac user from luton .
he added : " tiger does what i need it to do right now .
i 've not seen anything in leopard to make me want to buy it immediately . "
leopard 's new spots time machine - automatic file back-up stacks - related files and folders grouped automatically spaces -keep separate desktops for different uses quick look - examines the contents of a file without having to open the related program coverflow finder - flick through files and folders like album art in itunes boot camp - run windows on a mac review : leopard 's new spots for developers , a new operating system means having to work to ensure their programs run smoothly on the new platform .
ben rudolph , director of communications at swsoft , makers of parallels , said leopard was a big step forward for apple and " would continue to drive sales of macs " .
parallels lets users run windows and linux alongside os x on a single apple machine .
mr rudolph said parallels would run smoothly under leopard , barring any last minute changes to the code released by apple .
" if that happens , we 'll release a free , automatic update to account for them very soon after leopard 's launch , " he said .
of the new features in leopard , mr rudolph said he was looking forward to being able to take advantage of his mac 's 64-bit architecture .
vista has been quite a disappointment for many people and leopard could be the reason many people make the switch to macs nik rawlinson , editor of macuser magazine the new os takes full advantage of the latest generation of chips inside apple machines , while running applications on older processors also .
" i 'm also looking forward to new user-experience features like stacks , which should help me organise my incredibly messy desktop , and spaces , which lets me cycle between different desktops . "
nik rawlinson , editor of macuser magazine , said many users would get leopard in its first few weeks on sale .
" when tiger was launched it earned apple $ 120m very quickly and all the expectations are that sales will be double that . "
features like stacks gathers related material together he added : " vista has been quite a disappointment for many people and leopard could be the reason many people make the switch to macs . "
he said he felt leopard had enough new features to distinguish itself from microsoft 's vista .
" a lot of things that were previously only add-ons in the mac world , such as the apple tv interface , are now integrated into the os .
" that is competing directly with media center on windows pcs .
apple has seen that microsoft has moved forward in some areas and is responding . "

a legal expert has claimed the assembly government could start the process to make smacking a criminal offence .
some children 's charities have welcomed the prospect , saying a ban would clarify a confusing issue for parents .
but family and youth concern said it was wrong to pass laws on how parents should bring up children .
norman wells , from family and youth concern , which researches the effects of family breakdown , said : " nobody has got a right to come along and tell you to eat up your greens , or tell you what time to go to bed . "
if there were a ban on smacking , it would very clearly say that violence - all violence - against children is unacceptable " lynne hill , children in wales " but you do have that sort of right and power with a child who is your responsibility .
" parents stand in a unique relationship to their children , and along with that unique relationship and that unique responsibility , comes unique authority , " he added .
lynne hill from the charity children in wales said it would be disappointed if a proposal from the assembly government was blocked at westminster .
she said : " if there were a ban on smacking , it would very clearly say that violence - all violence - against children is unacceptable .
" i think the issue at the moment is that parents are unclear where they stand in terms of they want to work towards positive parenting , towards non-violent parenting , but the law does n't give them that clear line . "
" if you 're asking if i personally would like the assembly to have this competence , then the answer certainly is yes " welsh assembly government deputy health minister gwenda thomas on thursday , kevin brennan , the mp for cardiff west and the children 's minister in the uk government , said there were no plans to change the existing laws on child smacking .
under the 2004 children 's act , which came into force in january 2005 mild smacking is allowed but any punishment which causes visible bruising , grazes , scratches , minor swellings or cuts can result in action .
former government legal adviser professor david lambert said a request for the right to legislate - known as a legislative competence order -lrb- lco -rrb- - proposed by the assembly government on vulnerable children - was so broad it could be an enabling power for the assembly to ban smacking .
legal position " the only way to challenge it then would be through the courts , " he added .
the labour-plaid coalition government made it clear that , if it had the right to legislate , it would use it to ban smacking .
the wales office said discussions were underway in the assembly government on the vulnerable children lco , but said it had not been submitted yet .
deputy health minister gwenda thomas told a committee of ams that she was in favour of wales having its own law .
she said : " i am unable to confirm the legal position , but i will undertake to write to the committee to provide clarity as soon as i 'm able .
" if you 're asking if i personally would like the assembly to have this competence , then the answer certainly is yes . "

a legal expert has claimed the assembly government could start the process to make smacking a criminal offence .
some children 's charities have welcomed the prospect , saying a ban would clarify a confusing issue for parents .
but family and youth concern said it was wrong to pass laws on how parents should bring up children .
norman wells , from family and youth concern , which researches the effects of family breakdown , said : " nobody has got a right to come along and tell you to eat up your greens , or tell you what time to go to bed .
if there were a ban on smacking , it would very clearly say that violence - all violence - against children is unacceptable lynne hill , children in wales " but you do have that sort of right and power with a child who is your responsibility .
" parents stand in a unique relationship to their children , and along with that unique relationship and that unique responsibility , comes unique authority , " he added .
lynne hill from the charity children in wales said it would be disappointed if a proposal from the assembly government was blocked at westminster .
she said : " if there were a ban on smacking , it would very clearly say that violence - all violence - against children is unacceptable .
" i think the issue at the moment is that parents are unclear where they stand in terms of they want to work towards positive parenting , towards non-violent parenting , but the law does n't give them that clear line . "
if you 're asking if i personally would like the assembly to have this competence , then the answer certainly is yes welsh assembly government deputy health minister gwenda thomas on thursday , kevin brennan , the mp for cardiff west and the children 's minister in the uk government , said there were no plans to change the existing laws on child smacking .
under the 2004 children 's act , which came into force in january 2005 mild smacking is allowed but any punishment which causes visible bruising , grazes , scratches , minor swellings or cuts can result in action .
former government legal adviser professor david lambert said a request for the right to legislate - known as a legislative competence order -lrb- lco -rrb- - proposed by the assembly government on vulnerable children - was so broad it could be an enabling power for the assembly to ban smacking .
legal position " the only way to challenge it then would be through the courts , " he added .
the labour-plaid coalition government made it clear that , if it had the right to legislate , it would use it to ban smacking .
the wales office said discussions were underway in the assembly government on the vulnerable children lco , but said it had not been submitted yet .
deputy health minister gwenda thomas told a committee of ams that she was in favour of wales having its own law .
she said : " i am unable to confirm the legal position , but i will undertake to write to the committee to provide clarity as soon as i 'm able .

but the 25-year-old singer is still facing a charge of driving without a valid licence .
ms spears ' lawyer entered a not guilty plea on her behalf , and a further hearing was set for 26 november .
she allegedly crashed into the parked car in full view of photographers , before leaving the scene on 6 august .
the owner of the car filed an accident report on 9 august at a police station in north hollywood .
ms spears ' lawyer michael flanagan said that the owner of the car that was hit was satisfied with the resolution and did not want to go forward with the hit-and-run charge .
' satisfied ' speaking outside the court , mr flanagan said assistant city attorney michael amerian had offered the singer a plea deal on the licence charge which would have resulted in her being placed on probation for a year .
but mr flanagan said he believed a plea was unnecessary because ms spears had rectified the situation by recently getting a california driving licence .
he added that the singer had a licence in louisiana , but she had not been able to obtain one in california because a camera was not available when she applied for one .
meanwhile , a court hearing in ms spears ' custody fight with former husband kevin federline over their two young sons is scheduled for friday .
