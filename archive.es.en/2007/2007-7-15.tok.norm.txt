the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .
frattini is determined to build up the frontex operation , announcing that the patrols will become a permanent presence in the mediterranean from january . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .

they see the project as a chance to work on a " new libya . " " this is a coup , " said siegfried wernik from the firm leon wohlhage wernik , whose resume includes the indian embassy in berlin , bremen 's representation in the capital and the schwabengalerie mall in stuttgart .
" the opportunity to design such an extraordinary project is a privilege and a challenge .

the project will be partially completed by 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of libyan leader moammar gadhafi taking power , but will most probably only be fully completed in 2017 . the cost will be between 2.5 billion and three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion and 4.1 billion -rrb- . following in the footsteps of niemeyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally , oscar niemeyer put brasília on the map a model of the design posted on the company 's website shows flat-roofed ministries lining a large rectangular park dotted with palm trees . the complex has already been compared by the german press to the futuristic , utopian architectural style famously employed in the brazilian capital brasilia in the 1950s by architect oscar niemeyer . it will be situated between tripoli 's international airport and the capital 's historical center and will also include a mosque , a towering five-star hotel and a conference center . new headquarters , new libya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close-up of one of the planned government buildings the firm said it tried to combine tradition and modernity in the design to show that " after years of isolation and conflict with the west , libya now stands at a crossroads between the past and the future .

" we have done out homework on libya , " he said .
" people think of it as a dictatorship , but the country wants to be taken back into the international fold . " our impression is that the new government seat represents a new libya , " he added .
" for us , that was reason enough to get involved . " german architecture in international demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " tripoli greens " building is also part of the proposed new government center the success of the berlin team reflects the broad international popularity of german architects , who are increasingly highly sought after the world over .

the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .

the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .

he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .

" we 're disappointed russia has suspended its participation for now , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement .
" but we 'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area , that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in europe , " he added .
the kremlin announced saturday that president vladimir putin had signed a decree suspending russia 's application of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .
russia had threatened several times to pull out of the treaty amid unease over us military encroachment into territory once part of the former soviet union .
moscow particularly objected to us plans to place elements of a missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic .
the us state department said it was " disappointed " by russia 's announcement .
washington " remains committed to cfe 's full implementation ... -lsb- and looks -rsb- forward to continuing to engage with russia and other parties to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 cfe states , " a statement said .
nato laments a " step back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato considers the treaty to be the bedrock of security nato spokesman james appathurai also expressed disappointment .
" it 's a disappointing move , a step backwards .
nato considers this treaty to be an important foundation of european security and stability , " he said .
the osce expressed its concern through spain , which currently holds the presidency of the 56-member organization .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos called on all signatory states " to renew their efforts to examine the underlying difficulties swiftly and earnestly and work together to overcome them . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile expressed his " great concern . "
speaking in lithuania during a tour of the baltic countries , he said the treaty was a central element in the international architecture of disarmament .
" that is why we obviously regard moscow 's announcement with great concern . "
" in the next few days we will see what concrete measures will be taken because of this announcement , " he said , adding that he hoped russia would go no further than suspend the treaty .
poles see no immediate consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could be one of the main site in the us missile shield polish foreign ministry spokesman robert szaniawski said warsaw regretted the decision .
but he added : " taking previous announcements into account , this decision is not a surprise and does n't have immediate consequences . "
warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .
romania 's foreign ministry also expressed its " disappointment . "
" romania considers that the cfe treaty represents a basis for european security , " the ministry said , adding that it hoped " that dialogue between the states participating in the cfe treaty will be maintained and that all of the states will continue to respect their obligations within the framework of the treaty . "
finnish defense minister jyri hakamies sunday said the decision was negative from a finnish point of view .
in remarks to finnish broadcaster yle , hakamies said tension between the major powers was never good but added the announcement by moscow should not be over-emphasized .
in oslo , norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store saturday expressed " regret " over the announcement by moscow .
in a statement , store said the cfe treaty " has been an important instrument that has contributed to security and stability in europe since it came into force in 1992 . "
norway is a member of nato .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , currently on holiday , was quoted as saying that the consequences of the russian announcement needed to be analyzed but could impact the mutual information and inspection system .
gorbachev suggests move is to " spark dialogue " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev believes the us and nato forced russia 's hand meanwhile former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday that russia 's decision was taken in order to spark dialogue .
" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .

" we 're disappointed russia has suspended its participation for now , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement .
" but we 'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area , that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in europe , " he added .
the kremlin announced saturday that president vladimir putin had signed a decree suspending russia 's application of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .
russia had threatened several times to pull out of the treaty amid unease over us military encroachment into territory once part of the former soviet union .
moscow particularly objected to us plans to place elements of a missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic .
the us state department said it was " disappointed " by russia 's announcement .
washington " remains committed to cfe 's full implementation ... -lsb- and looks -rsb- forward to continuing to engage with russia and other parties to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 cfe states , " a statement said .
nato laments a " step back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato considers the treaty to be the bedrock of security nato spokesman james appathurai also expressed disappointment .

nato considers this treaty to be an important foundation of european security and stability , " he said .
the osce expressed its concern through spain , which currently holds the presidency of the 56-member organization .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos called on all signatory states " to renew their efforts to examine the underlying difficulties swiftly and earnestly and work together to overcome them . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile expressed his " great concern . "
speaking in lithuania during a tour of the baltic countries , he said the treaty was a central element in the international architecture of disarmament .
" that is why we obviously regard moscow 's announcement with great concern . "
" in the next few days we will see what concrete measures will be taken because of this announcement , " he said , adding that he hoped russia would go no further than suspend the treaty .
poles see no immediate consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could be one of the main site in the us missile shield polish foreign ministry spokesman robert szaniawski said warsaw regretted the decision .
but he added : " taking previous announcements into account , this decision is not a surprise and does n't have immediate consequences . "
warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .
romania 's foreign ministry also expressed its " disappointment . "
" romania considers that the cfe treaty represents a basis for european security , " the ministry said , adding that it hoped " that dialogue between the states participating in the cfe treaty will be maintained and that all of the states will continue to respect their obligations within the framework of the treaty . "
finnish defense minister jyri hakamies sunday said the decision was negative from a finnish point of view .
in remarks to finnish broadcaster yle , hakamies said tension between the major powers was never good but added the announcement by moscow should not be over-emphasized .
in oslo , norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store saturday expressed " regret " over the announcement by moscow .
in a statement , store said the cfe treaty " has been an important instrument that has contributed to security and stability in europe since it came into force in 1992 . "
norway is a member of nato .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , currently on holiday , was quoted as saying that the consequences of the russian announcement needed to be analyzed but could impact the mutual information and inspection system .
gorbachev suggests move is to " spark dialogue " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev believes the us and nato forced russia 's hand meanwhile former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday that russia 's decision was taken in order to spark dialogue .
" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .
the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .

spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos called on all signatory states " to renew their efforts to examine the underlying difficulties swiftly and earnestly and work together to overcome them . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile expressed his " great concern . "
speaking in lithuania during a tour of the baltic countries , he said the treaty was a central element in the international architecture of disarmament .
" that is why we obviously regard moscow 's announcement with great concern . "
" in the next few days we will see what concrete measures will be taken because of this announcement , " he said , adding that he hoped russia would go no further than suspend the treaty .
poles see no immediate consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could be one of the main site in the us missile shield polish foreign ministry spokesman robert szaniawski said warsaw regretted the decision .
but he added : " taking previous announcements into account , this decision is not a surprise and does n't have immediate consequences . "
warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .
romania 's foreign ministry also expressed its " disappointment . "
" romania considers that the cfe treaty represents a basis for european security , " the ministry said , adding that it hoped " that dialogue between the states participating in the cfe treaty will be maintained and that all of the states will continue to respect their obligations within the framework of the treaty . "
finnish defense minister jyri hakamies sunday said the decision was negative from a finnish point of view .
in remarks to finnish broadcaster yle , hakamies said tension between the major powers was never good but added the announcement by moscow should not be over-emphasized .
in oslo , norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store saturday expressed " regret " over the announcement by moscow .
in a statement , store said the cfe treaty " has been an important instrument that has contributed to security and stability in europe since it came into force in 1992 . "
norway is a member of nato .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , currently on holiday , was quoted as saying that the consequences of the russian announcement needed to be analyzed but could impact the mutual information and inspection system .
gorbachev suggests move is to " spark dialogue " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev believes the us and nato forced russia 's hand meanwhile former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday that russia 's decision was taken in order to spark dialogue .
" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .
the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .
" it would have been completely incomprehensible if russia was to continue fulfilling the treaty when the other sides had not even ratified it , " said gorbachev . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .

a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're disappointed russia has suspended its participation for now , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement .
" but we 'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area , that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in europe , " he added .
the kremlin announced saturday that president vladimir putin had signed a decree suspending russia 's application of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .
russia had threatened several times to pull out of the treaty amid unease over us military encroachment into territory once part of the former soviet union .
moscow particularly objected to us plans to place elements of a missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic .
the us state department said it was " disappointed " by russia 's announcement .
washington " remains committed to cfe 's full implementation ... -lsb- and looks -rsb- forward to continuing to engage with russia and other parties to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 cfe states , " a statement said .
nato laments a " step back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato considers the treaty to be the bedrock of security nato spokesman james appathurai also expressed disappointment .
" it 's a disappointing move , a step backwards .
nato considers this treaty to be an important foundation of european security and stability , " he said .
the osce expressed its concern through spain , which currently holds the presidency of the 56-member organization .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos called on all signatory states " to renew their efforts to examine the underlying difficulties swiftly and earnestly and work together to overcome them . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile expressed his " great concern . "
speaking in lithuania during a tour of the baltic countries , he said the treaty was a central element in the international architecture of disarmament .
" that is why we obviously regard moscow 's announcement with great concern . "
" in the next few days we will see what concrete measures will be taken because of this announcement , " he said , adding that he hoped russia would go no further than suspend the treaty .
poles see no immediate consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could be one of the main site in the us missile shield polish foreign ministry spokesman robert szaniawski said warsaw regretted the decision .
but he added : " taking previous announcements into account , this decision is not a surprise and does n't have immediate consequences . "
warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .
romania 's foreign ministry also expressed its " disappointment . "
" romania considers that the cfe treaty represents a basis for european security , " the ministry said , adding that it hoped " that dialogue between the states participating in the cfe treaty will be maintained and that all of the states will continue to respect their obligations within the framework of the treaty . "
finnish defense minister jyri hakamies sunday said the decision was negative from a finnish point of view .
in remarks to finnish broadcaster yle , hakamies said tension between the major powers was never good but added the announcement by moscow should not be over-emphasized .
in oslo , norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store saturday expressed " regret " over the announcement by moscow .
in a statement , store said the cfe treaty " has been an important instrument that has contributed to security and stability in europe since it came into force in 1992 . "
norway is a member of nato .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , currently on holiday , was quoted as saying that the consequences of the russian announcement needed to be analyzed but could impact the mutual information and inspection system .
gorbachev suggests move is to " spark dialogue " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev believes the us and nato forced russia 's hand meanwhile former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday that russia 's decision was taken in order to spark dialogue .
" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .
the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .
" it would have been completely incomprehensible if russia was to continue fulfilling the treaty when the other sides had not even ratified it , " said gorbachev . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they see the project as a chance to work on a " new libya . " " this is a coup , " said siegfried wernik from the firm leon wohlhage wernik , whose resume includes the indian embassy in berlin , bremen 's representation in the capital and the schwabengalerie mall in stuttgart .
" the opportunity to design such an extraordinary project is a privilege and a challenge .

the project will be partially completed by 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of libyan leader moammar gadhafi taking power , but will most probably only be fully completed in 2017 . the cost will be between 2.5 billion and three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion and 4.1 billion -rrb- . following in the footsteps of niemeyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally , oscar niemeyer put brasília on the map a model of the design posted on the company 's website shows flat-roofed ministries lining a large rectangular park dotted with palm trees . the complex has already been compared by the german press to the futuristic , utopian architectural style famously employed in the brazilian capital brasilia in the 1950s by architect oscar niemeyer . it will be situated between tripoli 's international airport and the capital 's historical center and will also include a mosque , a towering five-star hotel and a conference center . new headquarters , new libya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close-up of one of the planned government buildings the firm said it tried to combine tradition and modernity in the design to show that " after years of isolation and conflict with the west , libya now stands at a crossroads between the past and the future .

" we have done out homework on libya , " he said .
" people think of it as a dictatorship , but the country wants to be taken back into the international fold . " our impression is that the new government seat represents a new libya , " he added .

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .

some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .

" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .

a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .

it was the duty of the minister " to wrack his brains " over the best way to protect citizens , the president said in an interview on germany 's second television channel zdf .
but the staccato " manner in which the suggestions came about " was not ideal .
schäuble called for legal powers to intern terrorist " combatants " before they struck and said that germany might have to introduce a us-style criminal offence of conspiracy to commit a crime .
the minister , who outlined his thoughts in the news magazine der spiegel last week , also proposed a ban on the use of the internet and mobile phones by people the state deemed to be dangerous .
schäuble calls for clarification on targeted killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler urged schäuble to think before speaking schäuble also called for clarification under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
president köhler said he had his doubts whether " the killing of a suspected terrorist without a court ruling could be treated so lightly . "
the minister 's remarks , particularly those about targeted assassinations , provoked outrage in germany , with opposition greens party leader claudia roth calling on him to resign .
schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , defended his views , saying : " you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing either . "
but the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have been in a power-sharing government with the cdu since november 2005 , warned that the minister 's remarks could threaten the continuation of the coalition .
critics call for interior minister to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : " schäuble 's protecting freedom to death " " the grand coalition can not put up for ever with schäuble is doing , " said ralf stegner , spd interior minister in the northern state of schleswig holstein .
" frau merkel has to tell him , ' enough is enough ' , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
spd chairman kurt beck accused schäuble of being excessive and losing sight of his goals .
" his proposals far surpass the current constitutional consensus .
he wants to protect freedom to death , " beck told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
schäuble 's proposals came in the wake of the failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow .
germany had a similar scare in july last year when authorities defused two suitcase bombs islamic militants placed on trains . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .
frattini is determined to build up the frontex operation , announcing that the patrols will become a permanent presence in the mediterranean from january . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they see the project as a chance to work on a " new libya . " " this is a coup , " said siegfried wernik from the firm leon wohlhage wernik , whose resume includes the indian embassy in berlin , bremen 's representation in the capital and the schwabengalerie mall in stuttgart .
" the opportunity to design such an extraordinary project is a privilege and a challenge .

the project will be partially completed by 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of libyan leader moammar gadhafi taking power , but will most probably only be fully completed in 2017 . the cost will be between 2.5 billion and three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion and 4.1 billion -rrb- . following in the footsteps of niemeyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally , oscar niemeyer put brasília on the map a model of the design posted on the company 's website shows flat-roofed ministries lining a large rectangular park dotted with palm trees . the complex has already been compared by the german press to the futuristic , utopian architectural style famously employed in the brazilian capital brasilia in the 1950s by architect oscar niemeyer . it will be situated between tripoli 's international airport and the capital 's historical center and will also include a mosque , a towering five-star hotel and a conference center . new headquarters , new libya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close-up of one of the planned government buildings the firm said it tried to combine tradition and modernity in the design to show that " after years of isolation and conflict with the west , libya now stands at a crossroads between the past and the future . " long considered a pariah state , libya changed tack in 2004 when it renounced its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction wernik told the daily berliner zeitung that leon wohlhage wernik sought advice from two experts on islam , who filled them in on current political developments in the country many in germany still associate first and foremost with terrorist attacks on a berlin discotheque in 1986 . " we have done out homework on libya , " he said .
" people think of it as a dictatorship , but the country wants to be taken back into the international fold . " our impression is that the new government seat represents a new libya , " he added .
" for us , that was reason enough to get involved . " german architecture in international demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " tripoli greens " building is also part of the proposed new government center the success of the berlin team reflects the broad international popularity of german architects , who are increasingly highly sought after the world over .

it was the duty of the minister " to wrack his brains " over the best way to protect citizens , the president said in an interview on germany 's second television channel zdf .
but the staccato " manner in which the suggestions came about " was not ideal .
schäuble called for legal powers to intern terrorist " combatants " before they struck and said that germany might have to introduce a us-style criminal offence of conspiracy to commit a crime .
the minister , who outlined his thoughts in the news magazine der spiegel last week , also proposed a ban on the use of the internet and mobile phones by people the state deemed to be dangerous .
schäuble calls for clarification on targeted killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler urged schäuble to think before speaking schäuble also called for clarification under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
president köhler said he had his doubts whether " the killing of a suspected terrorist without a court ruling could be treated so lightly . "
the minister 's remarks , particularly those about targeted assassinations , provoked outrage in germany , with opposition greens party leader claudia roth calling on him to resign .
schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , defended his views , saying : " you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing either . "
but the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have been in a power-sharing government with the cdu since november 2005 , warned that the minister 's remarks could threaten the continuation of the coalition .
critics call for interior minister to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : " schäuble 's protecting freedom to death " " the grand coalition can not put up for ever with schäuble is doing , " said ralf stegner , spd interior minister in the northern state of schleswig holstein .
" frau merkel has to tell him , ' enough is enough ' , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
spd chairman kurt beck accused schäuble of being excessive and losing sight of his goals .
" his proposals far surpass the current constitutional consensus .
he wants to protect freedom to death , " beck told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
schäuble 's proposals came in the wake of the failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow .
germany had a similar scare in july last year when authorities defused two suitcase bombs islamic militants placed on trains . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

it was the duty of the minister " to wrack his brains " over the best way to protect citizens , the president said in an interview on germany 's second television channel zdf .
but the staccato " manner in which the suggestions came about " was not ideal .
schäuble called for legal powers to intern terrorist " combatants " before they struck and said that germany might have to introduce a us-style criminal offence of conspiracy to commit a crime .
the minister , who outlined his thoughts in the news magazine der spiegel last week , also proposed a ban on the use of the internet and mobile phones by people the state deemed to be dangerous .
schäuble calls for clarification on targeted killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler urged schäuble to think before speaking schäuble also called for clarification under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
president köhler said he had his doubts whether " the killing of a suspected terrorist without a court ruling could be treated so lightly . "
the minister 's remarks , particularly those about targeted assassinations , provoked outrage in germany , with opposition greens party leader claudia roth calling on him to resign .
schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , defended his views , saying : " you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing either . "
but the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have been in a power-sharing government with the cdu since november 2005 , warned that the minister 's remarks could threaten the continuation of the coalition .
critics call for interior minister to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : " schäuble 's protecting freedom to death " " the grand coalition can not put up for ever with schäuble is doing , " said ralf stegner , spd interior minister in the northern state of schleswig holstein .
" frau merkel has to tell him , ' enough is enough ' , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
spd chairman kurt beck accused schäuble of being excessive and losing sight of his goals .
" his proposals far surpass the current constitutional consensus .
he wants to protect freedom to death , " beck told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
schäuble 's proposals came in the wake of the failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow .

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the duty of the minister " to wrack his brains " over the best way to protect citizens , the president said in an interview on germany 's second television channel zdf .
but the staccato " manner in which the suggestions came about " was not ideal .
schäuble called for legal powers to intern terrorist " combatants " before they struck and said that germany might have to introduce a us-style criminal offence of conspiracy to commit a crime .
the minister , who outlined his thoughts in the news magazine der spiegel last week , also proposed a ban on the use of the internet and mobile phones by people the state deemed to be dangerous .
schäuble calls for clarification on targeted killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler urged schäuble to think before speaking schäuble also called for clarification under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
president köhler said he had his doubts whether " the killing of a suspected terrorist without a court ruling could be treated so lightly . "
the minister 's remarks , particularly those about targeted assassinations , provoked outrage in germany , with opposition greens party leader claudia roth calling on him to resign .
schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , defended his views , saying : " you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing either . "
but the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have been in a power-sharing government with the cdu since november 2005 , warned that the minister 's remarks could threaten the continuation of the coalition .
critics call for interior minister to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : " schäuble 's protecting freedom to death " " the grand coalition can not put up for ever with schäuble is doing , " said ralf stegner , spd interior minister in the northern state of schleswig holstein .
" frau merkel has to tell him , ' enough is enough ' , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
spd chairman kurt beck accused schäuble of being excessive and losing sight of his goals .
" his proposals far surpass the current constitutional consensus .
he wants to protect freedom to death , " beck told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
schäuble 's proposals came in the wake of the failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow .
germany had a similar scare in july last year when authorities defused two suitcase bombs islamic militants placed on trains . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .
the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 15.07.2007 eu 's border agency frontex : a net with a gaping hole ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many illegal immigrants are sent back home europe has a major influx of illegal immigrants every year , while many also die while making the journey from the african continent .
the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .
frattini is determined to build up the frontex operation , announcing that the patrols will become a permanent presence in the mediterranean from january . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the duty of the minister " to wrack his brains " over the best way to protect citizens , the president said in an interview on germany 's second television channel zdf .
but the staccato " manner in which the suggestions came about " was not ideal .
schäuble called for legal powers to intern terrorist " combatants " before they struck and said that germany might have to introduce a us-style criminal offence of conspiracy to commit a crime .
the minister , who outlined his thoughts in the news magazine der spiegel last week , also proposed a ban on the use of the internet and mobile phones by people the state deemed to be dangerous .
schäuble calls for clarification on targeted killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler urged schäuble to think before speaking schäuble also called for clarification under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
president köhler said he had his doubts whether " the killing of a suspected terrorist without a court ruling could be treated so lightly . "
the minister 's remarks , particularly those about targeted assassinations , provoked outrage in germany , with opposition greens party leader claudia roth calling on him to resign .
schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , defended his views , saying : " you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing either . "
but the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have been in a power-sharing government with the cdu since november 2005 , warned that the minister 's remarks could threaten the continuation of the coalition .
critics call for interior minister to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : " schäuble 's protecting freedom to death " " the grand coalition can not put up for ever with schäuble is doing , " said ralf stegner , spd interior minister in the northern state of schleswig holstein .
" frau merkel has to tell him , ' enough is enough ' , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
spd chairman kurt beck accused schäuble of being excessive and losing sight of his goals .
" his proposals far surpass the current constitutional consensus .
he wants to protect freedom to death , " beck told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
schäuble 's proposals came in the wake of the failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow .

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .

apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

they see the project as a chance to work on a " new libya . " " this is a coup , " said siegfried wernik from the firm leon wohlhage wernik , whose resume includes the indian embassy in berlin , bremen 's representation in the capital and the schwabengalerie mall in stuttgart .
" the opportunity to design such an extraordinary project is a privilege and a challenge . " the winning team 's design outstripped some prestigious competition , chosen over others submitted by acclaimed iraqi architect zaha hadid , japan 's kisho kurokawa and hamburg-based architects gerkan marg und partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moammar gadhafi looks to the future according to the berliners ' plans , the new government buildings will extend across 230 hectares -lrb- 568 acres -rrb- - an area as large as some 350 soccer pitches .
the project will be partially completed by 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of libyan leader moammar gadhafi taking power , but will most probably only be fully completed in 2017 . the cost will be between 2.5 billion and three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion and 4.1 billion -rrb- . following in the footsteps of niemeyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally , oscar niemeyer put brasília on the map a model of the design posted on the company 's website shows flat-roofed ministries lining a large rectangular park dotted with palm trees . the complex has already been compared by the german press to the futuristic , utopian architectural style famously employed in the brazilian capital brasilia in the 1950s by architect oscar niemeyer . it will be situated between tripoli 's international airport and the capital 's historical center and will also include a mosque , a towering five-star hotel and a conference center . new headquarters , new libya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close-up of one of the planned government buildings the firm said it tried to combine tradition and modernity in the design to show that " after years of isolation and conflict with the west , libya now stands at a crossroads between the past and the future . " long considered a pariah state , libya changed tack in 2004 when it renounced its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction wernik told the daily berliner zeitung that leon wohlhage wernik sought advice from two experts on islam , who filled them in on current political developments in the country many in germany still associate first and foremost with terrorist attacks on a berlin discotheque in 1986 . " we have done out homework on libya , " he said .
" people think of it as a dictatorship , but the country wants to be taken back into the international fold . " our impression is that the new government seat represents a new libya , " he added .
" for us , that was reason enough to get involved . " german architecture in international demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " tripoli greens " building is also part of the proposed new government center the success of the berlin team reflects the broad international popularity of german architects , who are increasingly highly sought after the world over .
from china to russia and various arab states , germans have a reputation as skilled all-rounders , able to oversee projects from design to follow-through . berlin-based architects have a particular advantage .
in the years since german reunification , the city has been completely revamped and serves as an international calling card for local architectural offices . bildunterschrift : the " new libya " is expected to be finished by 2017 " berlin 's architecture is great publicity , " said klaus meier-hartmann , president of the berlin architects ' chamber , in the berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're disappointed russia has suspended its participation for now , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement .
" but we 'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area , that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in europe , " he added .
the kremlin announced saturday that president vladimir putin had signed a decree suspending russia 's application of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .
russia had threatened several times to pull out of the treaty amid unease over us military encroachment into territory once part of the former soviet union .
moscow particularly objected to us plans to place elements of a missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic .
the us state department said it was " disappointed " by russia 's announcement .
washington " remains committed to cfe 's full implementation ... -lsb- and looks -rsb- forward to continuing to engage with russia and other parties to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 cfe states , " a statement said .

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're disappointed russia has suspended its participation for now , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement .
" but we 'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area , that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in europe , " he added .
the kremlin announced saturday that president vladimir putin had signed a decree suspending russia 's application of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .
russia had threatened several times to pull out of the treaty amid unease over us military encroachment into territory once part of the former soviet union .
moscow particularly objected to us plans to place elements of a missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic .
the us state department said it was " disappointed " by russia 's announcement .
washington " remains committed to cfe 's full implementation ... -lsb- and looks -rsb- forward to continuing to engage with russia and other parties to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 cfe states , " a statement said .
nato laments a " step back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato considers the treaty to be the bedrock of security nato spokesman james appathurai also expressed disappointment .
" it 's a disappointing move , a step backwards .
nato considers this treaty to be an important foundation of european security and stability , " he said .
the osce expressed its concern through spain , which currently holds the presidency of the 56-member organization .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos called on all signatory states " to renew their efforts to examine the underlying difficulties swiftly and earnestly and work together to overcome them . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile expressed his " great concern . "
speaking in lithuania during a tour of the baltic countries , he said the treaty was a central element in the international architecture of disarmament .
" that is why we obviously regard moscow 's announcement with great concern . "
" in the next few days we will see what concrete measures will be taken because of this announcement , " he said , adding that he hoped russia would go no further than suspend the treaty .
poles see no immediate consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could be one of the main site in the us missile shield polish foreign ministry spokesman robert szaniawski said warsaw regretted the decision .
but he added : " taking previous announcements into account , this decision is not a surprise and does n't have immediate consequences . "
warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .
romania 's foreign ministry also expressed its " disappointment . "
" romania considers that the cfe treaty represents a basis for european security , " the ministry said , adding that it hoped " that dialogue between the states participating in the cfe treaty will be maintained and that all of the states will continue to respect their obligations within the framework of the treaty . "
finnish defense minister jyri hakamies sunday said the decision was negative from a finnish point of view .
in remarks to finnish broadcaster yle , hakamies said tension between the major powers was never good but added the announcement by moscow should not be over-emphasized .
in oslo , norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store saturday expressed " regret " over the announcement by moscow .
in a statement , store said the cfe treaty " has been an important instrument that has contributed to security and stability in europe since it came into force in 1992 . "
norway is a member of nato .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , currently on holiday , was quoted as saying that the consequences of the russian announcement needed to be analyzed but could impact the mutual information and inspection system .
gorbachev suggests move is to " spark dialogue " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev believes the us and nato forced russia 's hand meanwhile former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday that russia 's decision was taken in order to spark dialogue .
" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .
the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .
" it would have been completely incomprehensible if russia was to continue fulfilling the treaty when the other sides had not even ratified it , " said gorbachev . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the duty of the minister " to wrack his brains " over the best way to protect citizens , the president said in an interview on germany 's second television channel zdf .
but the staccato " manner in which the suggestions came about " was not ideal .
schäuble called for legal powers to intern terrorist " combatants " before they struck and said that germany might have to introduce a us-style criminal offence of conspiracy to commit a crime .
the minister , who outlined his thoughts in the news magazine der spiegel last week , also proposed a ban on the use of the internet and mobile phones by people the state deemed to be dangerous .
schäuble calls for clarification on targeted killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler urged schäuble to think before speaking schäuble also called for clarification under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
president köhler said he had his doubts whether " the killing of a suspected terrorist without a court ruling could be treated so lightly . "
the minister 's remarks , particularly those about targeted assassinations , provoked outrage in germany , with opposition greens party leader claudia roth calling on him to resign .
schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , defended his views , saying : " you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing either . "
but the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have been in a power-sharing government with the cdu since november 2005 , warned that the minister 's remarks could threaten the continuation of the coalition .

" frau merkel has to tell him , ' enough is enough ' , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
spd chairman kurt beck accused schäuble of being excessive and losing sight of his goals .
" his proposals far surpass the current constitutional consensus .
he wants to protect freedom to death , " beck told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
schäuble 's proposals came in the wake of the failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow .

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .
frattini is determined to build up the frontex operation , announcing that the patrols will become a permanent presence in the mediterranean from january . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .

apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 15.07.2007 franco 's dictatorship still proves problematic for spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco 's dictatorship continues to divide spain much as it did during his reign the spanish government 's attempt to settle the nation 's accounts with the 1939-75 dictatorship of general francisco franco is at the risk of failing . a draft law aimed at rehabilitating the memory of franco 's victims was tabled 18 months behind schedule , got bogged down in parliamentary wrangling and may not be submitted for definitive approval in time before the march 2008 parliamentary elections .
the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .

warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .

the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .

the kremlin announced saturday that president vladimir putin had signed a decree suspending russia 's application of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .
russia had threatened several times to pull out of the treaty amid unease over us military encroachment into territory once part of the former soviet union .

the us state department said it was " disappointed " by russia 's announcement .
washington " remains committed to cfe 's full implementation ... -lsb- and looks -rsb- forward to continuing to engage with russia and other parties to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 cfe states , " a statement said .

speaking in lithuania during a tour of the baltic countries , he said the treaty was a central element in the international architecture of disarmament .
" that is why we obviously regard moscow 's announcement with great concern . "
" in the next few days we will see what concrete measures will be taken because of this announcement , " he said , adding that he hoped russia would go no further than suspend the treaty .
poles see no immediate consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could be one of the main site in the us missile shield polish foreign ministry spokesman robert szaniawski said warsaw regretted the decision .
but he added : " taking previous announcements into account , this decision is not a surprise and does n't have immediate consequences . "
warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .
romania 's foreign ministry also expressed its " disappointment . "
" romania considers that the cfe treaty represents a basis for european security , " the ministry said , adding that it hoped " that dialogue between the states participating in the cfe treaty will be maintained and that all of the states will continue to respect their obligations within the framework of the treaty . "

swedish foreign minister carl bildt , currently on holiday , was quoted as saying that the consequences of the russian announcement needed to be analyzed but could impact the mutual information and inspection system .
gorbachev suggests move is to " spark dialogue " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev believes the us and nato forced russia 's hand meanwhile former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday that russia 's decision was taken in order to spark dialogue .
" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .
the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .
" it would have been completely incomprehensible if russia was to continue fulfilling the treaty when the other sides had not even ratified it , " said gorbachev . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 15.07.2007 franco 's dictatorship still proves problematic for spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco 's dictatorship continues to divide spain much as it did during his reign the spanish government 's attempt to settle the nation 's accounts with the 1939-75 dictatorship of general francisco franco is at the risk of failing . a draft law aimed at rehabilitating the memory of franco 's victims was tabled 18 months behind schedule , got bogged down in parliamentary wrangling and may not be submitted for definitive approval in time before the march 2008 parliamentary elections .
the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the duty of the minister " to wrack his brains " over the best way to protect citizens , the president said in an interview on germany 's second television channel zdf .
but the staccato " manner in which the suggestions came about " was not ideal .
schäuble called for legal powers to intern terrorist " combatants " before they struck and said that germany might have to introduce a us-style criminal offence of conspiracy to commit a crime .
the minister , who outlined his thoughts in the news magazine der spiegel last week , also proposed a ban on the use of the internet and mobile phones by people the state deemed to be dangerous .
schäuble calls for clarification on targeted killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler urged schäuble to think before speaking schäuble also called for clarification under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
president köhler said he had his doubts whether " the killing of a suspected terrorist without a court ruling could be treated so lightly . "
the minister 's remarks , particularly those about targeted assassinations , provoked outrage in germany , with opposition greens party leader claudia roth calling on him to resign .
schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , defended his views , saying : " you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing either . "
but the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have been in a power-sharing government with the cdu since november 2005 , warned that the minister 's remarks could threaten the continuation of the coalition .
critics call for interior minister to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : " schäuble 's protecting freedom to death " " the grand coalition can not put up for ever with schäuble is doing , " said ralf stegner , spd interior minister in the northern state of schleswig holstein .
" frau merkel has to tell him , ' enough is enough ' , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
spd chairman kurt beck accused schäuble of being excessive and losing sight of his goals .
" his proposals far surpass the current constitutional consensus .
he wants to protect freedom to death , " beck told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
schäuble 's proposals came in the wake of the failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow .
germany had a similar scare in july last year when authorities defused two suitcase bombs islamic militants placed on trains . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .
the authorities who manage the site say a large number of the visitors are young people . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .

frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .

apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .

in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .

they see the project as a chance to work on a " new libya . " " this is a coup , " said siegfried wernik from the firm leon wohlhage wernik , whose resume includes the indian embassy in berlin , bremen 's representation in the capital and the schwabengalerie mall in stuttgart .
" the opportunity to design such an extraordinary project is a privilege and a challenge . " the winning team 's design outstripped some prestigious competition , chosen over others submitted by acclaimed iraqi architect zaha hadid , japan 's kisho kurokawa and hamburg-based architects gerkan marg und partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moammar gadhafi looks to the future according to the berliners ' plans , the new government buildings will extend across 230 hectares -lrb- 568 acres -rrb- - an area as large as some 350 soccer pitches .
the project will be partially completed by 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of libyan leader moammar gadhafi taking power , but will most probably only be fully completed in 2017 . the cost will be between 2.5 billion and three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion and 4.1 billion -rrb- . following in the footsteps of niemeyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally , oscar niemeyer put brasília on the map a model of the design posted on the company 's website shows flat-roofed ministries lining a large rectangular park dotted with palm trees . the complex has already been compared by the german press to the futuristic , utopian architectural style famously employed in the brazilian capital brasilia in the 1950s by architect oscar niemeyer . it will be situated between tripoli 's international airport and the capital 's historical center and will also include a mosque , a towering five-star hotel and a conference center . new headquarters , new libya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close-up of one of the planned government buildings the firm said it tried to combine tradition and modernity in the design to show that " after years of isolation and conflict with the west , libya now stands at a crossroads between the past and the future . " long considered a pariah state , libya changed tack in 2004 when it renounced its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction wernik told the daily berliner zeitung that leon wohlhage wernik sought advice from two experts on islam , who filled them in on current political developments in the country many in germany still associate first and foremost with terrorist attacks on a berlin discotheque in 1986 . " we have done out homework on libya , " he said .
" people think of it as a dictatorship , but the country wants to be taken back into the international fold . " our impression is that the new government seat represents a new libya , " he added .
" for us , that was reason enough to get involved . " german architecture in international demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " tripoli greens " building is also part of the proposed new government center the success of the berlin team reflects the broad international popularity of german architects , who are increasingly highly sought after the world over .
from china to russia and various arab states , germans have a reputation as skilled all-rounders , able to oversee projects from design to follow-through . berlin-based architects have a particular advantage .
in the years since german reunification , the city has been completely revamped and serves as an international calling card for local architectural offices . bildunterschrift : the " new libya " is expected to be finished by 2017 " berlin 's architecture is great publicity , " said klaus meier-hartmann , president of the berlin architects ' chamber , in the berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the winning team 's design outstripped some prestigious competition , chosen over others submitted by acclaimed iraqi architect zaha hadid , japan 's kisho kurokawa and hamburg-based architects gerkan marg und partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moammar gadhafi looks to the future according to the berliners ' plans , the new government buildings will extend across 230 hectares -lrb- 568 acres -rrb- - an area as large as some 350 soccer pitches .
the project will be partially completed by 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of libyan leader moammar gadhafi taking power , but will most probably only be fully completed in 2017 . the cost will be between 2.5 billion and three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion and 4.1 billion -rrb- . following in the footsteps of niemeyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally , oscar niemeyer put brasília on the map a model of the design posted on the company 's website shows flat-roofed ministries lining a large rectangular park dotted with palm trees . the complex has already been compared by the german press to the futuristic , utopian architectural style famously employed in the brazilian capital brasilia in the 1950s by architect oscar niemeyer . it will be situated between tripoli 's international airport and the capital 's historical center and will also include a mosque , a towering five-star hotel and a conference center . new headquarters , new libya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close-up of one of the planned government buildings the firm said it tried to combine tradition and modernity in the design to show that " after years of isolation and conflict with the west , libya now stands at a crossroads between the past and the future . " long considered a pariah state , libya changed tack in 2004 when it renounced its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction wernik told the daily berliner zeitung that leon wohlhage wernik sought advice from two experts on islam , who filled them in on current political developments in the country many in germany still associate first and foremost with terrorist attacks on a berlin discotheque in 1986 . " we have done out homework on libya , " he said .
" people think of it as a dictatorship , but the country wants to be taken back into the international fold . " our impression is that the new government seat represents a new libya , " he added .
" for us , that was reason enough to get involved . " german architecture in international demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " tripoli greens " building is also part of the proposed new government center the success of the berlin team reflects the broad international popularity of german architects , who are increasingly highly sought after the world over .
from china to russia and various arab states , germans have a reputation as skilled all-rounders , able to oversee projects from design to follow-through . berlin-based architects have a particular advantage .
in the years since german reunification , the city has been completely revamped and serves as an international calling card for local architectural offices . bildunterschrift : the " new libya " is expected to be finished by 2017 " berlin 's architecture is great publicity , " said klaus meier-hartmann , president of the berlin architects ' chamber , in the berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .

elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .

the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .
frattini is determined to build up the frontex operation , announcing that the patrols will become a permanent presence in the mediterranean from january . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .
legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border agents from various countries work together in a recent report to the european parliament , the united nations refugee agency - the unhcr - also pointed to gaps in the legal framework and a lack of cooperation among eu states as reasons why up to 120,000 migrants are able to cross the mediterranean sea and enter the eu illegally each year .
apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
the government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they see the project as a chance to work on a " new libya . " " this is a coup , " said siegfried wernik from the firm leon wohlhage wernik , whose resume includes the indian embassy in berlin , bremen 's representation in the capital and the schwabengalerie mall in stuttgart .
" the opportunity to design such an extraordinary project is a privilege and a challenge . " the winning team 's design outstripped some prestigious competition , chosen over others submitted by acclaimed iraqi architect zaha hadid , japan 's kisho kurokawa and hamburg-based architects gerkan marg und partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moammar gadhafi looks to the future according to the berliners ' plans , the new government buildings will extend across 230 hectares -lrb- 568 acres -rrb- - an area as large as some 350 soccer pitches .
the project will be partially completed by 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of libyan leader moammar gadhafi taking power , but will most probably only be fully completed in 2017 . the cost will be between 2.5 billion and three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion and 4.1 billion -rrb- . following in the footsteps of niemeyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally , oscar niemeyer put brasília on the map a model of the design posted on the company 's website shows flat-roofed ministries lining a large rectangular park dotted with palm trees . the complex has already been compared by the german press to the futuristic , utopian architectural style famously employed in the brazilian capital brasilia in the 1950s by architect oscar niemeyer . it will be situated between tripoli 's international airport and the capital 's historical center and will also include a mosque , a towering five-star hotel and a conference center . new headquarters , new libya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close-up of one of the planned government buildings the firm said it tried to combine tradition and modernity in the design to show that " after years of isolation and conflict with the west , libya now stands at a crossroads between the past and the future . " long considered a pariah state , libya changed tack in 2004 when it renounced its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction wernik told the daily berliner zeitung that leon wohlhage wernik sought advice from two experts on islam , who filled them in on current political developments in the country many in germany still associate first and foremost with terrorist attacks on a berlin discotheque in 1986 . " we have done out homework on libya , " he said .
" people think of it as a dictatorship , but the country wants to be taken back into the international fold . " our impression is that the new government seat represents a new libya , " he added .

the " frontex " agency is supposed to patrol eu borders , but is it working ? warsame ali garare , a 28-year-old somali language teacher , is one of thousands of africans who have experienced first-hand the terrifying journey made by would-be immigrants who end up in malta while on their way to the european continent .
he arrived in the mediterranean island four years ago after the engine of his rickety boat stalled , leaving its occupants sucking sugar cubes for survival as they ran out of water .
but despite the terrible ordeal he , like many of his compatriots , would repeat the same voyage with or without the presence of frontex , the new european union border agency set up to stop the endless flow of would-be immigrants who enter the union illegally each year .
" what 's pushing all these immigrants to leave for europe is far bigger than any barriers that the eu is putting up , " says warsame , who now works as a translator in malta .
a shortage of vessels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journey from africa is dangerous ; many perish along the way plagued by a shortage of naval and air assets , the frontex patrol missions in the central mediterranean have had a stuttered start and have been enjoying mixed results over the past two weeks .
frontex director ilkka laitinen says four boats with a total of 99 immigrants on board had been stopped by frontex vessels until the first week of july .
however , three of the boats decided to venture to malta anyway and the fourth continued to lampedusa .
laitinen admitted that rescuers were essentially dealing with complicated rules of the sea , with the problems compounded by a lack of cooperation from libya , from where most of the immigrants depart .
" we tell the migrants that the best thing for them is to turn round and go back to where they came from because there is no future for them in europe , " laitinen said .
" if they insist on continuing their route , they just do it .
and if we are in international waters , it is not legal to escort them back to libya , " laitinen told maltese media .

apart from two patrol boats dispatched by malta , two german helicopters and a greek vessel , other participating member states such as italy and spain have only provided a token contribution to frontex operations .
germany helping out only germany has given an indication of wishing to help with malta 's " burden sharing " proposal , with the biggest eu state saying it would assume responsibility for illegal migrant survivors picked up by its two helicopters during the patrols .
libya has backed out of the arrangement and is barring any frontex vessels from entering its waters .
bildunterschrift : a frontex agent checks a passport at frankfurt airport critics say that given the reluctance by many eu member states to chip in and do their part , it is no surprise that the influx of illegal immigration continues unabated , often with tragic consequences .
in the latest episode , around 11 would-be african migrants were believed to have drowned off the coast of malta , it was reported saturday .
survivors said their fellow travellers had perished when their boat overturned in rough seas .
flow has apparently dropped yet , despite the evident problems faced by the new border mission , eu justice commissioner franco frattini argues that the flow has dropped by 40 percent since the start of the patrols .
addressing reporters in malta , frattini said the operation was dissuading human trafficking , so much so that he was informed that the market price to make the trip had plummeted from 1,000 to 250 dollars since the week prior to the frontex mission .
" the traffickers watch italian and maltese television so they knew about the start of frontex operations in the mediterranean , " the commissioner said after attending a demonstration of frontex operations on board a maltese vessel in choppy seas whipped up by force six winds .

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .

the so-called law of historic memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government .
it is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the franco era would reopen old wounds .
for far-left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by francoists .
the law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
in contrast to other countries which had fascist regimes , such as germany and italy , spain has never made a clean break with its one-time dictator .
after the death of the caudillo -lrb- leader -rrb- put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
a truthful picture of franco ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936-39 civil war , which was sparked by franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
about half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
the government thought the time was ripe to finally lay franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which grew partly out of francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" spaniards do not want to know anything about franco , " pp leader mariano rajoy said .
" they are more concerned with education and health care . "
removal of franco-era monuments not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing franco 's statue in zaragoza did not erase him from history the far-left party izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
it was backed by regionalist parties such as the erc in north-eastern catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the franco regime .
the iu and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
the most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
the government rejected the iu 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the franco era .
the two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
the iu and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the valley of the fallen , franco 's huge mausoleum near madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
they are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .

" we 're disappointed russia has suspended its participation for now , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement .
" but we 'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area , that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in europe , " he added .
the kremlin announced saturday that president vladimir putin had signed a decree suspending russia 's application of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
the cfe treaty , which came into force in 1992 , is one of the key post-cold war security accords in europe .
it limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to nato and the former warsaw pact in eastern europe and lays down measures aimed at confidence-building , transparency and cooperation between member states .
russia had threatened several times to pull out of the treaty amid unease over us military encroachment into territory once part of the former soviet union .
moscow particularly objected to us plans to place elements of a missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic .
the us state department said it was " disappointed " by russia 's announcement .
washington " remains committed to cfe 's full implementation ... -lsb- and looks -rsb- forward to continuing to engage with russia and other parties to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 cfe states , " a statement said .
nato laments a " step back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato considers the treaty to be the bedrock of security nato spokesman james appathurai also expressed disappointment .
" it 's a disappointing move , a step backwards .
nato considers this treaty to be an important foundation of european security and stability , " he said .
the osce expressed its concern through spain , which currently holds the presidency of the 56-member organization .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos called on all signatory states " to renew their efforts to examine the underlying difficulties swiftly and earnestly and work together to overcome them . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile expressed his " great concern . "
speaking in lithuania during a tour of the baltic countries , he said the treaty was a central element in the international architecture of disarmament .
" that is why we obviously regard moscow 's announcement with great concern . "
" in the next few days we will see what concrete measures will be taken because of this announcement , " he said , adding that he hoped russia would go no further than suspend the treaty .
poles see no immediate consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could be one of the main site in the us missile shield polish foreign ministry spokesman robert szaniawski said warsaw regretted the decision .
but he added : " taking previous announcements into account , this decision is not a surprise and does n't have immediate consequences . "
warsaw hoped the decision did not mean " a future denunciation of the treaty " by putin , given russia 's importance for european and world security .
romania 's foreign ministry also expressed its " disappointment . "
" romania considers that the cfe treaty represents a basis for european security , " the ministry said , adding that it hoped " that dialogue between the states participating in the cfe treaty will be maintained and that all of the states will continue to respect their obligations within the framework of the treaty . "
finnish defense minister jyri hakamies sunday said the decision was negative from a finnish point of view .
in remarks to finnish broadcaster yle , hakamies said tension between the major powers was never good but added the announcement by moscow should not be over-emphasized .
in oslo , norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store saturday expressed " regret " over the announcement by moscow .
in a statement , store said the cfe treaty " has been an important instrument that has contributed to security and stability in europe since it came into force in 1992 . "
norway is a member of nato .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , currently on holiday , was quoted as saying that the consequences of the russian announcement needed to be analyzed but could impact the mutual information and inspection system .
gorbachev suggests move is to " spark dialogue " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev believes the us and nato forced russia 's hand meanwhile former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday that russia 's decision was taken in order to spark dialogue .
" the decision of the head of state was an urgent call ... to constructive dialogue and the implementation of the treaty , " interfax news agency quoted gorbachev as saying .
the decision was an " entirely justified response to the question and not an emotional outburst , " said gorbachev , who signed the original treaty in 1990 .
he cited the american anti-missile shield and nato members ' failure to ratify an updated version of the treaty as justifications for the suspension .
" it would have been completely incomprehensible if russia was to continue fulfilling the treaty when the other sides had not even ratified it , " said gorbachev . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the construction of the largest concentration camp in hitler 's germany , where 56,000 people lost their lives .
elderly survivors , one of them a former ukrainian prisoner who came dressed in a striped blue and white concentration camp uniform , laid wreaths at the former camp outside the east german city .
" in 1945 , we never dreamed that today in germany there would again be right-wing forces that would be allowed to demonstrate in our cities , " former inmate ottomar rothmann said .
democratically guaranteed constitutional rights should not be seen as a license for rallies by fascist groups , rothmann said , who spent two years in buchenwald as a political prisoner .
survivors call for npd to be banned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors ca n't believe the npd is allowed to exist rothmann urged german politicians to do all they can " to ban the neo-nazi npd , " a reference to the extreme right wing political party that is represented in two regional parliaments in eastern germany .
a potential ban has been supported by several political leaders , including berlin 's social-democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , but legal hurdles remain .
the last attempt to ban the npd was dismissed by germany 's constitutional court in 2003 .
the speeches denouncing the far-right at the ceremony followed a statement issued by the survivors themselves on saturday .
" who will speak of the nazi crimes , who will oppose the neo-nazis and all those who trample on democracy and human dignity ?
who will speak up when we are no longer there ? " the statement said .
a quarter-million inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates from 36 nations were imprisoned in the camp buchenwald was founded by the nazis on july 15 , 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , political opponents and homosexuals .
some 250,000 people from 36 countries were incarcerated in the camp until it was liberated by the us army on april 11 , 1945 .
prisoners perished in the cold or starved to death and thousands were murdered .
a large percentage of the victims remain nameless , while the identities of many others were only established in the past decade .
located near the cultural city of weimar , the camp is now a memorial site visited by around 600,000 people annually , many of which at least a quarter of them are foreigners .

the human security act allows the government to detain suspects for up to three days without charge , use wiretaps and also seize suspects ' assets .
the government in manila says the law will help it to tackle militant groups , such as abu sayyaf .
but critics , including the roman catholic church , fear the law could be used to quell legitimate political dissent in the country .
the philippines has been fighting against a wide range of insurgent groups for years , including the al-qaeda-linked abu sayyaf .
the government says the anti-terrorism law will give it a specific weapon to counter extremists , including choking off funds used to finance their attacks .
the government also argues there are adequate safeguards in the law , pointing out the detention period without charge is far shorter than in many other countries , while wiretapping requires a court order .
but critics , including the influential roman catholic church , fear president gloria arroyo may be tempted to use the new powers to harass her political rivals .
they also say the law is being pushed through without clear implementing guidelines .
opponents further worry that rogue elements in the army , accused of killing hundreds of mainly political activists over the past few years , will take the new law as a green light to step up their murderous activities , our correspondent says .

a speech in washington by the british cabinet minister douglas alexander appeared to be part of a distancing of the new british government from the bush administration , though there will not be a decisive break .
there was another instance of the distancing on saturday when a new foreign office minister mark malloch brown , a critic of us policy when he was at the un , said that the us and uk would no longer be " joined at the hip " .
however , mr brown reacted by trying to stop the impression of a break with the us .
cabinet ministers have been reminded of the importance of the relationship .
and the foreign secretary david miliband took to writing an article in the news of the world , saying that there was no evidence that the alliance was " breaking up ... and there wo n't be any . "
however , the suggestion is not that the alliance is breaking up , but that it is going to get a little less close .
it is difficult not to conclude that there is a change of atmosphere .
it is subtle and any idea that it is a major shift upsets the government , but it is surely there .
mr alexander , newly promoted to the senior role of secretary for international development , made a series of references to the need for an internationalist approach to world problems and at the heart of his speech were these two paragraphs : " we need to demonstrate by our word and our actions that we are : internationalist not isolationist ; multilateralist not unilateralist ; active not passive ; and driven by core values consistently applied , not special interests .
" isolationism simply does not work in an interdependent world .
there is no security or prosperity at home unless we deal with the global challenges of security , globalization , climate change , disease and poverty .
we must recognise these challenges and champion an internationalist approach - seeking shared solutions to the problems we face . "
no sudden detachment however he did not criticise us foreign policy and he also made it clear that britain under gordon brown is not going to suddenly detach itself from us policy in iraq or afghanistan .
for he also said : " today the uk stands together with the us in confronting international terrorism and confronting violent insurgents in iraq and afghanistan . "
we must recognise these challenges and champion an internationalist approach douglas alexander douglas alexander is close to mr brown -lrb- he has been appointed labour 's general election coordinator -rrb- and they are both atlanticists , with an affection for the united states and its politics .
mr alexander studied at the university of pennsylvania and worked for a time as an aide in the us congress .
it was significant that he chose as his audience the council on foreign relations , a liberal-minded body highly critical of the bush administration 's policy in iraq .
it has just published a study by one of its senior fellows , steven simon , calling for a us withdrawal .
mr brown 's spokesman denied that the speech represented criticism of the united states and said that it was not designed to send a signal to the us .
mr brown himself said later : " we 'll not allow people to separate us from the united states of america in dealing with the common challenges we face around the world . "
the signals the speech however has to be seen in the context of other measures for change taken by mr brown , including the appointment of mark malloch brown .
gordon brown also stressed to the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , whom he met in london on thursday , that britain would always aim at multilateralism in foreign policy , though holding its options open for independent action in the final analysis .
that was perhaps code for - no more iraqs .
so the signals are clear - british foreign policy is going through a subtle shift .
the blair era is over .
the implications the implications of this are quite profound , because a distancing from the united states has coincided with a british refusal to give the european union more powers in foreign policy .
a free hand in foreign affairs was one of the british " red lines " in the recent treaty negotiations .
the brown government appears to be aiming at acting as far as possible through international organisations -lrb- mr alexander 's speech was full of this -rrb- .
as chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown favoured such policies in tackling global poverty and global warming .
but a britain not as close to the united states and not willing to get closer to europe leaves itself open to having less influence , for better or for worse .
iran and looming on the horizon is the problem of iran .
in his news conference in washington on thursday , president bush drew together , in one prepared sentence , the developing , and much contested , us accusations against iran : " the same regime in iran that is pursuing nuclear weapons and threatening to wipe israel off the map is also providing sophisticated ieds -lsb- improvised explosive devices -rsb- to extremists in iraq who are using them to kill american soldiers . "
would britain under gordon brown support military action against iran ?
it is unlikely that britain would join such action .
it is not inconceivable that it would support it , but only as a very , very last resort , with incontestable evidence that iran 's nuclear weapon ambitions were real .

a speech in washington by the british cabinet minister douglas alexander appeared to be part of a distancing of the new british government from the bush administration , though there will not be a decisive break .
there was another instance of the distancing on saturday when a new foreign office minister mark malloch brown , a critic of us policy when he was at the un , said that the us and uk would no longer be " joined at the hip " .
however , mr brown reacted by trying to stop the impression of a break with the us .
cabinet ministers have been reminded of the importance of the relationship .
and the foreign secretary david miliband took to writing an article in the news of the world , saying that there was no evidence that the alliance was " breaking up ... and there wo n't be any . "
however , the suggestion is not that the alliance is breaking up , but that it is going to get a little less close .
it is difficult not to conclude that there is a change of atmosphere .
it is subtle and any idea that it is a major shift upsets the government , but it is surely there .
mr alexander , newly promoted to the senior role of secretary for international development , made a series of references to the need for an internationalist approach to world problems and at the heart of his speech were these two paragraphs : " we need to demonstrate by our word and our actions that we are : internationalist not isolationist ; multilateralist not unilateralist ; active not passive ; and driven by core values consistently applied , not special interests .
" isolationism simply does not work in an interdependent world .
there is no security or prosperity at home unless we deal with the global challenges of security , globalization , climate change , disease and poverty .
we must recognise these challenges and champion an internationalist approach - seeking shared solutions to the problems we face . "
no sudden detachment however he did not criticise us foreign policy and he also made it clear that britain under gordon brown is not going to suddenly detach itself from us policy in iraq or afghanistan .
for he also said : " today the uk stands together with the us in confronting international terrorism and confronting violent insurgents in iraq and afghanistan . "

it is difficult not to conclude that there is a change of atmosphere .
it is subtle and any idea that it is a major shift upsets the government , but it is surely there .
mr alexander , newly promoted to the senior role of secretary for international development , made a series of references to the need for an internationalist approach to world problems and at the heart of his speech were these two paragraphs : " we need to demonstrate by our word and our actions that we are : internationalist not isolationist ; multilateralist not unilateralist ; active not passive ; and driven by core values consistently applied , not special interests .
" isolationism simply does not work in an interdependent world .
there is no security or prosperity at home unless we deal with the global challenges of security , globalization , climate change , disease and poverty .
we must recognise these challenges and champion an internationalist approach - seeking shared solutions to the problems we face . "
no sudden detachment however he did not criticise us foreign policy and he also made it clear that britain under gordon brown is not going to suddenly detach itself from us policy in iraq or afghanistan .
for he also said : " today the uk stands together with the us in confronting international terrorism and confronting violent insurgents in iraq and afghanistan . "
" we must recognise these challenges and champion an internationalist approach " douglas alexander douglas alexander is close to mr brown -lrb- he has been appointed labour 's general election coordinator -rrb- and they are both atlanticists , with an affection for the united states and its politics .
mr alexander studied at the university of pennsylvania and worked for a time as an aide in the us congress .
it was significant that he chose as his audience the council on foreign relations , a liberal-minded body highly critical of the bush administration 's policy in iraq .
it has just published a study by one of its senior fellows , steven simon , calling for a us withdrawal .
mr brown 's spokesman denied that the speech represented criticism of the united states and said that it was not designed to send a signal to the us .
mr brown himself said later : " we 'll not allow people to separate us from the united states of america in dealing with the common challenges we face around the world . "
the signals the speech however has to be seen in the context of other measures for change taken by mr brown , including the appointment of mark malloch brown .
gordon brown also stressed to the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , whom he met in london on thursday , that britain would always aim at multilateralism in foreign policy , though holding its options open for independent action in the final analysis .
that was perhaps code for - no more iraqs .
so the signals are clear - british foreign policy is going through a subtle shift .
the blair era is over .
the implications the implications of this are quite profound , because a distancing from the united states has coincided with a british refusal to give the european union more powers in foreign policy .
a free hand in foreign affairs was one of the british " red lines " in the recent treaty negotiations .
the brown government appears to be aiming at acting as far as possible through international organisations -lrb- mr alexander 's speech was full of this -rrb- .
as chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown favoured such policies in tackling global poverty and global warming .
but a britain not as close to the united states and not willing to get closer to europe leaves itself open to having less influence , for better or for worse .
iran and looming on the horizon is the problem of iran .
in his news conference in washington on thursday , president bush drew together , in one prepared sentence , the developing , and much contested , us accusations against iran : " the same regime in iran that is pursuing nuclear weapons and threatening to wipe israel off the map is also providing sophisticated ieds -lsb- improvised explosive devices -rsb- to extremists in iraq who are using them to kill american soldiers . "
would britain under gordon brown support military action against iran ?
it is unlikely that britain would join such action .
it is not inconceivable that it would support it , but only as a very , very last resort , with incontestable evidence that iran 's nuclear weapon ambitions were real .

the government is expected to unveil plans for thousands of new council homes after 10 years of labour opposition to such housing .
adam sampson , chief executive of the housing charity , said more social housing was needed as fast as possible .
but defend council housing blamed government policy of " dis-investing " in council homes for a housing shortage . "
the private sector just has n't ever delivered the decent , affordable , secure homes that people need " alan walter defend council housing speaking at a labour policy forum on saturday , gordon brown said he had seen young children suffering because of sub-standard accommodation and young couples unable to buy their first home .
he said local authorities and housing associations would have a larger role and more money would be put into rented accommodation .
mr sampson said : " whether or not it has to be council is neither here nor there .
the key thing is that the government bring on as quickly as possible as much socially rented homes as we can create .
' council ghettos ' " but it 's also important that those homes are built in the right place and we do n't go back to the council ghettos that we had in the past . "
he added that the major shortage in social housing was a consequence of selling off a third of the six million council homes under the right-to-buy scheme .
last week , gordon brown announced that three million new homes would be built by 2020 - up 250,000 from the previous plan .
alan walter , chairman of the defend housing campaign , told bbc news 24 it had been " fighting for more than 10 years " to stop government privatising .
" they 've been blackmailing council tenants to have a change of landlord in return for improvements , and that 's not on , " he said .
" part of the reason we 've got a housing crisis is that the private sector just has n't ever delivered the decent , affordable , secure homes that people need .
" and that 's why people fought for council housing in the first place . "
