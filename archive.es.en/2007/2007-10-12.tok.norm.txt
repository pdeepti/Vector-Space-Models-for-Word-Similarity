" i am deeply honored to receive the nobel peace prize , " gore said in a statement .
" this award is even more meaningful because i have the honor of sharing it with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ... whose members have worked tirelessly and selflessly for many years . " gore called the fight against climate change " planetary emergency " and a " moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity . " european praise german chancellor angela merkel congratulated gore and ipcc on their shared honor saying it was a triumph for efforts to fight global warming .

the defense and foreign ministers also disagreed on the state of soviet-era weapons treaty . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the us would move forward with plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , while russia upheld its threat to withdraw from soviet-era arms control treaties if the system was a " unilateral " us project . rice and secretary of defense robert gates were in moscow to " two-plus-two " talks with russian counterparts sergey lavrov and anatoly serdyukov to allay russian fears that the system imperiled russia 's nuclear deterrent . moscow would take measures to " neutralize " the missile threat if it does not assume a " global " character , lavrov told journalists following the talks , interfax reported . " we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

the defense and foreign ministers also disagreed on the state of soviet-era weapons treaty . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the us would move forward with plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , while russia upheld its threat to withdraw from soviet-era arms control treaties if the system was a " unilateral " us project . rice and secretary of defense robert gates were in moscow to " two-plus-two " talks with russian counterparts sergey lavrov and anatoly serdyukov to allay russian fears that the system imperiled russia 's nuclear deterrent . moscow would take measures to " neutralize " the missile threat if it does not assume a " global " character , lavrov told journalists following the talks , interfax reported . " we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .

but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase . many german commuters took to the roads on friday , oct .
12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .
the industrial action is a rarity in germany as unions and companies usually work closely to reach collective agreements . half of trains running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters heeded the warnings and drove their cars to work deutsche bahn said because the strike was n't announced until thursday evening , it was unable to implement a comprehensive alternative transport plan .
some long-distance trains have been used for regional transport and extra busses are in service . the railway said 1,700 trains had been cancelled by midday , and the strike would cost " millions " of euros , director of commuter services karl-friedrich rausch told n24 television . about half of the local trains were running friday morning .
about 20 percent of train drivers do not belong to the striking german train drivers ' union , gdl .
others conductors are civil servants who not allowed to strike .
long-distance trains are in service , as a court ruling has forbidden their drivers from striking . many of the network 's 10 million daily passengers drove to work , creating traffic jams in major cities , automobile club adac spokesman maxi hartung told german television . union wants one third more pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train drivers ' strike left millions waiting around germany after a meeting thursday evening with gdl chief manfred schell , deutsche bahn boss hartmut mehdorn announced that his company would make a new offer by monday , which he said would put an end to strikes , at least through the end of the month . deutsche bahn has reached a deal with two other unions which allows for a 4.5 percent pay hike and higher pay for longer hours , resulting in a package totaling 10 percent .
gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers . " we would withdraw the 31 percent demand if deutsche bahn discussed a separate agreement , " gdl said thursday . deutsche bahn has refused to negotiate a separate deal from what was agreed with the other two rail unions . deutsche bahn accused of " dishonest means " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl does n't like the deal reached between deutsche bahn and other unions gdl 's claus weselsky said deutsche bahn had illegally threatened strikers with dismissal friday . " for us , the dishonest means with which the employer is attempting to undermine the lawful labor dispute are unacceptable , " weselsky said . deutsche bahn board member karl-friedrich rausch said gdl bore sole responsibility for the " foreseeable chaos " in transport by calling a strike at such short notice . norbert hansen , the head of transnet , one of germany 's other rail unions , said friday that the gdl action was " a totally superfluous strike , " adding that gdl leader schell should have cancelled his strike call pending the new deutsche bahn offer . according to a survey by stern newsmagazine earlier this week , 55 percent of germans sympathize with the strikers despite the inconvenience caused by the strikes . deutsche bahn , which serves 5 million passengers on some 28,000 trains daily , is europe 's largest rail company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.10.2007 opinion : peace prize for gore means little to world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while fighting climate change does play a role in spreading world peace , a nobel peace prize for former us vice president al gore was unnecessary and ill timed , according to dw 's christina bergmann . for some time the nobel prize committee has no longer bestowed its most renowned award on traditional politicians and peacemakers , which is a positive development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

" this award is even more meaningful because i have the honor of sharing it with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ... whose members have worked tirelessly and selflessly for many years . " gore called the fight against climate change " planetary emergency " and a " moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity . " european praise german chancellor angela merkel congratulated gore and ipcc on their shared honor saying it was a triumph for efforts to fight global warming .

eu president barroso called them an " inspiration . " gore and the ipcc were cited " for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change , and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change , " the norwegian nobel committee said . " i am deeply honored to receive the nobel peace prize , " gore said in a statement .
" this award is even more meaningful because i have the honor of sharing it with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ... whose members have worked tirelessly and selflessly for many years . " gore called the fight against climate change " planetary emergency " and a " moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity . " european praise german chancellor angela merkel congratulated gore and ipcc on their shared honor saying it was a triumph for efforts to fight global warming . " the dangers of climate change are among humanity 's biggest challenges , " said merkel , who has also earned a reputation as green campaigner after convincing the usa at june 's g8 summit to commit , in principle , to cutting carbon emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore worked to raise public awareness of climate change in the film " an inconvenient truth " " al gore has contributed for years like no other to increase global awareness of the need to develop strong , effective strategies against climate changes , " she said in a statement on her government web site . european commission president jose manuel barroso congratulated the winners .
he said their efforts to raise awareness about man-made climate change had been " an inspiration for politicians and citizens alike . " barroso also called on all the eu 's partners to see the prize as an encouragement to take swifter and more decisive action on climate change . ipcc head rajendra pachauri said the prize should help the fight against global warming .

it 's my organization and the efforts the organization has put in , " he said . making climate change understandable the ipcc was founded in 1988 to investigate the risks of global warming .

the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase . many german commuters took to the roads on friday , oct .
12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .
the industrial action is a rarity in germany as unions and companies usually work closely to reach collective agreements . half of trains running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters heeded the warnings and drove their cars to work deutsche bahn said because the strike was n't announced until thursday evening , it was unable to implement a comprehensive alternative transport plan .

gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers . " we would withdraw the 31 percent demand if deutsche bahn discussed a separate agreement , " gdl said thursday . deutsche bahn has refused to negotiate a separate deal from what was agreed with the other two rail unions . deutsche bahn accused of " dishonest means " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl does n't like the deal reached between deutsche bahn and other unions gdl 's claus weselsky said deutsche bahn had illegally threatened strikers with dismissal friday . " for us , the dishonest means with which the employer is attempting to undermine the lawful labor dispute are unacceptable , " weselsky said . deutsche bahn board member karl-friedrich rausch said gdl bore sole responsibility for the " foreseeable chaos " in transport by calling a strike at such short notice . norbert hansen , the head of transnet , one of germany 's other rail unions , said friday that the gdl action was " a totally superfluous strike , " adding that gdl leader schell should have cancelled his strike call pending the new deutsche bahn offer . according to a survey by stern newsmagazine earlier this week , 55 percent of germans sympathize with the strikers despite the inconvenience caused by the strikes . deutsche bahn , which serves 5 million passengers on some 28,000 trains daily , is europe 's largest rail company .

both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .

" we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .

gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers .

the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase . many german commuters took to the roads on friday , oct .
12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .
the industrial action is a rarity in germany as unions and companies usually work closely to reach collective agreements . half of trains running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters heeded the warnings and drove their cars to work deutsche bahn said because the strike was n't announced until thursday evening , it was unable to implement a comprehensive alternative transport plan .
some long-distance trains have been used for regional transport and extra busses are in service . the railway said 1,700 trains had been cancelled by midday , and the strike would cost " millions " of euros , director of commuter services karl-friedrich rausch told n24 television . about half of the local trains were running friday morning .
about 20 percent of train drivers do not belong to the striking german train drivers ' union , gdl .
others conductors are civil servants who not allowed to strike .
long-distance trains are in service , as a court ruling has forbidden their drivers from striking . many of the network 's 10 million daily passengers drove to work , creating traffic jams in major cities , automobile club adac spokesman maxi hartung told german television . union wants one third more pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train drivers ' strike left millions waiting around germany after a meeting thursday evening with gdl chief manfred schell , deutsche bahn boss hartmut mehdorn announced that his company would make a new offer by monday , which he said would put an end to strikes , at least through the end of the month . deutsche bahn has reached a deal with two other unions which allows for a 4.5 percent pay hike and higher pay for longer hours , resulting in a package totaling 10 percent .
gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers . " we would withdraw the 31 percent demand if deutsche bahn discussed a separate agreement , " gdl said thursday . deutsche bahn has refused to negotiate a separate deal from what was agreed with the other two rail unions . deutsche bahn accused of " dishonest means " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl does n't like the deal reached between deutsche bahn and other unions gdl 's claus weselsky said deutsche bahn had illegally threatened strikers with dismissal friday . " for us , the dishonest means with which the employer is attempting to undermine the lawful labor dispute are unacceptable , " weselsky said . deutsche bahn board member karl-friedrich rausch said gdl bore sole responsibility for the " foreseeable chaos " in transport by calling a strike at such short notice . norbert hansen , the head of transnet , one of germany 's other rail unions , said friday that the gdl action was " a totally superfluous strike , " adding that gdl leader schell should have cancelled his strike call pending the new deutsche bahn offer . according to a survey by stern newsmagazine earlier this week , 55 percent of germans sympathize with the strikers despite the inconvenience caused by the strikes . deutsche bahn , which serves 5 million passengers on some 28,000 trains daily , is europe 's largest rail company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.10.2007 opinion : peace prize for gore means little to world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while fighting climate change does play a role in spreading world peace , a nobel peace prize for former us vice president al gore was unnecessary and ill timed , according to dw 's christina bergmann . for some time the nobel prize committee has no longer bestowed its most renowned award on traditional politicians and peacemakers , which is a positive development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

the missives were found in an archive in moscow . german historian henrik eberle compiled " briefe an hitler " -lrb- " letters to hitler " -rrb- after sifting through more than 20,000 documents war-time documents in the russian state archives .
the book was released at the frankfurt book fair this week .
one letter from gina , a girl from a poor family in berlin , pays testimony to the devotion that hitler could inspire .
" i love you so much , please write to me , " the girl wrote in block capitals .
her father included her letter along with a request for pictures of hitler for his children and proudly announced that gina was determined to marry the nazi leader because he was " the best man in the world . " father figure and ideal partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letters in eberle 's book reflect the enthusiasm felt by many germans many other parents similarly sent pictures of their children , wrote to wish him a merry christmas .
party officials and politicians sent their greetings in cards covered in swastikas .
a small number of jews and jehovah 's witnesses also wrote to hitler , begging him to spare their family members .
there is also a small number of letters from non-germans .
the letters compiled in eberle 's books , which is currently only available in german , begin in 1925 - some seven years before hitler took over power - and end just before his suicide in 1945 .
at the peak of his popularity in 1938 the nazi dictator received 10,000 letters , compared with 200 in 1925 , political barometer eberle , who teaches at martin luther university in the german city of halle , said hitler 's deputy rudolf hess and albert bormann , a close aide , sorted the letters in a bid " to keep hitler informed of the political climate among the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eberle 's book is one of the thousands of new titles being presented at this year 's frankfurt book fair the author told the afp news agency that the book showed german support for hitler increasing in the early 1930s , but also that most correspondents were more concerned with their economic and social well-being than with his policies towards the jews .
" in 1925 , the letters mainly contained advice to hitler , some asking him to be more socialist in his policies , others saying he should expel the jews , " he said .
" but from 1932 , people wanted hitler to become dictator and their fervor for the führer became palpable in the letters . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the missives were found in an archive in moscow . german historian henrik eberle compiled " briefe an hitler " -lrb- " letters to hitler " -rrb- after sifting through more than 20,000 documents war-time documents in the russian state archives .
the book was released at the frankfurt book fair this week .
one letter from gina , a girl from a poor family in berlin , pays testimony to the devotion that hitler could inspire .
" i love you so much , please write to me , " the girl wrote in block capitals .
her father included her letter along with a request for pictures of hitler for his children and proudly announced that gina was determined to marry the nazi leader because he was " the best man in the world . " father figure and ideal partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letters in eberle 's book reflect the enthusiasm felt by many germans many other parents similarly sent pictures of their children , wrote to wish him a merry christmas .
party officials and politicians sent their greetings in cards covered in swastikas .
a small number of jews and jehovah 's witnesses also wrote to hitler , begging him to spare their family members .
there is also a small number of letters from non-germans .
the letters compiled in eberle 's books , which is currently only available in german , begin in 1925 - some seven years before hitler took over power - and end just before his suicide in 1945 .
at the peak of his popularity in 1938 the nazi dictator received 10,000 letters , compared with 200 in 1925 , political barometer eberle , who teaches at martin luther university in the german city of halle , said hitler 's deputy rudolf hess and albert bormann , a close aide , sorted the letters in a bid " to keep hitler informed of the political climate among the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eberle 's book is one of the thousands of new titles being presented at this year 's frankfurt book fair the author told the afp news agency that the book showed german support for hitler increasing in the early 1930s , but also that most correspondents were more concerned with their economic and social well-being than with his policies towards the jews .
" in 1925 , the letters mainly contained advice to hitler , some asking him to be more socialist in his policies , others saying he should expel the jews , " he said .
" but from 1932 , people wanted hitler to become dictator and their fervor for the führer became palpable in the letters . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

the missives were found in an archive in moscow . german historian henrik eberle compiled " briefe an hitler " -lrb- " letters to hitler " -rrb- after sifting through more than 20,000 documents war-time documents in the russian state archives .
the book was released at the frankfurt book fair this week .
one letter from gina , a girl from a poor family in berlin , pays testimony to the devotion that hitler could inspire .
" i love you so much , please write to me , " the girl wrote in block capitals .
her father included her letter along with a request for pictures of hitler for his children and proudly announced that gina was determined to marry the nazi leader because he was " the best man in the world . " father figure and ideal partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letters in eberle 's book reflect the enthusiasm felt by many germans many other parents similarly sent pictures of their children , wrote to wish him a merry christmas .
party officials and politicians sent their greetings in cards covered in swastikas .
a small number of jews and jehovah 's witnesses also wrote to hitler , begging him to spare their family members .
there is also a small number of letters from non-germans .
the letters compiled in eberle 's books , which is currently only available in german , begin in 1925 - some seven years before hitler took over power - and end just before his suicide in 1945 .
at the peak of his popularity in 1938 the nazi dictator received 10,000 letters , compared with 200 in 1925 , political barometer eberle , who teaches at martin luther university in the german city of halle , said hitler 's deputy rudolf hess and albert bormann , a close aide , sorted the letters in a bid " to keep hitler informed of the political climate among the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eberle 's book is one of the thousands of new titles being presented at this year 's frankfurt book fair the author told the afp news agency that the book showed german support for hitler increasing in the early 1930s , but also that most correspondents were more concerned with their economic and social well-being than with his policies towards the jews .
" in 1925 , the letters mainly contained advice to hitler , some asking him to be more socialist in his policies , others saying he should expel the jews , " he said .
" but from 1932 , people wanted hitler to become dictator and their fervor for the führer became palpable in the letters . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defense and foreign ministers also disagreed on the state of soviet-era weapons treaty . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the us would move forward with plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , while russia upheld its threat to withdraw from soviet-era arms control treaties if the system was a " unilateral " us project . rice and secretary of defense robert gates were in moscow to " two-plus-two " talks with russian counterparts sergey lavrov and anatoly serdyukov to allay russian fears that the system imperiled russia 's nuclear deterrent . moscow would take measures to " neutralize " the missile threat if it does not assume a " global " character , lavrov told journalists following the talks , interfax reported . " we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .

the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase . many german commuters took to the roads on friday , oct .
12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .
the industrial action is a rarity in germany as unions and companies usually work closely to reach collective agreements . half of trains running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters heeded the warnings and drove their cars to work deutsche bahn said because the strike was n't announced until thursday evening , it was unable to implement a comprehensive alternative transport plan .
some long-distance trains have been used for regional transport and extra busses are in service . the railway said 1,700 trains had been cancelled by midday , and the strike would cost " millions " of euros , director of commuter services karl-friedrich rausch told n24 television . about half of the local trains were running friday morning .
about 20 percent of train drivers do not belong to the striking german train drivers ' union , gdl .
others conductors are civil servants who not allowed to strike .
long-distance trains are in service , as a court ruling has forbidden their drivers from striking . many of the network 's 10 million daily passengers drove to work , creating traffic jams in major cities , automobile club adac spokesman maxi hartung told german television . union wants one third more pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train drivers ' strike left millions waiting around germany after a meeting thursday evening with gdl chief manfred schell , deutsche bahn boss hartmut mehdorn announced that his company would make a new offer by monday , which he said would put an end to strikes , at least through the end of the month . deutsche bahn has reached a deal with two other unions which allows for a 4.5 percent pay hike and higher pay for longer hours , resulting in a package totaling 10 percent .
gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers . " we would withdraw the 31 percent demand if deutsche bahn discussed a separate agreement , " gdl said thursday . deutsche bahn has refused to negotiate a separate deal from what was agreed with the other two rail unions . deutsche bahn accused of " dishonest means " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl does n't like the deal reached between deutsche bahn and other unions gdl 's claus weselsky said deutsche bahn had illegally threatened strikers with dismissal friday . " for us , the dishonest means with which the employer is attempting to undermine the lawful labor dispute are unacceptable , " weselsky said . deutsche bahn board member karl-friedrich rausch said gdl bore sole responsibility for the " foreseeable chaos " in transport by calling a strike at such short notice . norbert hansen , the head of transnet , one of germany 's other rail unions , said friday that the gdl action was " a totally superfluous strike , " adding that gdl leader schell should have cancelled his strike call pending the new deutsche bahn offer . according to a survey by stern newsmagazine earlier this week , 55 percent of germans sympathize with the strikers despite the inconvenience caused by the strikes . deutsche bahn , which serves 5 million passengers on some 28,000 trains daily , is europe 's largest rail company .

the missives were found in an archive in moscow . german historian henrik eberle compiled " briefe an hitler " -lrb- " letters to hitler " -rrb- after sifting through more than 20,000 documents war-time documents in the russian state archives .
the book was released at the frankfurt book fair this week .
one letter from gina , a girl from a poor family in berlin , pays testimony to the devotion that hitler could inspire .
" i love you so much , please write to me , " the girl wrote in block capitals .
her father included her letter along with a request for pictures of hitler for his children and proudly announced that gina was determined to marry the nazi leader because he was " the best man in the world . " father figure and ideal partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letters in eberle 's book reflect the enthusiasm felt by many germans many other parents similarly sent pictures of their children , wrote to wish him a merry christmas .
party officials and politicians sent their greetings in cards covered in swastikas .
a small number of jews and jehovah 's witnesses also wrote to hitler , begging him to spare their family members .
there is also a small number of letters from non-germans .
the letters compiled in eberle 's books , which is currently only available in german , begin in 1925 - some seven years before hitler took over power - and end just before his suicide in 1945 .
at the peak of his popularity in 1938 the nazi dictator received 10,000 letters , compared with 200 in 1925 , political barometer eberle , who teaches at martin luther university in the german city of halle , said hitler 's deputy rudolf hess and albert bormann , a close aide , sorted the letters in a bid " to keep hitler informed of the political climate among the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eberle 's book is one of the thousands of new titles being presented at this year 's frankfurt book fair the author told the afp news agency that the book showed german support for hitler increasing in the early 1930s , but also that most correspondents were more concerned with their economic and social well-being than with his policies towards the jews .
" in 1925 , the letters mainly contained advice to hitler , some asking him to be more socialist in his policies , others saying he should expel the jews , " he said .
" but from 1932 , people wanted hitler to become dictator and their fervor for the führer became palpable in the letters . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am deeply honored to receive the nobel peace prize , " gore said in a statement .
" this award is even more meaningful because i have the honor of sharing it with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ... whose members have worked tirelessly and selflessly for many years . " gore called the fight against climate change " planetary emergency " and a " moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity . " european praise german chancellor angela merkel congratulated gore and ipcc on their shared honor saying it was a triumph for efforts to fight global warming . " the dangers of climate change are among humanity 's biggest challenges , " said merkel , who has also earned a reputation as green campaigner after convincing the usa at june 's g8 summit to commit , in principle , to cutting carbon emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore worked to raise public awareness of climate change in the film " an inconvenient truth " " al gore has contributed for years like no other to increase global awareness of the need to develop strong , effective strategies against climate changes , " she said in a statement on her government web site . european commission president jose manuel barroso congratulated the winners .

the defense and foreign ministers also disagreed on the state of soviet-era weapons treaty . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the us would move forward with plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , while russia upheld its threat to withdraw from soviet-era arms control treaties if the system was a " unilateral " us project . rice and secretary of defense robert gates were in moscow to " two-plus-two " talks with russian counterparts sergey lavrov and anatoly serdyukov to allay russian fears that the system imperiled russia 's nuclear deterrent . moscow would take measures to " neutralize " the missile threat if it does not assume a " global " character , lavrov told journalists following the talks , interfax reported . " we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

the missives were found in an archive in moscow . german historian henrik eberle compiled " briefe an hitler " -lrb- " letters to hitler " -rrb- after sifting through more than 20,000 documents war-time documents in the russian state archives .
the book was released at the frankfurt book fair this week .
one letter from gina , a girl from a poor family in berlin , pays testimony to the devotion that hitler could inspire .
" i love you so much , please write to me , " the girl wrote in block capitals .
her father included her letter along with a request for pictures of hitler for his children and proudly announced that gina was determined to marry the nazi leader because he was " the best man in the world . " father figure and ideal partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letters in eberle 's book reflect the enthusiasm felt by many germans many other parents similarly sent pictures of their children , wrote to wish him a merry christmas .
party officials and politicians sent their greetings in cards covered in swastikas .
a small number of jews and jehovah 's witnesses also wrote to hitler , begging him to spare their family members .
there is also a small number of letters from non-germans .
the letters compiled in eberle 's books , which is currently only available in german , begin in 1925 - some seven years before hitler took over power - and end just before his suicide in 1945 .
at the peak of his popularity in 1938 the nazi dictator received 10,000 letters , compared with 200 in 1925 , political barometer eberle , who teaches at martin luther university in the german city of halle , said hitler 's deputy rudolf hess and albert bormann , a close aide , sorted the letters in a bid " to keep hitler informed of the political climate among the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eberle 's book is one of the thousands of new titles being presented at this year 's frankfurt book fair the author told the afp news agency that the book showed german support for hitler increasing in the early 1930s , but also that most correspondents were more concerned with their economic and social well-being than with his policies towards the jews .
" in 1925 , the letters mainly contained advice to hitler , some asking him to be more socialist in his policies , others saying he should expel the jews , " he said .
" but from 1932 , people wanted hitler to become dictator and their fervor for the führer became palpable in the letters . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the missives were found in an archive in moscow . german historian henrik eberle compiled " briefe an hitler " -lrb- " letters to hitler " -rrb- after sifting through more than 20,000 documents war-time documents in the russian state archives .
the book was released at the frankfurt book fair this week .
one letter from gina , a girl from a poor family in berlin , pays testimony to the devotion that hitler could inspire .
" i love you so much , please write to me , " the girl wrote in block capitals .
her father included her letter along with a request for pictures of hitler for his children and proudly announced that gina was determined to marry the nazi leader because he was " the best man in the world . " father figure and ideal partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letters in eberle 's book reflect the enthusiasm felt by many germans many other parents similarly sent pictures of their children , wrote to wish him a merry christmas .
party officials and politicians sent their greetings in cards covered in swastikas .
a small number of jews and jehovah 's witnesses also wrote to hitler , begging him to spare their family members .
there is also a small number of letters from non-germans .
the letters compiled in eberle 's books , which is currently only available in german , begin in 1925 - some seven years before hitler took over power - and end just before his suicide in 1945 .
at the peak of his popularity in 1938 the nazi dictator received 10,000 letters , compared with 200 in 1925 , political barometer eberle , who teaches at martin luther university in the german city of halle , said hitler 's deputy rudolf hess and albert bormann , a close aide , sorted the letters in a bid " to keep hitler informed of the political climate among the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eberle 's book is one of the thousands of new titles being presented at this year 's frankfurt book fair the author told the afp news agency that the book showed german support for hitler increasing in the early 1930s , but also that most correspondents were more concerned with their economic and social well-being than with his policies towards the jews .
" in 1925 , the letters mainly contained advice to hitler , some asking him to be more socialist in his policies , others saying he should expel the jews , " he said .
" but from 1932 , people wanted hitler to become dictator and their fervor for the führer became palpable in the letters . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defense and foreign ministers also disagreed on the state of soviet-era weapons treaty . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the us would move forward with plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , while russia upheld its threat to withdraw from soviet-era arms control treaties if the system was a " unilateral " us project . rice and secretary of defense robert gates were in moscow to " two-plus-two " talks with russian counterparts sergey lavrov and anatoly serdyukov to allay russian fears that the system imperiled russia 's nuclear deterrent . moscow would take measures to " neutralize " the missile threat if it does not assume a " global " character , lavrov told journalists following the talks , interfax reported . " we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.10.2007 opinion : peace prize for gore means little to world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while fighting climate change does play a role in spreading world peace , a nobel peace prize for former us vice president al gore was unnecessary and ill timed , according to dw 's christina bergmann . for some time the nobel prize committee has no longer bestowed its most renowned award on traditional politicians and peacemakers , which is a positive development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase . many german commuters took to the roads on friday , oct .
12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .
the industrial action is a rarity in germany as unions and companies usually work closely to reach collective agreements . half of trains running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters heeded the warnings and drove their cars to work deutsche bahn said because the strike was n't announced until thursday evening , it was unable to implement a comprehensive alternative transport plan .
some long-distance trains have been used for regional transport and extra busses are in service . the railway said 1,700 trains had been cancelled by midday , and the strike would cost " millions " of euros , director of commuter services karl-friedrich rausch told n24 television . about half of the local trains were running friday morning .
about 20 percent of train drivers do not belong to the striking german train drivers ' union , gdl .

gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers . " we would withdraw the 31 percent demand if deutsche bahn discussed a separate agreement , " gdl said thursday . deutsche bahn has refused to negotiate a separate deal from what was agreed with the other two rail unions . deutsche bahn accused of " dishonest means " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl does n't like the deal reached between deutsche bahn and other unions gdl 's claus weselsky said deutsche bahn had illegally threatened strikers with dismissal friday .

the defense and foreign ministers also disagreed on the state of soviet-era weapons treaty . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the us would move forward with plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , while russia upheld its threat to withdraw from soviet-era arms control treaties if the system was a " unilateral " us project . rice and secretary of defense robert gates were in moscow to " two-plus-two " talks with russian counterparts sergey lavrov and anatoly serdyukov to allay russian fears that the system imperiled russia 's nuclear deterrent . moscow would take measures to " neutralize " the missile threat if it does not assume a " global " character , lavrov told journalists following the talks , interfax reported . " we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase . many german commuters took to the roads on friday , oct .
12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .
the industrial action is a rarity in germany as unions and companies usually work closely to reach collective agreements . half of trains running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters heeded the warnings and drove their cars to work deutsche bahn said because the strike was n't announced until thursday evening , it was unable to implement a comprehensive alternative transport plan .
some long-distance trains have been used for regional transport and extra busses are in service . the railway said 1,700 trains had been cancelled by midday , and the strike would cost " millions " of euros , director of commuter services karl-friedrich rausch told n24 television . about half of the local trains were running friday morning .
about 20 percent of train drivers do not belong to the striking german train drivers ' union , gdl .
others conductors are civil servants who not allowed to strike .
long-distance trains are in service , as a court ruling has forbidden their drivers from striking . many of the network 's 10 million daily passengers drove to work , creating traffic jams in major cities , automobile club adac spokesman maxi hartung told german television . union wants one third more pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train drivers ' strike left millions waiting around germany after a meeting thursday evening with gdl chief manfred schell , deutsche bahn boss hartmut mehdorn announced that his company would make a new offer by monday , which he said would put an end to strikes , at least through the end of the month . deutsche bahn has reached a deal with two other unions which allows for a 4.5 percent pay hike and higher pay for longer hours , resulting in a package totaling 10 percent .
gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers . " we would withdraw the 31 percent demand if deutsche bahn discussed a separate agreement , " gdl said thursday . deutsche bahn has refused to negotiate a separate deal from what was agreed with the other two rail unions . deutsche bahn accused of " dishonest means " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl does n't like the deal reached between deutsche bahn and other unions gdl 's claus weselsky said deutsche bahn had illegally threatened strikers with dismissal friday . " for us , the dishonest means with which the employer is attempting to undermine the lawful labor dispute are unacceptable , " weselsky said . deutsche bahn board member karl-friedrich rausch said gdl bore sole responsibility for the " foreseeable chaos " in transport by calling a strike at such short notice . norbert hansen , the head of transnet , one of germany 's other rail unions , said friday that the gdl action was " a totally superfluous strike , " adding that gdl leader schell should have cancelled his strike call pending the new deutsche bahn offer . according to a survey by stern newsmagazine earlier this week , 55 percent of germans sympathize with the strikers despite the inconvenience caused by the strikes . deutsche bahn , which serves 5 million passengers on some 28,000 trains daily , is europe 's largest rail company .

" i am deeply honored to receive the nobel peace prize , " gore said in a statement .
" this award is even more meaningful because i have the honor of sharing it with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ... whose members have worked tirelessly and selflessly for many years . " gore called the fight against climate change " planetary emergency " and a " moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity . " european praise german chancellor angela merkel congratulated gore and ipcc on their shared honor saying it was a triumph for efforts to fight global warming .

he said their efforts to raise awareness about man-made climate change had been " an inspiration for politicians and citizens alike . " barroso also called on all the eu 's partners to see the prize as an encouragement to take swifter and more decisive action on climate change . ipcc head rajendra pachauri said the prize should help the fight against global warming .

friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .

the defense and foreign ministers also disagreed on the state of soviet-era weapons treaty . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the us would move forward with plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , while russia upheld its threat to withdraw from soviet-era arms control treaties if the system was a " unilateral " us project . rice and secretary of defense robert gates were in moscow to " two-plus-two " talks with russian counterparts sergey lavrov and anatoly serdyukov to allay russian fears that the system imperiled russia 's nuclear deterrent . moscow would take measures to " neutralize " the missile threat if it does not assume a " global " character , lavrov told journalists following the talks , interfax reported . " we would like to avoid that , " lavrov added . russian president vladimir putin said earlier this year that he would consider targeting european cities with nuclear weapons if the missile shield deployment went ahead . us : eastern europe key to missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice could n't find much common ground with her russian counterpart the us missile plan calls for installing a radar station in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland .
both countries , which used to be in the soviet sphere of influence , are now european union and nato members . the us had reviewed putin 's proposal to allow the use of russian missile tracking facilities in azerbaijan and southern russia , but said these could not substitute for the system in eastern europe . putin also told rice and gates it would be " difficult " for russia to remain in the 1987 us-russian intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- unless it was expanded to include other countries . russia : bilateral treaty a security threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin opposes us plans for missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic " if we are unable to make such a goal of making this treaty universal , then it will be difficult for us to keep within the framework of such a treaty , especially when other countries do have such weapons systems and among those are countries in our near vicinity , " said putin . the inf treaty bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , with growing arsenals . rice and gates are in russia for two days of talks on a range of issues including us missile defense plans and russia 's threatened withdrawal from another cold war-era treaty , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
this limits the number of troops and tanks stationed in europe . talks on many prickly subjects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says there is no evidence that iran is developing a bomb the two sides also discussed iran 's nuclear program , the status of kosovo , and proposals to renew the cold war start strategic missile treaty .
the start treaty , on strategic nuclear weapons , expires in 2009 .
washington says it does not plan to extend it , prompting russian concerns about what will replace it . analysts say that russia 's threat to withdraw from the inf treaty is designed to strengthen its hand in strategic talks with the us . simon saradzhyan , an independent analyst in moscow , told the reuters news agency : " in the short-term this is a bargaining chip in the negotiations on the broader agenda of arms control , including whether the start treaty will be extended and the future of the cfe treaty . " " in the medium term russia would like to have more adequate tools in its tool box for the deterrence of its neighbors , which unlike russia have a free hand in acquiring medium-range conventional missiles .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

a small number of jews and jehovah 's witnesses also wrote to hitler , begging him to spare their family members .
there is also a small number of letters from non-germans .
the letters compiled in eberle 's books , which is currently only available in german , begin in 1925 - some seven years before hitler took over power - and end just before his suicide in 1945 .
at the peak of his popularity in 1938 the nazi dictator received 10,000 letters , compared with 200 in 1925 , political barometer eberle , who teaches at martin luther university in the german city of halle , said hitler 's deputy rudolf hess and albert bormann , a close aide , sorted the letters in a bid " to keep hitler informed of the political climate among the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eberle 's book is one of the thousands of new titles being presented at this year 's frankfurt book fair the author told the afp news agency that the book showed german support for hitler increasing in the early 1930s , but also that most correspondents were more concerned with their economic and social well-being than with his policies towards the jews .
" in 1925 , the letters mainly contained advice to hitler , some asking him to be more socialist in his policies , others saying he should expel the jews , " he said .
" but from 1932 , people wanted hitler to become dictator and their fervor for the führer became palpable in the letters . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase . many german commuters took to the roads on friday , oct .
12 , while others were forced to wait for one of the few trains still running . germany 's eastern states , as well as munich , stuttgart and berlin , are most affected by the strike , which began at 2 a.m.
friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .
the industrial action is a rarity in germany as unions and companies usually work closely to reach collective agreements . half of trains running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters heeded the warnings and drove their cars to work deutsche bahn said because the strike was n't announced until thursday evening , it was unable to implement a comprehensive alternative transport plan .
some long-distance trains have been used for regional transport and extra busses are in service . the railway said 1,700 trains had been cancelled by midday , and the strike would cost " millions " of euros , director of commuter services karl-friedrich rausch told n24 television . about half of the local trains were running friday morning .
about 20 percent of train drivers do not belong to the striking german train drivers ' union , gdl .
others conductors are civil servants who not allowed to strike .
long-distance trains are in service , as a court ruling has forbidden their drivers from striking . many of the network 's 10 million daily passengers drove to work , creating traffic jams in major cities , automobile club adac spokesman maxi hartung told german television . union wants one third more pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train drivers ' strike left millions waiting around germany after a meeting thursday evening with gdl chief manfred schell , deutsche bahn boss hartmut mehdorn announced that his company would make a new offer by monday , which he said would put an end to strikes , at least through the end of the month . deutsche bahn has reached a deal with two other unions which allows for a 4.5 percent pay hike and higher pay for longer hours , resulting in a package totaling 10 percent .
gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers . " we would withdraw the 31 percent demand if deutsche bahn discussed a separate agreement , " gdl said thursday . deutsche bahn has refused to negotiate a separate deal from what was agreed with the other two rail unions . deutsche bahn accused of " dishonest means " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl does n't like the deal reached between deutsche bahn and other unions gdl 's claus weselsky said deutsche bahn had illegally threatened strikers with dismissal friday . " for us , the dishonest means with which the employer is attempting to undermine the lawful labor dispute are unacceptable , " weselsky said . deutsche bahn board member karl-friedrich rausch said gdl bore sole responsibility for the " foreseeable chaos " in transport by calling a strike at such short notice . norbert hansen , the head of transnet , one of germany 's other rail unions , said friday that the gdl action was " a totally superfluous strike , " adding that gdl leader schell should have cancelled his strike call pending the new deutsche bahn offer . according to a survey by stern newsmagazine earlier this week , 55 percent of germans sympathize with the strikers despite the inconvenience caused by the strikes . deutsche bahn , which serves 5 million passengers on some 28,000 trains daily , is europe 's largest rail company .

friday morning , a deutsche bahn spokesperson told associated press . manfred schell , the head of the gdl union , which represents 1,500 train drivers , called the strike " a complete success " with some 85 percent of targeted trains not running . the strike , which follows last friday 's three-hour labor action , is set to continue until midnight .

gdl has rejected the deal and continued to demand a 31 percent increase in pay and separately negotiated contracts for drivers .

12 .
eu president barroso called them an " inspiration . " gore and the ipcc were cited " for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change , and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change , " the norwegian nobel committee said . " i am deeply honored to receive the nobel peace prize , " gore said in a statement .
" this award is even more meaningful because i have the honor of sharing it with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ... whose members have worked tirelessly and selflessly for many years . " gore called the fight against climate change " planetary emergency " and a " moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity . " european praise german chancellor angela merkel congratulated gore and ipcc on their shared honor saying it was a triumph for efforts to fight global warming . " the dangers of climate change are among humanity 's biggest challenges , " said merkel , who has also earned a reputation as green campaigner after convincing the usa at june 's g8 summit to commit , in principle , to cutting carbon emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore worked to raise public awareness of climate change in the film " an inconvenient truth " " al gore has contributed for years like no other to increase global awareness of the need to develop strong , effective strategies against climate changes , " she said in a statement on her government web site . european commission president jose manuel barroso congratulated the winners .
he said their efforts to raise awareness about man-made climate change had been " an inspiration for politicians and citizens alike . " barroso also called on all the eu 's partners to see the prize as an encouragement to take swifter and more decisive action on climate change . ipcc head rajendra pachauri said the prize should help the fight against global warming . " i expect this will bring the subject to the fore and will hopefully create greater awareness and a sense of urgency , " he said . " i am just a symbol .
it 's my organization and the efforts the organization has put in , " he said . making climate change understandable the ipcc was founded in 1988 to investigate the risks of global warming .
the body was tasked with gathering , assessing and presenting scientific data on climate change in an understandable format . the ipcc was set up by the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- and the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- . based in geneva , the panel has so far published three comprehensive reports on climate change , in 1990 , 1995 and 2001 .
the body does not conduct its own scientific research , but pulls together scientific and technical studies released over the period between reports . increasing certainty of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc said human activity is clearly related to climate change the ipcc reports examine the scientific basis for global warming and how changes are affecting the environment and society , as well as offering strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change . the fundamental conclusions of the researchers have been the same throughout , though the certainty attributed to them has increased : humans are exacerbating the greenhouse effect , are heating up the planet with untold consequences and must make a determined effort to counteract climate change . some 2,500 researchers and 450 main authors have worked on the fourth assessment report for the past six years . the nobel prize , worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.1 million euros -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.10.2007 opinion : peace prize for gore means little to world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while fighting climate change does play a role in spreading world peace , a nobel peace prize for former us vice president al gore was unnecessary and ill timed , according to dw 's christina bergmann . for some time the nobel prize committee has no longer bestowed its most renowned award on traditional politicians and peacemakers , which is a positive development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy has recognized that , for example , the fight against poverty also serves peace .
in this respect , it is logical to dedicate this year 's prize to those who have called attention to the effects of worldwide climate change .
the distinction for the un 's climate panel is completely justified .
that the nobel committee awarded former us vice president al gore with a medal as well is unnecessary and , most importantly , has occurred at the wrong time .
to honor the man who in the usa is either hated or celebrated like a pop star diverts attention from the topic .
even if the nobel committee did n't intend it to be , the prize is also a slap in the face to current president george w. bush , who won the 2000 election .
had gore been elected president , the usa would certainly be among those who signed the kyoto protocol .
additionally , the war in iraq would either have not taken place or , at least , would not have proceeded as it has under bush .
the nobel committee must have also noticed that many americans would like to see al gore in the running for the next presidency , which he can still enter .
there is also a danger that the facts disappear behind the hype surrounding the man .
does anyone remember the oscar award ceremony for the movie " an inconvenient truth " ?
the film deals with the world and global warming but mainly with al gore .
without him the film would have been just one of many .
but it 's the film with which gore became famous - and which can now only be shown in schools in great britain when attention is brought to nine mistakes the film presents .
to be fair , one also has to say that al gore has done a service to the topic of global warming in the united states .
americans are in dire need of someone to explain to them that not every trip requires a car and that insulated homes help save energy .
still , is that enough for a nobel peace prize ?
the rest of the world has moved much further and does n't need al gore to explain the dangers of climate change to them .
there is reason enough to assume that al gore will use the political capital the nobel prize brings primarily to promote his pr campaign against climate change .
gore has said he is not interested in running for president , and the nobel prize committee should hope he sticks to his word .
otherwise it has let itself be exploited by a politician for personal reasons in a way that can not be justified .

riders have been taking monthly trips around the seaside town for more than a year to highlight their cause .
but during their latest ride involving about 15 cyclists , they claim they were verbally abused and their safety was put at risk by angry drivers .
police said they did not take intimidation of road users lightly .
cyclist kelvin mason , of beic grwp -lrb- bike group -rrb- , said the monthly foray around aberystwyth , known as the critical mass ride , was " law-abiding and friendly " .
but he added that cycling at present in the town was difficult , dangerous and discouraged .
" we carry signs informing people what we are doing and we stop regularly to allow any tailback of traffic to pass , giving drivers a friendly wave , " explained mr mason .
" during the last ride we were assailed with the foulest verbal abuse from some motorists .
' intimidation ' " moreover , a number of drivers deliberately drove in a way that not only frightened and intimidated cyclists but put us at real risk of serious injury .
" this level of harassment has , i believe , gone beyond the stage of reporting individual drivers to the police , reports that the police are anyway reluctant to take or follow up upon . "
dyfed-powys police urged cyclists to take " every safety precaution " before taking to the roads .
" when it comes to drivers on the road we would ask that consideration is shown to all vulnerable road users and when overtaking cyclists to give them plenty of room , " said a force spokesman .
" any driver or rider that does not drive or ride in accordance with the law will be dealt with and we will not take intimidation of road users lightly . "
the force added that police were not reluctant to follow up such incidents , but cases had to be reported and there had to be sufficient evidence to support a prosecution .
ceredigion council said improved cycle lanes had been mentioned as part of a study of aberystwyth .
a spokeswoman said : " the provision of improved cycling facilities within the town and its approaches has been raised as part of the masterplan consultation .
" this will not necessarily mean the provision of exclusive cycle lanes for there simply is n't the space to provide these on the majority of the roads within the town centre . "
the next critical mass ride is on 26 october .

riders have been taking monthly trips around the seaside town for more than a year to highlight their cause .
but during their latest ride involving about 15 cyclists , they claim they were verbally abused and their safety was put at risk by angry drivers .
police said they did not take intimidation of road users lightly .
cyclist kelvin mason , of beic grwp -lrb- bike group -rrb- , said the monthly foray around aberystwyth , known as the critical mass ride , was " law-abiding and friendly " .
but he added that cycling at present in the town was difficult , dangerous and discouraged .
" we carry signs informing people what we are doing and we stop regularly to allow any tailback of traffic to pass , giving drivers a friendly wave , " explained mr mason .
" during the last ride we were assailed with the foulest verbal abuse from some motorists .
' intimidation ' " moreover , a number of drivers deliberately drove in a way that not only frightened and intimidated cyclists but put us at real risk of serious injury .
" this level of harassment has , i believe , gone beyond the stage of reporting individual drivers to the police , reports that the police are anyway reluctant to take or follow up upon . "
dyfed-powys police urged cyclists to take " every safety precaution " before taking to the roads .
" when it comes to drivers on the road we would ask that consideration is shown to all vulnerable road users and when overtaking cyclists to give them plenty of room , " said a force spokesman .
" any driver or rider that does not drive or ride in accordance with the law will be dealt with and we will not take intimidation of road users lightly . "
the force added that police were not reluctant to follow up such incidents , but cases had to be reported and there had to be sufficient evidence to support a prosecution .
ceredigion council said improved cycle lanes had been mentioned as part of a study of aberystwyth .
a spokeswoman said : " the provision of improved cycling facilities within the town and its approaches has been raised as part of the masterplan consultation .
" this will not necessarily mean the provision of exclusive cycle lanes for there simply is n't the space to provide these on the majority of the roads within the town centre . "
the next critical mass ride is on 26 october .

while many consider them an eyesore , in the town where the entrepreneur is king , there are always new ways to make money and using other people 's rubbish is one way to do it .
streets not paved with gold - but potentially valuable rubbish the underground market in recycling has become such big business now that some people are taking other people 's rubbish in an effort to make money .
in the middle of the night , entrepreneurs , or thieves as the city calls them , arrive to stock up on recyclables .
city officials say it is stealing , and are introducing fines of up to $ 2,000 -lrb- £ 1,000 -rrb- for anyone caught taking trash .
valuable junk city councilman michael mcmahon , chairman of the council 's sanitation committee , says that material left out on the kerb is the property of the city of new york .
" it 's not just some silly rubbish - the junk has value , and paper in particular pays for the collection of the glass and plastics , " he says .
" without that , we do n't have recycling - it 's money that 's used to help the city run its recycling programme . "
the city noticed the amount of paper and cardboard that was being recycled had dropped over the past year by as much as 25 % in some parts of the city .
enough rubbish for everyone ?
mr mcmahon says the city might be losing as much as 15,000 tons of paper a year from manhattan alone .
" as the tonnages were going down , the city was losing $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 a year , " he says .
residents of the wealthy upper east side noticed the thefts , but many remain unconcerned .
" i 've seen them , " says one evening dog-walker .
" they come in and take the cardboard out .
i do n't think of them as thieves , they 're earning a living .
i mean , they 're helping themselves .
i think there 's enough garbage around here for everybody . "
it is a view shared by many other local residents .
" i do n't see why the city is complaining .
if these people have the guts to go around picking it up , god bless ' em , " says one man .
" i 've heard about it , " says another woman .
" i thought it was the things they could sell more easily , but if they take this , it saves the city having to do it .
if the city are complaining , they ought to pick it up more often ! "
' hard job ' the city says paper is worth about $ 20 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- a tonne .
john dardy , commissioner for new york 's department of sanitation , denies the city is being greedy .
mike sterling makes money collecting cans " it 's easy for them to make a buck or two at night because they can take the large piles of paper outside office buildings and apartments .
if we go out anticipating that the paper is going to be out there , we 've spent money to put that truck on the street . "
the city has now passed a bill that would raise the fine for anyone caught stealing rubbish from $ 100 to $ 2,000 .
but there is a loophole - you can only be prosecuted if you 're taking home the trash in your car or van .
anyone using a shopping trolley , like many of the city 's 30,000 homeless people , can take as much as they like .
mike sterling is one of those who pushes a shopping cart the city 's streets , and he is aware that this new law will leave his collecting habit untouched .
" it does n't have anything to do with a guy like me just trying to walk along and make a few bucks .
it 's a hard job , but one has to do what one has to do . "
mike makes about $ 12 -lrb- £ 6 -rrb- a day collecting 250 cans from the bins , and proves somewhat that in this city of eight million people , there really is enough rubbish for everyone .

while many consider them an eyesore , in the town where the entrepreneur is king , there are always new ways to make money and using other people 's rubbish is one way to do it .
streets not paved with gold - but potentially valuable rubbish the underground market in recycling has become such big business now that some people are taking other people 's rubbish in an effort to make money .
in the middle of the night , entrepreneurs , or thieves as the city calls them , arrive to stock up on recyclables .
city officials say it is stealing , and are introducing fines of up to $ 2,000 -lrb- £ 1,000 -rrb- for anyone caught taking trash .
valuable junk city councilman michael mcmahon , chairman of the council 's sanitation committee , says that material left out on the kerb is the property of the city of new york .
" it 's not just some silly rubbish - the junk has value , and paper in particular pays for the collection of the glass and plastics , " he says .
" without that , we do n't have recycling - it 's money that 's used to help the city run its recycling programme . "
the city noticed the amount of paper and cardboard that was being recycled had dropped over the past year by as much as 25 % in some parts of the city .
enough rubbish for everyone ?
mr mcmahon says the city might be losing as much as 15,000 tons of paper a year from manhattan alone .
" as the tonnages were going down , the city was losing $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 a year , " he says .
residents of the wealthy upper east side noticed the thefts , but many remain unconcerned .
" i 've seen them , " says one evening dog-walker .
" they come in and take the cardboard out .
i do n't think of them as thieves , they 're earning a living .
i mean , they 're helping themselves .
i think there 's enough garbage around here for everybody . "
it is a view shared by many other local residents .
" i do n't see why the city is complaining .
if these people have the guts to go around picking it up , god bless ' em , " says one man .
" i 've heard about it , " says another woman .
" i thought it was the things they could sell more easily , but if they take this , it saves the city having to do it .
if the city are complaining , they ought to pick it up more often ! "
' hard job ' the city says paper is worth about $ 20 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- a tonne .
john dardy , commissioner for new york 's department of sanitation , denies the city is being greedy .

the cambridge-based primary review 's report said the pressure of sats tests dominated the last two primary years .
researchers ran 87 discussions with groups of children , parents , teachers and others ; 750 people took part .
the government said most children lived in better conditions than 10 years ago and rejected criticism of testing .
primary review director professor robin alexander told bbc radio 4 's today programme that young children faced a range of pressures .

"
he also talked about the values children are subjected to , such as consumerism , individualism and materialism .
but he added that every generation had its stresses and some children had endured " unimaginable hardships " .
climate concerns among those quoted in the primary review report are children themselves .
children thought sats tests were " scary " , the report said many expressed concern about climate change , global warming and pollution , the gulf between rich and poor , and terrorism .
" some were also worried by the gloomy tenor of ' what you hear on the news ' or by a generalised fear of strangers , burglars and street violence , " the report said .
but it added : " where schools had started engaging children with global and local realities as aspects of their education they were noticeably more upbeat . "
the children thought sats tests " scary " but felt the results informed people about how they were doing .

" the vast majority of children go to better schools , enjoy better health , live in better housing and in more affluent households than they did 10 years ago .
" the government does not share the view that children are over-tested .

the cambridge-based primary review 's report said the pressure of sats tests dominated the last two primary years .
researchers ran 87 discussions with groups of children , parents , teachers and others ; 750 people took part .
the government said most children lived in better conditions than 10 years ago and rejected criticism of testing .

but he added that every generation had its stresses and some children had endured " unimaginable hardships " .
climate concerns among those quoted in the primary review report are children themselves .
children thought sats tests were " scary " , the report said many expressed concern about climate change , global warming and pollution , the gulf between rich and poor , and terrorism .
" some were also worried by the gloomy tenor of ' what you hear on the news ' or by a generalised fear of strangers , burglars and street violence , " the report said .

the kent and sussex hospital is run by an nhs trust whose " poor handling " of the infection resulted in 90 deaths , according to the healthcare commission .
the hospital 's league of friends said it had to provide commodes , fans and other equipment for an isolation ward .
the trust said it was sorry if it had placed an " undue burden " on the group .
the kent and sussex , at tunbridge wells , is one of three hospitals run by maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust , which was heavily criticised in the healthcare commission 's report on thursday .
clostridium difficile , a bacterial infection of the gut , causes severe diarrhoea .
league of friends committee member peter coppins said it had spent £ 5,634 on commodes and storage racks , fans and a hoist for the hargraves ward used to isolate victims .
some of the friends ' funding two patient trolleys for icu - £ 16,907 two plaster couches - £ 3,319 vital signs monitor - £ 4,740 paediatric infusion pump - £ 3,108 four tournique machines - £ 4,000 examination couch - £ 3,169 " we had to buy the commodes because they had n't got enough , " he said .
" then we had to buy a hoist because when people went to the toilet and fell over the nursing staff were n't able to lift them up .
" because of the unpleasant odours caused by c.diff the nursing staff were faced with going into a vile-smelling environment .
" the fans were used just to get some fresh air circulating . "
the items for hargraves were among a £ 64,318 shopping list approved by the league in june which included items such as an examination couch and tourniquet machines .
" it is very difficult indeed - we are in an onerous position , " said mr coppins .
" our remit is to provide comfort for patients but we have been buying quite a lot of equipment which is really capital equipment . "
commodes for the isolation ward were among the items purchased the kent and sussex and the trust 's pembury hospital are to be replaced by a new £ 226m private-finance scheme building due to open by 2011 .
the healthcare commission 's report said the nhs trust had a fixation with meeting financial targets and mr coppins said the league believed the pressures of the new hospital project contributed to this .
" the situation has arisen because the hospital is trying to get out of deficit - that is their big problem .
" we can all see it but i think it is wrong that these items should not be purchased by the trust . "
the trust said in a statement it was very grateful to the league of friends and would not knowingly upset their close bond .
" we would only accept items the league is happy to provide , " it said .
" we do not expect the league to buy essential items of equipment but fully appreciate their help . "
