program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.07.2007 sarkozy rocks eu boat with controversial economic ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has riled up some in the eu with his cocky style french president nicolas sarkozy is stirring up the eu with controversial economic proposals and attacks on the european central bank 's monetary policies .
critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .

in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .

experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .

the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.07.2007 putin makes good on threats , pulls russia out of arms treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's decision to leave the treaty will allow russia to move its troops without inspection russian president vladimir putin made true on earlier warnings to withdraw russia 's participation from the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- on saturday . president putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty effective immediately , the kremlin said in a statement saturday .
while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .

scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.07.2007 putin makes good on threats , pulls russia out of arms treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's decision to leave the treaty will allow russia to move its troops without inspection russian president vladimir putin made true on earlier warnings to withdraw russia 's participation from the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- on saturday . president putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty effective immediately , the kremlin said in a statement saturday .
while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .
german anti-nuclear groups have demanded that the company 's nuclear license be revoked .

in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .
german anti-nuclear groups have demanded that the company 's nuclear license be revoked .
under current legislation , all germany 's nuclear power plants are to close by 2021 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .

president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .

the eu executive underlined that access to services at affordable prices for the less well-off was also improving .
" the eu 's policy of opening the telecoms , transport and other network industries to competition has been the right one , since this has made them more competitive by putting downward pressure on prices without compromising either the service or its quality , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
he urged more liberalization , however , saying further action was needed to open so-far state-protected industries to internal and foreign competition .
eu fighting to open up more competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air travel is booming the commission is fighting hard to open up the bloc 's network industries , with the focus on telecommunications , postal services , electricity , gas , air , road and rail transport , which together account for around 8 per cent of the bloc 's value added and employ more than 10 million people .
eu officials said regulatory changes in network industries had created the conditions for the emergence of more competitive markets , with new and better products on offer .
" people are flying as never before " as the number of direct flight routes connecting european cities doubled since 1992 , said eu spokeswoman amelia torres .
also prices in these sectors had fallen over the last decade , in particular in the telecommunications and air transport sectors , she said .
same bonuses to come in time in the energy sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a liberalized energy sector gets the thumbs up from barroso the commission admitted that benefits were less visible in the energy sector because the liberalization process was more recent and because of the steep increase in oil and gas prices worldwide since 2004 .
the eu executive also complained that some governments were not correctly implementing the regulatory framework legislation in the energy sector .
productivity in network industries has grown faster than in the rest of the economy , the commission said , adding that this was often accompanied by employment growth .
furthermore , in many countries the number of jobs created by new entrants in the telecommunications sector , for example , greatly outnumbered the job losses at the incumbent companies .
the commission report comes at a time when france in particular is voicing increased opposition to across-the-board economic liberalization , with french president nicolas sarkozy instead putting the emphasis on so-called " economic patriotism . "
sarkozy succeeded last month in persuading other eu leaders to remove a reference in the bloc 's planned " reform treaty " to the need for " free and fair competition " in eu industries , a move which many in the bloc fear will slash commission powers in the sector .
but eu officials including almunia and commission competition chief neelie kroes have said this will not curb their drive to liberalize europe 's economic sectors . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.07.2007 sarkozy rocks eu boat with controversial economic ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has riled up some in the eu with his cocky style french president nicolas sarkozy is stirring up the eu with controversial economic proposals and attacks on the european central bank 's monetary policies .
critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .

the film crew has been banned from the berlin building , now a memorial site , where the plotter , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , was executed by nazi firing squad .
officials have said allowing filming at the site would lower the dignity of the memorial , but german politicians had earlier assailed cruise , 45 , over his advocacy of scientology and demanded he be banned from the memorial .
scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .
us commentators , cinema industry leaders and part of the media have attacked the ban , insisting cruise 's beliefs should have no relevance to his role in director bryan singer 's movie " valkyrie . "

hitler , however , survived the blast and within days many of those involved in the attempts on his life were rounded up and executed .
the scene was being recreated in woods at gross köris , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south-east of berlin .
reporters were unable to see the set , with the site sealed off by private security teams , roadblocks and miles of red-and-white tape . " in consideration of our film 's historical background , germany was the only location where the filming of ' valkyrie ' could take place , " said paula wagner , ceo of united artists , one of the film 's co-producers .
filming , partly funded by a german government grant , is scheduled to begin july 19 , according to ulrich arnts , chief executive of the schenkenländchen district administration .
stauffenberg is revered in germany as a national hero for his july 20 , 1944 bid to kill hitler , but leading german journalist frank schirrmacher has pointed out that the count had anti-democratic beliefs .
film details kept under lock and key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany have said cruise 's belief in scientology should prohibit him from the role studio babelsberg , the german movie studio which is co-producing " valkyrie , " declined to give details of the script .
" cruise views stauffenberg as a hero and will play him that way , " said christoph fisser , the studio 's deputy chief executive , adding that the script that been carefully researched .
reporters said cruise has already been sighted in berlin .
city newspapers say a huge suite was created in a luxury downtown hotel especially for cruise and wife katie holmes . film publicists declined to confirm this .
in schenkenländchen , arnts said two other nearby locations were also being prepared for filming : a former east german air force reserve airfield and an area of recently burned-over forest .
at the airfield at löpten , warning signs said only that the airfield would be in use for takeoffs and landings and there was no word of filming .
the project , reportedly also to star kenneth branagh , carice van houten , thomas kretschmann , christian berkel and tom wilkinson , is reported to cost 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .
while europe is reliant on russian energy , moscow depends on energy sales in europe and needs european investments in its natural-gas sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 14.07.2007 eu : consumers pay less for services in liberalized sectors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no wonder consumers in the eu are so happy - they 've never had it so good consumers in the european union are reaping the benefits of lower prices as network industries across the 27-nation bloc open up to free competition , the european commission said friday . the performance of network industries , such as telecommunications , transport and energy , has continued to improve as competition puts pressure on service providers to keep their costs and prices down , the commission said .
the eu executive underlined that access to services at affordable prices for the less well-off was also improving .
" the eu 's policy of opening the telecoms , transport and other network industries to competition has been the right one , since this has made them more competitive by putting downward pressure on prices without compromising either the service or its quality , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
he urged more liberalization , however , saying further action was needed to open so-far state-protected industries to internal and foreign competition .
eu fighting to open up more competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air travel is booming the commission is fighting hard to open up the bloc 's network industries , with the focus on telecommunications , postal services , electricity , gas , air , road and rail transport , which together account for around 8 per cent of the bloc 's value added and employ more than 10 million people .
eu officials said regulatory changes in network industries had created the conditions for the emergence of more competitive markets , with new and better products on offer .
" people are flying as never before " as the number of direct flight routes connecting european cities doubled since 1992 , said eu spokeswoman amelia torres .
also prices in these sectors had fallen over the last decade , in particular in the telecommunications and air transport sectors , she said .
same bonuses to come in time in the energy sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a liberalized energy sector gets the thumbs up from barroso the commission admitted that benefits were less visible in the energy sector because the liberalization process was more recent and because of the steep increase in oil and gas prices worldwide since 2004 .
the eu executive also complained that some governments were not correctly implementing the regulatory framework legislation in the energy sector .
productivity in network industries has grown faster than in the rest of the economy , the commission said , adding that this was often accompanied by employment growth .
furthermore , in many countries the number of jobs created by new entrants in the telecommunications sector , for example , greatly outnumbered the job losses at the incumbent companies .
the commission report comes at a time when france in particular is voicing increased opposition to across-the-board economic liberalization , with french president nicolas sarkozy instead putting the emphasis on so-called " economic patriotism . "
sarkozy succeeded last month in persuading other eu leaders to remove a reference in the bloc 's planned " reform treaty " to the need for " free and fair competition " in eu industries , a move which many in the bloc fear will slash commission powers in the sector .
but eu officials including almunia and commission competition chief neelie kroes have said this will not curb their drive to liberalize europe 's economic sectors . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the film crew has been banned from the berlin building , now a memorial site , where the plotter , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , was executed by nazi firing squad .
officials have said allowing filming at the site would lower the dignity of the memorial , but german politicians had earlier assailed cruise , 45 , over his advocacy of scientology and demanded he be banned from the memorial .
scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .
us commentators , cinema industry leaders and part of the media have attacked the ban , insisting cruise 's beliefs should have no relevance to his role in director bryan singer 's movie " valkyrie . "

hitler , however , survived the blast and within days many of those involved in the attempts on his life were rounded up and executed .
the scene was being recreated in woods at gross köris , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south-east of berlin .
reporters were unable to see the set , with the site sealed off by private security teams , roadblocks and miles of red-and-white tape . " in consideration of our film 's historical background , germany was the only location where the filming of ' valkyrie ' could take place , " said paula wagner , ceo of united artists , one of the film 's co-producers .
filming , partly funded by a german government grant , is scheduled to begin july 19 , according to ulrich arnts , chief executive of the schenkenländchen district administration .
stauffenberg is revered in germany as a national hero for his july 20 , 1944 bid to kill hitler , but leading german journalist frank schirrmacher has pointed out that the count had anti-democratic beliefs .
film details kept under lock and key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany have said cruise 's belief in scientology should prohibit him from the role studio babelsberg , the german movie studio which is co-producing " valkyrie , " declined to give details of the script .
" cruise views stauffenberg as a hero and will play him that way , " said christoph fisser , the studio 's deputy chief executive , adding that the script that been carefully researched .
reporters said cruise has already been sighted in berlin .
city newspapers say a huge suite was created in a luxury downtown hotel especially for cruise and wife katie holmes . film publicists declined to confirm this .
in schenkenländchen , arnts said two other nearby locations were also being prepared for filming : a former east german air force reserve airfield and an area of recently burned-over forest .
at the airfield at löpten , warning signs said only that the airfield would be in use for takeoffs and landings and there was no word of filming .
the project , reportedly also to star kenneth branagh , carice van houten , thomas kretschmann , christian berkel and tom wilkinson , is reported to cost 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.07.2007 sarkozy rocks eu boat with controversial economic ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has riled up some in the eu with his cocky style french president nicolas sarkozy is stirring up the eu with controversial economic proposals and attacks on the european central bank 's monetary policies .
critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .
german anti-nuclear groups have demanded that the company 's nuclear license be revoked .

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 14.07.2007 divided eu struggles to forge close ties with assertive russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over the best way to engage moscow european union policymakers say dealing with an increasingly assertive , energy-rich russia is the 27-nation bloc 's biggest foreign-policy challenge . relations between europe and russia contain a " level of misunderstanding or even mistrust we have not seen since the end of the cold war , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said recently .
javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .
while europe is reliant on russian energy , moscow depends on energy sales in europe and needs european investments in its natural-gas sector .
eu and nato officials admit that dealing with russia will be difficult in the months leading to the spring 2008 presidential election that will determine putin 's replacement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.07.2007 putin makes good on threats , pulls russia out of arms treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's decision to leave the treaty will allow russia to move its troops without inspection russian president vladimir putin made true on earlier warnings to withdraw russia 's participation from the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- on saturday . president putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty effective immediately , the kremlin said in a statement saturday .
while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .

but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .

in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .

the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .
while europe is reliant on russian energy , moscow depends on energy sales in europe and needs european investments in its natural-gas sector .

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .
while europe is reliant on russian energy , moscow depends on energy sales in europe and needs european investments in its natural-gas sector .
eu and nato officials admit that dealing with russia will be difficult in the months leading to the spring 2008 presidential election that will determine putin 's replacement .

in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .

vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .
german anti-nuclear groups have demanded that the company 's nuclear license be revoked .

prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .

vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .
german anti-nuclear groups have demanded that the company 's nuclear license be revoked .
under current legislation , all germany 's nuclear power plants are to close by 2021 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.07.2007 putin makes good on threats , pulls russia out of arms treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's decision to leave the treaty will allow russia to move its troops without inspection russian president vladimir putin made true on earlier warnings to withdraw russia 's participation from the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- on saturday . president putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty effective immediately , the kremlin said in a statement saturday .
while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .

the film crew has been banned from the berlin building , now a memorial site , where the plotter , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , was executed by nazi firing squad .
officials have said allowing filming at the site would lower the dignity of the memorial , but german politicians had earlier assailed cruise , 45 , over his advocacy of scientology and demanded he be banned from the memorial .
scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .
us commentators , cinema industry leaders and part of the media have attacked the ban , insisting cruise 's beliefs should have no relevance to his role in director bryan singer 's movie " valkyrie . "
replicas being built outside berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's office at wolf 's lair after the assassination attempt stauffenberg put a bomb under a table in a building at wolfsschanze , or wolf 's lair , hitler 's secret base in the woods near what is ketrzyn in contemporary poland .
hitler , however , survived the blast and within days many of those involved in the attempts on his life were rounded up and executed .
the scene was being recreated in woods at gross köris , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south-east of berlin .
reporters were unable to see the set , with the site sealed off by private security teams , roadblocks and miles of red-and-white tape . " in consideration of our film 's historical background , germany was the only location where the filming of ' valkyrie ' could take place , " said paula wagner , ceo of united artists , one of the film 's co-producers .
filming , partly funded by a german government grant , is scheduled to begin july 19 , according to ulrich arnts , chief executive of the schenkenländchen district administration .
stauffenberg is revered in germany as a national hero for his july 20 , 1944 bid to kill hitler , but leading german journalist frank schirrmacher has pointed out that the count had anti-democratic beliefs .
film details kept under lock and key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany have said cruise 's belief in scientology should prohibit him from the role studio babelsberg , the german movie studio which is co-producing " valkyrie , " declined to give details of the script .

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu executive underlined that access to services at affordable prices for the less well-off was also improving .
" the eu 's policy of opening the telecoms , transport and other network industries to competition has been the right one , since this has made them more competitive by putting downward pressure on prices without compromising either the service or its quality , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
he urged more liberalization , however , saying further action was needed to open so-far state-protected industries to internal and foreign competition .

eu officials said regulatory changes in network industries had created the conditions for the emergence of more competitive markets , with new and better products on offer .
" people are flying as never before " as the number of direct flight routes connecting european cities doubled since 1992 , said eu spokeswoman amelia torres .

the eu executive also complained that some governments were not correctly implementing the regulatory framework legislation in the energy sector .
productivity in network industries has grown faster than in the rest of the economy , the commission said , adding that this was often accompanied by employment growth .
furthermore , in many countries the number of jobs created by new entrants in the telecommunications sector , for example , greatly outnumbered the job losses at the incumbent companies .
the commission report comes at a time when france in particular is voicing increased opposition to across-the-board economic liberalization , with french president nicolas sarkozy instead putting the emphasis on so-called " economic patriotism . "

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .

as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .

the film crew has been banned from the berlin building , now a memorial site , where the plotter , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , was executed by nazi firing squad .
officials have said allowing filming at the site would lower the dignity of the memorial , but german politicians had earlier assailed cruise , 45 , over his advocacy of scientology and demanded he be banned from the memorial .
scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .
us commentators , cinema industry leaders and part of the media have attacked the ban , insisting cruise 's beliefs should have no relevance to his role in director bryan singer 's movie " valkyrie . "

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .
while europe is reliant on russian energy , moscow depends on energy sales in europe and needs european investments in its natural-gas sector .

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.07.2007 putin makes good on threats , pulls russia out of arms treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's decision to leave the treaty will allow russia to move its troops without inspection russian president vladimir putin made true on earlier warnings to withdraw russia 's participation from the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- on saturday . president putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty effective immediately , the kremlin said in a statement saturday .
while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .

in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .

russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.07.2007 putin makes good on threats , pulls russia out of arms treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's decision to leave the treaty will allow russia to move its troops without inspection russian president vladimir putin made true on earlier warnings to withdraw russia 's participation from the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- on saturday . president putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty effective immediately , the kremlin said in a statement saturday .
while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .

reporters said cruise has already been sighted in berlin .
city newspapers say a huge suite was created in a luxury downtown hotel especially for cruise and wife katie holmes . film publicists declined to confirm this .
in schenkenländchen , arnts said two other nearby locations were also being prepared for filming : a former east german air force reserve airfield and an area of recently burned-over forest .
at the airfield at löpten , warning signs said only that the airfield would be in use for takeoffs and landings and there was no word of filming .

the film crew has been banned from the berlin building , now a memorial site , where the plotter , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , was executed by nazi firing squad .
officials have said allowing filming at the site would lower the dignity of the memorial , but german politicians had earlier assailed cruise , 45 , over his advocacy of scientology and demanded he be banned from the memorial .
scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .
us commentators , cinema industry leaders and part of the media have attacked the ban , insisting cruise 's beliefs should have no relevance to his role in director bryan singer 's movie " valkyrie . "
replicas being built outside berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's office at wolf 's lair after the assassination attempt stauffenberg put a bomb under a table in a building at wolfsschanze , or wolf 's lair , hitler 's secret base in the woods near what is ketrzyn in contemporary poland .
hitler , however , survived the blast and within days many of those involved in the attempts on his life were rounded up and executed .
the scene was being recreated in woods at gross köris , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south-east of berlin .
reporters were unable to see the set , with the site sealed off by private security teams , roadblocks and miles of red-and-white tape . " in consideration of our film 's historical background , germany was the only location where the filming of ' valkyrie ' could take place , " said paula wagner , ceo of united artists , one of the film 's co-producers .
filming , partly funded by a german government grant , is scheduled to begin july 19 , according to ulrich arnts , chief executive of the schenkenländchen district administration .
stauffenberg is revered in germany as a national hero for his july 20 , 1944 bid to kill hitler , but leading german journalist frank schirrmacher has pointed out that the count had anti-democratic beliefs .
film details kept under lock and key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany have said cruise 's belief in scientology should prohibit him from the role studio babelsberg , the german movie studio which is co-producing " valkyrie , " declined to give details of the script .
" cruise views stauffenberg as a hero and will play him that way , " said christoph fisser , the studio 's deputy chief executive , adding that the script that been carefully researched .
reporters said cruise has already been sighted in berlin .
city newspapers say a huge suite was created in a luxury downtown hotel especially for cruise and wife katie holmes . film publicists declined to confirm this .
in schenkenländchen , arnts said two other nearby locations were also being prepared for filming : a former east german air force reserve airfield and an area of recently burned-over forest .
at the airfield at löpten , warning signs said only that the airfield would be in use for takeoffs and landings and there was no word of filming .
the project , reportedly also to star kenneth branagh , carice van houten , thomas kretschmann , christian berkel and tom wilkinson , is reported to cost 80 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.07.2007 sarkozy rocks eu boat with controversial economic ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has riled up some in the eu with his cocky style french president nicolas sarkozy is stirring up the eu with controversial economic proposals and attacks on the european central bank 's monetary policies .
critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .
now the west is tasked to react to the new realities created by putin .
with us-russian relations at their lowest since the end of the cold war , a meeting between putin and us president george w bush at kennebunkport , maine in early july brought little progress in resolving the issue .
at the group of eight summit in germany in early june , putin surprised bush by making an offer of using a russian radar site in azerbaijan as a substitute for the polish and czech facilities .
the kremlin leader then expanded on that in maine by including another site in southern russia .
while not rejecting putin 's initiative outright , bush stressed the us was determined to forge ahead with its plans in eastern europe .
both leaders agreed on intensifying dialogue between russia and nato , but this has not been enough for russia , saturday 's decision clearly shows .
cfe controlled and monitored forces in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments in europe were controlled by the cfe the original cfe treaty between nato and the then-warsaw pact states places upper limits to the deployment of conventional armed forces in europe - attack helicopters , artillery combat vehicles and aircraft - by a system of mutual verification and inspections .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
those so-called " istanbul commitments , " for nato an integral part to the cfe treaty , are one of russia 's main grievances .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
displaying its foreign-policy muscle by withdrawing from the cfe also plays into russian objections to un plans for independence for the southern-serb province kosovo .
moscow argues such a step would set an important precedent for other regions aspiring to independence - including some in the russian federation .
russia free to expand forces on its borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the treaty , russia can expand its military range putin 's decision also removed limits the cfe sets on the number of troops russia can deploy at its southern and northern flanks , in the past a major cause for concern for its neighbors .
russia on the other hand said it felt constrained on its own territory .
the treaty forbids troop concentrations in one place which could lead to large regional power shifts .
russia was concerned that the nato accession of countries like romania would shift that power balance in nato 's favor .
apart from the immediate implications , russia 's withdrawal must also be interpreted as part of moscow 's drive to reassert its superpower status .
bolstered by a budget comfortably padded by incoming petrodollars , large existing weapons arsenals and not to forget its hand on europe 's oil tap , russia feels it deserves to be taken seriously again .
suspending the cfe treaty is only one step in that direction . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while russia 's move to withdraw from the unloved cfe treaty does not come as a complete surprise , the current timing may be seen as a strong signal towards the united states to reconsider its missile defense plans , which russia fears are directly aimed against it .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced concern at russia 's decision .
the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- , which limits the number of heavy weapons deployed between the atlantic ocean and the urals mountains , is a centrepiece of the international architecture of disarmament , he said .
steinmeier said he hoped the international community would maintain contact with russia in order to ensure that talks on the cfe treaty could be reactivated .
the german foreign minister was speaking in the lithuanian town of nida on the final day of a four-day visit to the baltic states .
us missile shield plans blamed washington 's plans to for the missile interceptors in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
several warning signs already gave an indication of moscow 's intentions .
in speech to parliament in april , putin said russia should " consider " a moratorium on the cfe .
at a mid-june meeting of the 30 cfe signatory states in vienna , russia made its disenchantment with the 16-year old treaty , which it regards outdated and strategically flawed , abundantly clear .
west must react to new realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin left the vienna conference unconvinced while the vienna conference closed without tangible results , diplomats on both sides had at least agreed to keep talking and review each other 's positions .
but saturday 's developments show russia believes the time for talking is over .

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .

police investigating the fire searched the facility friday . the admission by vattenfall europe came after police searched offices at the site of the reactor at krümmel , near geesthacht , 30 kilometres south-east of hamburg .
in a report on the incident to regulators that was available on the company website saturday , vattenfall said there was a breakdown in communications between the reactor operator and the shift manager .
the misunderstanding involved the operation of valves designed to slow a rise in pressure in the reactor 's casing , following the failure of a water pump , the company said .
the operator opened two valves for several minutes , instead of alternately opening and closing them as the manager wanted .
as a result , pressure dropped rapidly in a short period , vattenfall said .
the swedish company has been forced to defend itself over its public handling of the june 28 incident , which led to the reactor being shut down .
police searched offices at the nuclear plant friday as part of an inquiry into a possible offence during the fire at the site , state prosecutors said .
the legislature of schleswig-holstein state warned the swedish-owned company vattenfall europe that it might lose its license to operate krümmel power station east of hamburg .
it called on company officials to testify at a state parliamentary inquiry next week .
prosecutors in the city of lübeck said detectives were sent to the site to inquire into reports that a reactor operator had to wear a face-mask when smoke from burning oil entered the control room during last month 's fire .
it was possible the man had been harmed by toxic fumes and that the company might have caused bodily harm by negligence , spokesman klaus-dieter schultz said .
top priority representatives of the swedish company , however , told police officers that this was not the case .
" the safety of our staff is a top priority for us , " bruno thomauske , the chief of vattenfall europe nuclear energy , said in a statement .
vattenfall had declined to name the operator so that he could be interviewed .
the detectives sought the name in records in the control room and offices at krümmel .
the company denied obstructing the inquiry and said it had vainly tried to contact prosecutors on thursday .
" we are cooperating fully with the authorities and the state prosecution and are doing everything to clear up this matter , " thomauske claimed .
" we have explained that nobody was injured . " safety improvements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge fears were raised by the krümmel fire last month gitta trauernicht , the state 's minister responsible for reactor safety , said in the schleswig-holstein parliament on friday she would use all her powers to force improvements at krümmel , one of 17 nuclear power stations in germany .
" i 've used the full range of legal means and ensured that krümmel remains deactivated , " she said .
she said she would insist it be in perfect order before it resumes operations , and added that she would not be deterred by demands for compensation from the company .
she said the day of blunders at vattenfall had been " unique " in the history of the german nuclear industry .
double trouble two vattenfall nuclear stations in the state failed on june 28 , one because of a short-circuit and the one at krümmel when its transformer caught fire .
neither reactor was damaged .
the fire at krümmel broke out just hours after the nuclear reactor at nearby brunsbüttel had to be shut down temporarily because its capacity was overloaded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire allegedly reached the building house the reactor the company initially said the fire at the krümmel plant had been isolated from the atomic reactor but , according to the regional social affairs ministry , the flames had reached the building housing the reactor .
the ministry also contends that vattenfall waited five days to report technical problems that occurred when workers tried to restart the brunsbüttel plant .
vattenfall has since admitted further mechanical mishaps including the smoke entering the control room .
german anti-nuclear groups have demanded that the company 's nuclear license be revoked .
under current legislation , all germany 's nuclear power plants are to close by 2021 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu executive underlined that access to services at affordable prices for the less well-off was also improving .
" the eu 's policy of opening the telecoms , transport and other network industries to competition has been the right one , since this has made them more competitive by putting downward pressure on prices without compromising either the service or its quality , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
he urged more liberalization , however , saying further action was needed to open so-far state-protected industries to internal and foreign competition .
eu fighting to open up more competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air travel is booming the commission is fighting hard to open up the bloc 's network industries , with the focus on telecommunications , postal services , electricity , gas , air , road and rail transport , which together account for around 8 per cent of the bloc 's value added and employ more than 10 million people .
eu officials said regulatory changes in network industries had created the conditions for the emergence of more competitive markets , with new and better products on offer .
" people are flying as never before " as the number of direct flight routes connecting european cities doubled since 1992 , said eu spokeswoman amelia torres .
also prices in these sectors had fallen over the last decade , in particular in the telecommunications and air transport sectors , she said .
same bonuses to come in time in the energy sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a liberalized energy sector gets the thumbs up from barroso the commission admitted that benefits were less visible in the energy sector because the liberalization process was more recent and because of the steep increase in oil and gas prices worldwide since 2004 .
the eu executive also complained that some governments were not correctly implementing the regulatory framework legislation in the energy sector .
productivity in network industries has grown faster than in the rest of the economy , the commission said , adding that this was often accompanied by employment growth .
furthermore , in many countries the number of jobs created by new entrants in the telecommunications sector , for example , greatly outnumbered the job losses at the incumbent companies .
the commission report comes at a time when france in particular is voicing increased opposition to across-the-board economic liberalization , with french president nicolas sarkozy instead putting the emphasis on so-called " economic patriotism . "
sarkozy succeeded last month in persuading other eu leaders to remove a reference in the bloc 's planned " reform treaty " to the need for " free and fair competition " in eu industries , a move which many in the bloc fear will slash commission powers in the sector .
but eu officials including almunia and commission competition chief neelie kroes have said this will not curb their drive to liberalize europe 's economic sectors . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .
while europe is reliant on russian energy , moscow depends on energy sales in europe and needs european investments in its natural-gas sector .

critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .

now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .
that 's why sarkozy was trying to step up political pressure on the ecb and tie it closer to the budgetary policies of the euro zone states . " but he 's choosing the wrong way to go about it with his offensive .
his approach against the ecb is counterproductive , " uterwedde said . sarkozy man may get imf job sarkozy 's pushiness in financial circles is however paying off in some respects .
in the face of opposition from some of his colleagues , sarkozy backed former socialist finance minister , dominique strauss-kahn to head the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn still needs to win over british support it remains unclear whether strauss-kahn will get the broad backing he needs to get the post .
britain has said it wants the job to be thrown open to worldwide competition instead of remaining a european preserve . experts say that if the french candidate does land the job , sarkozy 's economic reform zeal will know no bounds . " he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- will probably not stop presenting new proposals for eu economic and fiscal policies , " said uterwedde . torsten schäfer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.07.2007 sarkozy rocks eu boat with controversial economic ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has riled up some in the eu with his cocky style french president nicolas sarkozy is stirring up the eu with controversial economic proposals and attacks on the european central bank 's monetary policies .
critics say they 're endangering the bloc 's financial fundaments . after german chancellor angela merkel managed to painstakingly steer the eu out of its constitutional crisis last month , it seemed the bloc 's worst headache was over and that brussels could look forward to a period of relative calm .
but newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy rocked the eu boat again this week with his controversial economic policies . ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels this week , the french leader made no secret of his intention to dilute the eu 's stability and growth pact and thus play for more time to honor his election promise of carrying out a series of tax cuts in france . sarkozy flexes muscles the 13 eu members of the euro zone agreed in april to balance their account books by 2010 .
though sarkozy voiced his commitment towards that goal in brussels , he also stressed it could only be achieved if france 's economic growth was higher than it has been so far . in other words , he gave himself the go-ahead to violate the eu 's budgetary rules that lay down that the budget deficits of member states should not exceed 3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is fizzing with energy and ambition in his new job " sarkozy 's behavior is part of the french strategy to flex its new muscle in the eu , " said henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
" ever since the failure of the french referendum on the eu constitution , paris was almost absent in europe . " violating the eu budgetary rules is nothing new for member states .
germany has done it repeatedly .
but that took place at a time when the general economy in europe had come to a near standstill .
now , with the european economic motor having revved up again , experts say there is a renewed readiness in the eu to stick to fiscal discipline . " that 's why the eu states have once again committed themselves to the stability and growth pact .
they want to prepare for lean times with new saving measures , " said michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research in mannheim . france goes down special path france however seems to be carving out its own path away from the general consolidation course that other eu members states are following , dealing a blow to the new found faith in the pact .
eu diplomats have warned of france " opening the flood gates " because eu budget offenders such as italy or the czech republic could then follow the french example . remi allement , economist at the center for strategic studies in paris said france had trouble following a steady budgetary policy .
" the old government wanted to lower the deficit fast .
sarkozy on the other hand would rather take a break . " brussels however is powerless in taking action against pact violators .
the stability and growth pact lays down that during periods of economic growth , eu member states should cut new debts by half a percent each year .
but brussels ca n't impose any sanctions on those who do n't .
when deficits of countries exceed the three-percent ceiling , the eu can initiate disciplinary proceedings . but france will probably escape that since its deficit is estimated to be around 2.4 percent in 2007 .
in january this year , the eu released france from a similar process . sarkozy takes aim at ecb it is n't just the eu 's stability and growth pact that sarkozy is taking aim at .
he 's also rallying against the high value of the euro because it 's damaging french exports .
experts point out it 's not the first time the french leader has attacked the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- . it 's well known , they point out , that sarkozy wants to weaken the ecb .
allement said sarkozy would much rather that a " european economic government " had more influence on the interest rate and would increase the eu 's clout on the international finance stage .
" but sarkozy is alone with his plans .
the eu member states want a strong ecb , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear french meddling may undermine the ecb finance ministers in brussels have stressed the importance of an autonomous currency bank .
jürgen stark , member of the ecb board has said those who question the existence of the ecb " endanger the business fundament and a smooth functioning of the euro zone . " uterwedde said france was more interested in an active financial policy with growth and jobs as goals .

javier solana , eu foreign and security policy chief , has also appealed for " calm " in eu-russia relations , arguing that given moscow 's global clout and vast energy resources , the two sides must forge a " deep and solid relationship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has spoken his mind loudly to the eu recently russia 's president vladimir putin has been angered by eu criticism of russia 's human rights record , hardline policies in chechnya and repression of dissidents and reporters .
in turn , europeans are unhappy with russia 's strident anti-western tirades , including harsh criticism of eu newcomers poland and the czech republic for their plans to host parts of a us missile shield and of estonia 's recent decision to remove a soviet-era memorial from central tallinn .
hardball against soft power officials in brussels are most worried , however , about the growing rift within their own ranks on how best to deal with the bloc 's most powerful - and most difficult - neighbor .
eu governments are split between those who want to play hardball with russia on issues like energy and human rights and others keen to woo the country by using europe 's traditional " soft power " tools of aid , trade and diplomacy .
to some extent , the eu divide is based on history and geography .
russia 's direct eu neighbors and former satellites - including the three baltic states and five eastern european countries which joined the bloc in 2004 - are lobbying hard for a tough stance against their former soviet patron , arguing that moscow 's renewed imperial ambitions threaten its neighbors .
they are convinced of russia 's determination to use its energy resources as a political weapon - a sentiment that has grown since the brief cut-off of russian gas supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
the eu currently depends on russian natural gas for 25 per cent of its requirements , and the ukrainian cut-off disrupted deliveries to several western european states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears russia is using its oil as a political weapon eu newcomers have adopted a tough stance .
poland , for instance , has refused to give the go-ahead to launch negotiations on a long-sought eu-russia cooperation pact .
president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia insisted recently that the " two european goals are incompatible : european integration and appeasement of a rogue-like and threatening russia . "
and a recent czech foreign ministry statement warned moscow that that it is up to each state to decide how to cope with the past : " pressure exerted by another state is , as a rule , counterproductive . "
some favor strategic partnership but others , including powerful players like germany , the united kingdom , italy and france , are pushing for a " strategic partnership " with russia , covering joint efforts to combat climate change , forge stronger energy links and cooperation with nearby countries , including ukraine , georgia , belarus and moldova .
those seeking engagement with russia advise patience , arguing that moscow 's readiness to confront the west stems from increased wealth and a desire to reassert its influence as a world power .
eu trade chief mandelson says europeans must be more understanding of russia 's vulnerabilities .
moscow feels " increasingly encircled by the west and wedged up against a rising china , " he argues .
solana has pointed out that the west needs russian help in solving an array of problems , including efforts to convince iran to suspend uranium enrichment and the search for a final settlement for the breakaway serb province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel favors the voice of reason with putin it 's not just a one-way street , say eu officials .

the film crew has been banned from the berlin building , now a memorial site , where the plotter , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , was executed by nazi firing squad .
officials have said allowing filming at the site would lower the dignity of the memorial , but german politicians had earlier assailed cruise , 45 , over his advocacy of scientology and demanded he be banned from the memorial .
scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .

officials have said allowing filming at the site would lower the dignity of the memorial , but german politicians had earlier assailed cruise , 45 , over his advocacy of scientology and demanded he be banned from the memorial .
scientology is suspected by many germans of being anti-democratic .
us commentators , cinema industry leaders and part of the media have attacked the ban , insisting cruise 's beliefs should have no relevance to his role in director bryan singer 's movie " valkyrie . "

hitler , however , survived the blast and within days many of those involved in the attempts on his life were rounded up and executed .
the scene was being recreated in woods at gross köris , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south-east of berlin .
reporters were unable to see the set , with the site sealed off by private security teams , roadblocks and miles of red-and-white tape . " in consideration of our film 's historical background , germany was the only location where the filming of ' valkyrie ' could take place , " said paula wagner , ceo of united artists , one of the film 's co-producers .
filming , partly funded by a german government grant , is scheduled to begin july 19 , according to ulrich arnts , chief executive of the schenkenländchen district administration .
stauffenberg is revered in germany as a national hero for his july 20 , 1944 bid to kill hitler , but leading german journalist frank schirrmacher has pointed out that the count had anti-democratic beliefs .

reporters said cruise has already been sighted in berlin .
city newspapers say a huge suite was created in a luxury downtown hotel especially for cruise and wife katie holmes . film publicists declined to confirm this .
in schenkenländchen , arnts said two other nearby locations were also being prepared for filming : a former east german air force reserve airfield and an area of recently burned-over forest .
at the airfield at löpten , warning signs said only that the airfield would be in use for takeoffs and landings and there was no word of filming .

the official opening of the games was heralded by the arrival of the pan american torch and a parade of the more than 5,000 athletes from across the americas .
however the tight security meant that many fans could not get to the stadium in time .
brazil has not hosted an event of this size since the 1950 world cup .

the proposals will see three high schools - llanedeyrn , llanrumney and rumney - close while two welsh and english-medium schools will be built .
but a plan to move whitchurch high to a single site must have further consultation , councillors decided .
proposals will now be recommended to the council executive in the autumn .
council leader rodney berman , who chairs the schools sub committee , said he was delighted cross-party consensus had been achieved .
big leap forward " in a number of cases we still have to do some further work to gain full consensus on a way forward but i 'm very pleased that there is a desire among all party groups on the council to work towards achieving that at the earliest opportunity , " said mr berman .
" what matters most is that we are providing the very best quality of education in the very best facilities .
" we have now taken a big leap forward towards achieving that aim for generations to come . "
the council is proposing a staged school reorganisation after closures mooted two years ago were dropped following fierce opposition .
there are currently 20 secondary schools in cardiff , but there are 4,500 surplus places .
this leisure centre will be revamped as part of new school plans the schools sub committee was told in a report by corporate director neelam bhardwaja that nine of the 20 schools could have " significant budget difficulties " by next year unless the issue was tackled .
she said that 58 school staff were being made redundant next month " as a direct result of schools not being able to balance a budget " .
on friday evening councillors voted to : back plans to consult on closing llanederyn high and move st teilo 's to the site and create a third welsh medium secondary school at st teilo 's former site .
approve plans to consult on closing llanrumney and rumney high and to create a new community school on the eastern leisure centre site .
put proposals to move whitchurch high out to further consultation with ward councillors and political groups in the autumn .
allow further discussion on the relocation of eglwys newydd and eglwys wen primary in to one building on the whitchurch upper school site .
the future of cantonian high in fairwater and radyr comprehensive will be considered in the autumn .
back plans to consult on the closure of st anne 's primary and cefn onn primary .
the future of the city 's primary schools , which face the same problem as families continue to have less children , will be examined further next year .
the council says it is taking action in response to demands from the welsh assembly government and the education inspection body estyn for progress in removing surplus places .
it says the assembly government has made clear that failure to do so may result in future provision of capital funding for school improvements being withheld .

in the week former downing street spin doctor alastair campbell published his diaries , sir emyr jones parry said he would not " betray " his colleagues .
" kiss and tell is not for me , " said welsh-born sir emyr , about to retire as uk ambassador to the united nations .
he was in cardiff for the unesco -lrb- un educational , scientific and cultural organisation -rrb- annual conference .
" i 've been very privileged by the jobs i 've had - the access i 've had to ministers , the work i 've done with colleagues and i find it offensive frankly to betray that trust .
" when i 've negotiated intensely and privately with colleagues in other countries , they did n't expect me to publicise that in the press or otherwise , " said sir emyr , adding that he had not read mr campbell 's book .

yet even before leaving his un office , he is collecting new jobs : companies are calling him , and earlier this month he was appointed president of university of wales , aberystwyth .
" it 's an opportunity for another career , " he said .
" i started life as a physicist - ended up as a diplomat , and so now retiring will be like turning a new page in a book - a blank page . "

mr straw worked closely with him on european union matters as well as the un and iraq .
sir emyr found himself at the un after july 2003 , as comparative peace in baghdad , basra and fallujah descended into vicious and bloody warfare .

salvage experts are attempting to break the grounded ship in two in branscombe bay , after which the bow section would be towed away and the stern sunk .
the maritime and coastguard agency said the oil was residual pollution left over from the tanks being pumped out .
the rspca said seven birds were saved and it was preparing to rescue more .
the national trust has told people to avoid the area .
the ship , carrying 2,300 containers , was originally grounded in january after being damaged in storms .
she was refloated this week but beached again on thursday when a diving survey revealed the vessel was more severely damaged than feared . "
it is very sad that this has happened again but our staff will do everything we can to give the birds the best possible chance of survival " tim thomas , rscpa salvage experts were removing ballast in an attempt to break up the vessel by causing the hull to sag .
the mca is hoping the bow section will stay afloat and be towed away and the stern will sink to the seabed and eventually be removed .
the operation could take up to a year .
tim thomas , a senior scientific officer in the rspca 's wildlife department , said the rescued birds , believed to be guillemots , were heavily oiled .
he said : " we only recently released nearly 500 guillemots back into the wild after they were covered in oil in january after the napoli was grounded .
" it is very sad that this has happened again but our staff will do everything we can to give the birds the best possible chance of survival . "
small amounts of light oil has been seen on branscombe beach and heavy crude oil in the sea .
" we have asked the contractors on site to urgently deal with any oil and we are placing signs alerting the public , " a national trust spokesperson said .
" the national trust will now want to be fully satisfied that the environment and local communities ' interests are properly protected in deciding on how the wreck of the napoli is to be disposed of . "
a spokesman for the mca said : " there will be small amounts of pollution , that is unfortunate , but all the resources are in place to try and prevent that pollution getting any worse . "
an east devon district council spokesperson said salvage teams were cleaning up patches on branscombe beach and may spray dispersants on the water .
the spokesperson added the council would continue to monitor the situation closely .

salvage experts are attempting to break the grounded ship in two in branscombe bay , after which the bow section would be towed away and the stern sunk .
the maritime and coastguard agency said the oil was residual pollution left over from the tanks being pumped out .
the rspca said seven birds were saved and it was preparing to rescue more .
the national trust has told people to avoid the area .
the ship , carrying 2,300 containers , was originally grounded in january after being damaged in storms .
she was refloated this week but beached again on thursday when a diving survey revealed the vessel was more severely damaged than feared .
it is very sad that this has happened again but our staff will do everything we can to give the birds the best possible chance of survival tim thomas , rscpa salvage experts were removing ballast in an attempt to break up the vessel by causing the hull to sag .
the mca is hoping the bow section will stay afloat and be towed away and the stern will sink to the seabed and eventually be removed .
the operation could take up to a year .
tim thomas , a senior scientific officer in the rspca 's wildlife department , said the rescued birds , believed to be guillemots , were heavily oiled .
he said : " we only recently released nearly 500 guillemots back into the wild after they were covered in oil in january after the napoli was grounded .
" it is very sad that this has happened again but our staff will do everything we can to give the birds the best possible chance of survival . "
small amounts of light oil has been seen on branscombe beach and heavy crude oil in the sea .
salvage teams are cleaning up oil patches on beaches " we have asked the contractors on site to urgently deal with any oil and we are placing signs alerting the public , " a national trust spokesperson said .
" the national trust will now want to be fully satisfied that the environment and local communities ' interests are properly protected in deciding on how the wreck of the napoli is to be disposed of . "
a spokesman for the mca said : " there will be small amounts of pollution , that is unfortunate , but all the resources are in place to try and prevent that pollution getting any worse . "
an east devon district council spokesperson said salvage teams were cleaning up patches on branscombe beach and may spray dispersants on the water .
the spokesperson added the council would continue to monitor the situation closely .
