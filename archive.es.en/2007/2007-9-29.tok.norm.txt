" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.09.2007 france 's strauss-kahn named new imf chief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn will have to rebuild the relevance and legitimacy of the troubled imf the international monetary fund has named frenchman dominique strauss-kahn as its managing director at a time when the 63-year-old institution faces a crisis of relevancy and legitimacy in a world flush with cash . strauss-kahn was handed the reins of the struggling multilateral imf with backing from the european union and the united states after a late effort from russia to install its own candidate , josef tosovsky , a former czech central bank chief who was briefly prime minister of the czech republic .
the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .
" this is welcome , but he 'll need to set the tone from day one in the position to make it happen , " she added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said . " so many jobs are dependent on solid economic ties and so much dialog and cooperation develops between people though the economy .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .
" this is welcome , but he 'll need to set the tone from day one in the position to make it happen , " she added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .
" this is welcome , but he 'll need to set the tone from day one in the position to make it happen , " she added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .

they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said .

before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.09.2007 france 's strauss-kahn named new imf chief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn will have to rebuild the relevance and legitimacy of the troubled imf the international monetary fund has named frenchman dominique strauss-kahn as its managing director at a time when the 63-year-old institution faces a crisis of relevancy and legitimacy in a world flush with cash . strauss-kahn was handed the reins of the struggling multilateral imf with backing from the european union and the united states after a late effort from russia to install its own candidate , josef tosovsky , a former czech central bank chief who was briefly prime minister of the czech republic .
the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .
" this is welcome , but he 'll need to set the tone from day one in the position to make it happen , " she added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said . " so many jobs are dependent on solid economic ties and so much dialog and cooperation develops between people though the economy .

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .

28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big .

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .
27 , is still a question mark in the bremen roster after two kidney transplant surgeries earlier this year , and werder have yet to settle the issue of who else gets to play up front .
wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .

perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .
27 , is still a question mark in the bremen roster after two kidney transplant surgeries earlier this year , and werder have yet to settle the issue of who else gets to play up front .
wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .
the diego dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has been bremen 's saving grace - but can they keep him ?
on the brighter side , bremen playmaker diego has continued to excel .
and in even better news , the one true star bremen has left on the pitch decided this week to extend his contract with the club to 2011 .
but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .
bremen would find an offer like that almost impossible to refuse .

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .

wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .

" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2007 conservative bavarian party picks new leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber is the new face of the csu in bavaria after 14 years of stoiber bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , chose economy minister erwin huber as its new leader , replacing longtime state premier edmund stoiber . huber , 61 , said he would strive to maintain continuity with stoiber , the party 's leader since 1999 , saying stability and reliability would help the party to succeed .
" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .
27 , is still a question mark in the bremen roster after two kidney transplant surgeries earlier this year , and werder have yet to settle the issue of who else gets to play up front .
wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .
the diego dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has been bremen 's saving grace - but can they keep him ?
on the brighter side , bremen playmaker diego has continued to excel .
and in even better news , the one true star bremen has left on the pitch decided this week to extend his contract with the club to 2011 .
but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .
bremen would find an offer like that almost impossible to refuse .
but selling off their one remaining superstar would likely doom the werder 's effort to get through their current rough patch and return to the style of play that has made them perennial fan favorites . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .
" this is welcome , but he 'll need to set the tone from day one in the position to make it happen , " she added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said . " so many jobs are dependent on solid economic ties and so much dialog and cooperation develops between people though the economy .

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .

perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .

on the brighter side , bremen playmaker diego has continued to excel .

but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .
27 , is still a question mark in the bremen roster after two kidney transplant surgeries earlier this year , and werder have yet to settle the issue of who else gets to play up front .
wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .

on the brighter side , bremen playmaker diego has continued to excel .
and in even better news , the one true star bremen has left on the pitch decided this week to extend his contract with the club to 2011 .
but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .
bremen would find an offer like that almost impossible to refuse .

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said . " so many jobs are dependent on solid economic ties and so much dialog and cooperation develops between people though the economy .

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .

he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.09.2007 france 's strauss-kahn named new imf chief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn will have to rebuild the relevance and legitimacy of the troubled imf the international monetary fund has named frenchman dominique strauss-kahn as its managing director at a time when the 63-year-old institution faces a crisis of relevancy and legitimacy in a world flush with cash . strauss-kahn was handed the reins of the struggling multilateral imf with backing from the european union and the united states after a late effort from russia to install its own candidate , josef tosovsky , a former czech central bank chief who was briefly prime minister of the czech republic .
the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .
" this is welcome , but he 'll need to set the tone from day one in the position to make it happen , " she added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said . " so many jobs are dependent on solid economic ties and so much dialog and cooperation develops between people though the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.09.2007 departures , injuries leave high-octane bremen sputtering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were thrashed by bayern earlier this season for most of this millennium , werder bremen have played the bundesliga 's most attractive soccer .
but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .
27 , is still a question mark in the bremen roster after two kidney transplant surgeries earlier this year , and werder have yet to settle the issue of who else gets to play up front .
wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .
the diego dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has been bremen 's saving grace - but can they keep him ?
on the brighter side , bremen playmaker diego has continued to excel .
and in even better news , the one true star bremen has left on the pitch decided this week to extend his contract with the club to 2011 .
but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .
bremen would find an offer like that almost impossible to refuse .
but selling off their one remaining superstar would likely doom the werder 's effort to get through their current rough patch and return to the style of play that has made them perennial fan favorites . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .
" economic ties are responsible for the livelihood of so many people , " she said . " so many jobs are dependent on solid economic ties and so much dialog and cooperation develops between people though the economy .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .

the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.09.2007 departures , injuries leave high-octane bremen sputtering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were thrashed by bayern earlier this season for most of this millennium , werder bremen have played the bundesliga 's most attractive soccer .
but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .
27 , is still a question mark in the bremen roster after two kidney transplant surgeries earlier this year , and werder have yet to settle the issue of who else gets to play up front .
wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .
the diego dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has been bremen 's saving grace - but can they keep him ?
on the brighter side , bremen playmaker diego has continued to excel .
and in even better news , the one true star bremen has left on the pitch decided this week to extend his contract with the club to 2011 .
but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .
bremen would find an offer like that almost impossible to refuse .
but selling off their one remaining superstar would likely doom the werder 's effort to get through their current rough patch and return to the style of play that has made them perennial fan favorites . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .

wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .

but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .

" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .

before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .

german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .

germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .

business helps keep alive dialogue , they say . the five permanent members of the un security council and germany agreed on friday , sept .
28 to delay a vote on tougher sanctions on iran until late november at the earliest . the result is a temporary setback for the us and france , which had sought to pile up economic and political pressure on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is aimed at developing nuclear weapons . but , the move is expected to be welcomed by germany , iran 's biggest european trading partner , which has long insisted that any further sanctions must within the un framework .
before the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was critical that the international community remain united in dealing with iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the international community needed to keep working together " i believe that what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six .
iran 's strategy is to split the six but it has n't succeeded so far , " steinmeier said .
he added , however , that sanctions could n't be ruled out .
" we ca n't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution .
it depends on iran itself , " he said . in her first speech in front of the un general assembly this week , german chancellor angela merkel called for the international community to take a hard line against iran over its nuclear program .
german business interests many german politicians , however , believe that imposing economic sanctions against tehran would be ineffective and hurt german companies ' extensive trade ties with iran .
instead of punishing companies that do business with iran , negotiations should focus take advantage of the standing economic ties , eu parliamentarian daniel caspary , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , told deutsche welle .
" i think we need to use our good economic relationships to stay in contact with the people , business people and politicians in iran and to talk about the situation , " he said .
" i am of the opinion that countries like the us or france are pushing germany to limit its economic ties .
we should not accept that . "
germany , in fact , does more business with iran than any other european country , with annual german-iranian trade volume estimated to be about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.1 billion -rrb- .
at least 1,700 german companies are active in iran , including household names like siemens and basf which have been in the country for decades .
some 75 percent of all small and mid-size companies in iran are outfitted with german technology .
growing political pressure but , as international pressure grows to isolate iran , germany has been forced in recent months to scale back its economic interests in iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure from the us , deutsche bank stopped doing business in iran germany 's three main commercial banks , which include the powerful commerzbank and deutsche bank , have recently closed their doors in iran .
their official reasons remained the costly bureaucracy of doing business there , but experts have said political pressure from the united states , which has pushed for strict sanctions to be enacted , was behind their decision .
germany 's economics ministry has also rolled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with iran from $ 3.3 billion in 2004 to $ 1.2 billion last year .
trade in the last seven months has dropped by more than 15 percent .
chancellor merkel has also spoken out against german firms bidding for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in iran .
business keeps dialog open but , mechtild rothe , vice president of the european parliament , said that relations with iran have not reached a point where economic interests should need to suffer .
" i think it is important that the european union keep up relations with majority of countries in the world , including iran , " she said .
" i think it would be much better to negotiate - to speak with each other . "
closing the doors of business would also close other paths of communication , said erika mann , a social democratic member of european parliament .

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the csu is an independent political force and we will keep it that way in our partnership with the cdu .
they must know they need a strong csu to rule , " huber , a stoiber loyalist told party members before the vote , adding that he saw no need for radical change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave a farewell speech in vintage style , stressing traditional christian values the bavaria-only predominantly roman catholic csu party plays an important role in national politics because merkel 's cdu depends on csu seats in the lower house for power . huber will enjoy considerable clout with merkel and there is speculation that may take up a cabinet job , leading to a shake-up in merkel 's cabinet . bavarian interior minister güntfer beckstein is designated to replace stoiber as state premier . economic powerhouse and scandals the csu has ruled bavaria , germany 's biggest and most prosperous state , by an absolute majority for more than 45 years . the state is an economic powerhouse , home to a slew of high-tech firms and national corporate giants siemens and bmw and jobless levels way beyond the national average .
the state 's economy is bigger than 21 of the eu 's 27 member nations . huber , known to be competent but uncharismatic , beat challenges from german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer , whose popularity was dented among conservative csu members after his mistress gave birth to his child earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant gabriele pauli has shaken up things in the csu party his other rival was gabriele pauli , a glamorous rebel seen to challenge the conservative , male-dominated old guard in the party .
pauli , who posed on her web site in leather motorbike gear and has attracted major media coverage , recently created another stir by proposing that marriages should last just seven years . she alleged earlier this year that stoiber 's office was snooping into her private life , costing the long time premier his job after 14 years at the top . mosques must not overshadow churches in his farewell speech on friday , sept .
28 , stoiber underscored his vision of a successful society built on christian values , defended a traditional approach to family and marriage and urged bavarians to be proud of their state . he reiterated his opposition to turkey joining the eu and lashed out at merkel 's family minister for opposing the csu 's plans to reward mothers who stay at home to raise their children . " how can you describe that as an education policy disaster ? " he demanded . he also won huge applause for saying mosques were getting too big . " when the mosques in our cities are bigger than cathedrals and churches , then we must tell our muslim fellow citizens : ' no , that is going too far , ' he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber does n't want mosques outstripping churches in germany " church towers , not minarets , should be what you see when you look out across the state , " the 66-year-old said .
germany has the second-largest muslim population in western europe . stoiber is expected to head to brussels next to take up a post with the european union to reduce bureaucracy in the bloc . political bumbling stoiber came close to becoming chancellor in 2002 after winning the conservatives ' nomination over merkel . but their christian union alliance narrowly lost the vote to gerhard schröder 's social democrats . during the 2005 elections , he pledged his support for merkel but took aim at her several times during the campaign and continued to be a thorn in her side after she moved into the chancellery . political commentators say stoiber triggered his own political demise by accepting the post of economics minister in merkel 's government in 2005 , only to pull out at the last minute and opt to remain in bavaria . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former french socialist finance minister takes over at the helm of the imf from rodrigo de rato , who is stepping down next month .
his nomination puts a frenchman back at the helm at the imf , alongside pascal lamy at the geneva-based world trade organisation , jean-claude trichet at the european central bank in frankfurt and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development in london .
" france is no passionaria of globalisation , " french daily le monde said in an article ahead of strauss-kahn 's nominaton . " but it is over-represented in this world of international economic and financial institutions .
is there something in the french dna for this kind of job ? "
strauss-kahn 's candidacy was first proposed by the president of france , nicolas sarkozy in july and the campaign soon gained momentum with the support of the eu , which collectively holds 32.09 percent of imf voting rights , and the us , the single largest contributor with 16.83 percent .
with the campaign nearing its potentially successful conclusion , russia , which holds 2.70 percent , put forward tosovsky , who currently heads the financial stability institute of the bank for international settlements in basel , switzerland , claiming that he had wide support in the developing world .
however , the lending of additional support by brazil , argentina , india and a certain number of other large , emerging countries gave the strauss-kahn campaign its winning momentum in the days leading up to friday 's vote .
new imf chief 's fight for organization 's legitimacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf along with the wto is routinely targeted by anti-globlization activists strauss-kahn will have his work cut at the imf .
the institution faces a financial crisis , as emerging economic powerhouses like china and russia are flush with cash reserves and the need for imf loans and their stringent conditions has declined sharply .
interest paid on loans helps finance the institution 's operations .
" it will be a hard task for all of us to rebuild both the relevance and the legitimacy of this organization .
but i am prepared to do that and i ask you to be prepared as well , " strauss-kahn told the imf executive board .
a broad reform program spearheaded two years ago by the current imf managing director rato , to adjust organization 's role to today 's globalizing world , has made only incremental progress in giving a greater role to the developing economies in key decisions .
developing world unhappy at financial duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rato 's resignation came after his reforms seemed to fail it is believed that rato 's abrupt announcement in late june that he was resigning nearly two years before his term ends for personal reasons was linked to the failure of the reform program and the developing world 's unhappiness with the traditional arrangement of power at the imf and the world bank .
under an unwritten agreement struck in the aftermath of world war ii , europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank .
after paul wolfowitz was brought down as head of the world bank in may after accusations of nepotism , the us fielded the only candidate for the vacant position robert zoellick , who was widely approved to lead the poverty-fighting lender .
this seemingly unchallenged appointment caused further discontent in the developing world , adding to the dissatisfaction surrounding the appointment procedure at the imf .
in a bid to restart discussions on the developing world 's involvement at the imf and to give the crippled reform process a lift , the europeans have promised that strauss-kahn would be the last of the automatically european managing directors .
strauss-kahn urged to re-engage poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guarding the imf headquarters in washington the man himself has pledged to implement reforms that will restore the legitimacy of the institution , continue those aimed at giving emerging economies a bigger stake in the fund 's voting power and to strengthen the imf 's monitoring of a changing global economy , where countries like china had a bigger role .
development agencies and funds have called on strauss-kahn to promote changes in the way the imf is managed so that all developing countries get a fair say in its decisions .
" recently , mr. strauss-kahn has emphasized the importance of such reform and the need for the imf to adapt to a rapidly changing world , " oxfam 's washington-based policy advisor elizabeth stuart told reuters .
" this is welcome , but he 'll need to set the tone from day one in the position to make it happen , " she added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.09.2007 departures , injuries leave high-octane bremen sputtering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were thrashed by bayern earlier this season for most of this millennium , werder bremen have played the bundesliga 's most attractive soccer .
but this year , as their stars have gone down hurt or simply gone elsewhere , they 're just looking ordinary . this summer german soccer fans once again voted bremen their favorite team - a reward for a team from a small city that makes the most of its resources and usually plays an attacking , exciting style of soccer .
since 2000 , the worst werder have finished is seventh , and they 've qualified for the champions league four times on the trot .
but while their position in the standings is n't bad , this could be the season that bremen comes up short .
and what 's perhaps more dismaying to werder 's legions of fans - the team has shown little of the flowing , effortless flair it 's displayed in years past .
bremen have still managed to get results , but most of those successes have not come easily . one-man attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder miss the services of klose bremen 's scoring is down this year by around a goal per game - not surprisingly since the team is noticeably weaker at the forward position than at any time in recent memory .
the transfer of miroslav klose to rivals bayern munich temporarily filled bremen 's coffers , but it 's left a big hole up front .
new signing boubacar sanogo has played decently , but there 's no way he 'll be able to pick right up where the league 's most consistent goal-getter left off .
and he 's not getting much help from any of his partners .
the great werder teams of the past always featured lethal duos - from ailton and claudio pizarro to klose and ivan klasnic .
but klasnic , who returned to training in a protective belt made of fiberglass belt on thursday , sept .
27 , is still a question mark in the bremen roster after two kidney transplant surgeries earlier this year , and werder have yet to settle the issue of who else gets to play up front .
wobbly knees and sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' injury was also a huge blow and klasnic is just one of many on bremen 's long list of walking wounded .
perhaps the most solely missed convalescent is torsten frings , who served as bremen 's enforcer , defensive midfielder and former initiator of werder 's deadly fast-break attacks .
frings tore knee ligaments in the preseason and has yet to play a match this season .
he hopes to come back in october , and werder 's fortunes could hinge of a speedy return to his old form .
also missing is german international midfielder tim borowski .
he , too , is currently trying to overcome a knee injury .
but the strangest case is brazilian midfielder carlos alberto .
the most expense transfer - 7.8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - in club history has come up a bust .
alberto has all but disappeared off bremen 's radar screen this season , not even taking part in most practices after developing what the team claims is a severe case of insomnia . uncharacteristically bremen , who have a history of getting great value for money , seemed to have wasted a huge pile of cash on a man who ca n't get a good night 's rest .
the diego dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has been bremen 's saving grace - but can they keep him ?
on the brighter side , bremen playmaker diego has continued to excel .
and in even better news , the one true star bremen has left on the pitch decided this week to extend his contract with the club to 2011 .
but the diminutive brazilian 's run of good form - including a fine performance in werder 's recent 2-1 champions league loss to real madrid - also brings risks .
rumors are swirling that real want diego and would be willing to cough up between 20 million and 25 million euro to bring him to bernabeu .
bremen would find an offer like that almost impossible to refuse .
but selling off their one remaining superstar would likely doom the werder 's effort to get through their current rough patch and return to the style of play that has made them perennial fan favorites . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tory proposals also include a national number for accessing non-emergency health services outside working hours .
conservative leader david cameron said the government 's decision to allow gps to opt out of out-of-hours care had reduced access for patients .
but doctors ' leaders said the move was not to blame for poor out-of-hours care and the tory plans were ill-informed .
the conservatives said they were not planning to force gps to work out-of-hours or to work extended hours . "
the new gp contract is improving health outcomes for patients and in the long term will save the nhs money as fewer people will need admission to hospital because of a long term condition " dr laurence buckman but , in launching its new health policy , the party said that gps should hold the budgets to commission out-of-hours services .
currently , the responsibility for out-of-hours care is held by primary care trusts but many have been unable to afford to commission access to gps at weekends and during evenings because they have struggled with their deficits , the party said .
gps should receive incentives in the contract for gps to do extended hours if their patients want the services , the proposals state .
patient-centred the nhs should also be more accountable to patients , the conservatives said at the launch of the new policy in advance of the party conference in blackpool .
patients should be allowed to choose a gp - whether close to home or work , they said .
and urgent care should be simplified with a 999 phone number for emergencies , or 116 116 for all other healthcare such as a & e , out-of-hours and walk-in centres .
patients should also have genuine choice in childbirth and smaller obstetric units should be safeguarded .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said gps themselves wanted a change in the contract .
" they 're unhappy because they do n't have control of the service that they provide to their patients , " he said .
" and that 's what we want to give them - we want to give them control of budgets which must include the out of hours budget . "
the british medical association reacted angrily to the proposals , saying politicians were trying to outdo each other on ill-informed policies .
' no credibility ' dr laurence buckman , chairman of the bma 's gps committee , added : " it is sad that the conservatives have failed to understand why we needed a new gp contract .
" all sides recognised that the uk had too few family doctors .
" recruitment was at an-all time low , and doctors were thinking of taking early retirement because of the unsustainable workload . "
" the new gp contract is improving health outcomes for patients and in the long term will save the nhs money as fewer people will need admission to hospital because of a long term condition . "
he said pcts needed to fund the existing providers properly instead of trying to cut budgets or find even cheaper private companies to run the service .
ben bradshaw , labour 's health minister , said : " the tories are desperately playing catch-up on this issue , and their plans can have no credibility when , at the same time , they are proposing £ 21 billion of unfunded tax cuts that would inevitably mean massive cuts to the nhs . "

tory proposals also include a national number for accessing non-emergency health services outside working hours .
conservative leader david cameron said the government 's decision to allow gps to opt out of out-of-hours care had reduced access for patients .
but doctors ' leaders said the move was not to blame for poor out-of-hours care and the tory plans were ill-informed .
the conservatives said they were not planning to force gps to work out-of-hours or to work extended hours .
the new gp contract is improving health outcomes for patients and in the long term will save the nhs money as fewer people will need admission to hospital because of a long term condition dr laurence buckman but , in launching its new health policy , the party said that gps should hold the budgets to commission out-of-hours services .
currently , the responsibility for out-of-hours care is held by primary care trusts but many have been unable to afford to commission access to gps at weekends and during evenings because they have struggled with their deficits , the party said .
gps should receive incentives in the contract for gps to do extended hours if their patients want the services , the proposals state .
patient-centred the nhs should also be more accountable to patients , the conservatives said at the launch of the new policy in advance of the party conference in blackpool .
patients should be allowed to choose a gp - whether close to home or work , they said .
and urgent care should be simplified with a 999 phone number for emergencies , or 116 116 for all other healthcare such as a & e , out-of-hours and walk-in centres .
patients should also have genuine choice in childbirth and smaller obstetric units should be safeguarded .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said gps themselves wanted a change in the contract .
" they 're unhappy because they do n't have control of the service that they provide to their patients , " he said .
" and that 's what we want to give them - we want to give them control of budgets which must include the out of hours budget . "
the british medical association reacted angrily to the proposals , saying politicians were trying to outdo each other on ill-informed policies .
' no credibility ' dr laurence buckman , chairman of the bma 's gps committee , added : " it is sad that the conservatives have failed to understand why we needed a new gp contract .
" all sides recognised that the uk had too few family doctors .
" recruitment was at an-all time low , and doctors were thinking of taking early retirement because of the unsustainable workload . "
" the new gp contract is improving health outcomes for patients and in the long term will save the nhs money as fewer people will need admission to hospital because of a long term condition . "
he said pcts needed to fund the existing providers properly instead of trying to cut budgets or find even cheaper private companies to run the service .

now former journalist nia wyn 's blue sky july has been chosen as both bbc radio 4 's book of the week and wh smith 's book of the month for october .
it is a lyrical account of her life with joe , nine , who has cerebral palsy .
ms wyn , who grew up in prestatyn and lives in cardiff , said : " tragedy often has a way of connecting you more deeply with the world " .
she said the account was her " therapy " as she and joe 's father alex battled to defy medical predictions that their son would have little quality of life .
she said " we were given no hope for his life .
we were told that he would never see , he would never know us and certainly he would n't walk and talk .
" it was just horrendous .
your whole life is just tipped upside down .
" the journey began when we decided to fight against that , for joe . "
she said they tried every kind of therapy and treatment available , as well as alternative healers , eventually building a light room in their home to provide joe with stimulation .
' incredible breakthroughs ' she added : " it 's quite a traumatic journey because you will do anything to heal your child , but there is no official route you can go down .
" little by little he made incredible breakthroughs , seeing , being able to speak .
his speech is still affected by his condition but we were thrilled about that .
" he went from being told he would n't even know us to attending mainstream school . "
throughout these years , often after joe woke at night and needed attention , ms wyn , 45 , who has worked as a journalist in wales and london , wrote down her thoughts .
the book explores the impact on her thoughts and feelings , and the effect on her home life , love life - the couple eventually parted but ms wyn said her ex-partner was still very involved in joe 's life - as well her friendships and connections .
she said : " it was only diary jottings .
it was only when i was about halfway through i realised it was a story and a story that may be should be told .
' a mother 's love ' " it was such a personal book i questioned whether it was the right thing to send it off , it was a bit like sending off a piece of your heart .
" now that the book is out and i 'm starting to get letters back , it 's really lovely .
i think it was the right thing to do .
" with children with a serious condition , you can have the same wonderful times with your children as other parents , it 's often how we look at these things . "
she has embarked on a creative writing course at cardiff university and plans to write another book after that .
among those to have praised it is britain 's most successful paralympian , cardiff-born dame tanni grey-thompson , who said : " my emotions were everywhere when i was reading it , i felt sad , even angry at times , but ultimately it is the wonderful story of a mother 's love for her son . "
author and broadcaster yvonne roberts called it " unputdownable and utterly compelling ... a quiet classic , " while dame vera lynn said it was a " book that is full of joy . "
blue sky july will be bbc radio 4 's book of the week from 15 -19 october .

' incredible breakthroughs ' she added : " it 's quite a traumatic journey because you will do anything to heal your child , but there is no official route you can go down .
" little by little he made incredible breakthroughs , seeing , being able to speak .
his speech is still affected by his condition but we were thrilled about that .
" he went from being told he would n't even know us to attending mainstream school . "
throughout these years , often after joe woke at night and needed attention , ms wyn , 45 , who has worked as a journalist in wales and london , wrote down her thoughts .
the book explores the impact on her thoughts and feelings , and the effect on her home life , love life - the couple eventually parted but ms wyn said her ex-partner was still very involved in joe 's life - as well her friendships and connections .
she said : " it was only diary jottings .
it was only when i was about halfway through i realised it was a story and a story that may be should be told .
' a mother 's love ' " it was such a personal book i questioned whether it was the right thing to send it off , it was a bit like sending off a piece of your heart .
" now that the book is out and i 'm starting to get letters back , it 's really lovely .
i think it was the right thing to do .
" with children with a serious condition , you can have the same wonderful times with your children as other parents , it 's often how we look at these things . "
she has embarked on a creative writing course at cardiff university and plans to write another book after that .
among those to have praised it is britain 's most successful paralympian , cardiff-born dame tanni grey-thompson , who said : " my emotions were everywhere when i was reading it , i felt sad , even angry at times , but ultimately it is the wonderful story of a mother 's love for her son . "
author and broadcaster yvonne roberts called it " unputdownable and utterly compelling ... a quiet classic , " while dame vera lynn said it was a " book that is full of joy . "
blue sky july will be bbc radio 4 's book of the week from 15 -19 october .

when the queen flicked the switch at calder hall on 17 october 1956 , it was hailed as an " epoch-making " event by then lord privy seal , richard butler .
the world 's first civilian nuclear power station , on cumbria 's west coast , was built using tools and skills developed for wwii tanks and planes .
praised as a marvel of british engineering , calder hall promised a limitless supply of cheap energy .
but 51 years on , changing attitudes and new technologies have taken their toll .
at 1216 gmt on that day in 1956 , her majesty pulled the lever which sent electricity from the power station into the national grid for the first time .
a large " clock " on the wall registered the first energy produced .
nearby workington was the first town in the world to receive light , heat and power from nuclear energy .
richard hardiman 's father was one of a group of specially-recruited engineers who worked on calder hall 's construction .
an atomic " clock " registered the first generated nuclear power he remembered the reactor pressure vessels being driven through egremont in cumbria on the back of pickford 's lorries .
he said recently : " the reactor vessels could not be any bigger .
" they were cast in a foundry in scotland to a size that could just squeeze through the streets of egremont with a couple of inches to spare . "
marjorie taylor remembers being allowed the day off school .
she was at calder hall with thousands of onlookers awaiting the queen 's arrival .
she still has the invitation .
interviewed in 2006 , she said : " we stood for hours .
one woman near us collapsed because she had been so excited to see the queen that she had left home very early without eating anything .
we found a camp chair and a sandwich for her . "
the queen gave her opening speech in the shadow of the plant , where explosives were made for britain 's first atomic bomb , and she gave a timely reminder of the more sinister origins of the technology .
she said : " this new power , which has proved itself to be such a terrifying weapon of destruction , is harnessed for the first time for the common good of our community . "
the queen opened calder hall in october 1956 at its peak , calder hall generated four times as much electricity as it did in 1956 , but was still considered small by modern standards .
much of britain 's weapons grade plutonium was also produced at calder hall , for britain 's newly-developed nuclear deterrent .
calder hall closed in 2003 , after surviving nuclear scares like three mile island and chernobyl .
the government 's energy white paper , also published in 2003 , described nuclear power as " economically unattractive " , and focussed on the potential for renewable energy .
calder hall has succumbed to a nationwide decommissioning programme , which will see many of britain 's oldest facilities , including sellafield itself , shut down by 2023 .
but cumbria 's long relationship with nuclear energy is unlikely to end here .
the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- is based in the county , and the expertise which saw the transition from calder hall to windscale to sellafield will probably be used in a new generation of facilities planned for the 21st century .

but 51 years on , changing attitudes and new technologies have taken their toll .
at 1216 gmt on that day in 1956 , her majesty pulled the lever which sent electricity from the power station into the national grid for the first time .
a large " clock " on the wall registered the first energy produced .
nearby workington was the first town in the world to receive light , heat and power from nuclear energy .
richard hardiman 's father was one of a group of specially-recruited engineers who worked on calder hall 's construction .
an atomic " clock " registered the first generated nuclear power he remembered the reactor pressure vessels being driven through egremont in cumbria on the back of pickford 's lorries .
he said recently : " the reactor vessels could not be any bigger .
" they were cast in a foundry in scotland to a size that could just squeeze through the streets of egremont with a couple of inches to spare . "
marjorie taylor remembers being allowed the day off school .
she was at calder hall with thousands of onlookers awaiting the queen 's arrival .
she still has the invitation .
interviewed in 2006 , she said : " we stood for hours .
one woman near us collapsed because she had been so excited to see the queen that she had left home very early without eating anything .
we found a camp chair and a sandwich for her . "
the queen gave her opening speech in the shadow of the plant , where explosives were made for britain 's first atomic bomb , and she gave a timely reminder of the more sinister origins of the technology .
she said : " this new power , which has proved itself to be such a terrifying weapon of destruction , is harnessed for the first time for the common good of our community . "
the queen opened calder hall in october 1956 at its peak , calder hall generated four times as much electricity as it did in 1956 , but was still considered small by modern standards .
much of britain 's weapons grade plutonium was also produced at calder hall , for britain 's newly-developed nuclear deterrent .
calder hall closed in 2003 , after surviving nuclear scares like three mile island and chernobyl .
the government 's energy white paper , also published in 2003 , described nuclear power as " economically unattractive " , and focussed on the potential for renewable energy .
calder hall has succumbed to a nationwide decommissioning programme , which will see many of britain 's oldest facilities , including sellafield itself , shut down by 2023 .
but cumbria 's long relationship with nuclear energy is unlikely to end here .
the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- is based in the county , and the expertise which saw the transition from calder hall to windscale to sellafield will probably be used in a new generation of facilities planned for the 21st century .

marjorie taylor remembers being allowed the day off school .
she was at calder hall with thousands of onlookers awaiting the queen 's arrival .
she still has the invitation .
interviewed in 2006 , she said : " we stood for hours .
one woman near us collapsed because she had been so excited to see the queen that she had left home very early without eating anything .
we found a camp chair and a sandwich for her . "
the queen gave her opening speech in the shadow of the plant , where explosives were made for britain 's first atomic bomb , and she gave a timely reminder of the more sinister origins of the technology .
she said : " this new power , which has proved itself to be such a terrifying weapon of destruction , is harnessed for the first time for the common good of our community . "
the queen opened calder hall in october 1956 at its peak , calder hall generated four times as much electricity as it did in 1956 , but was still considered small by modern standards .
much of britain 's weapons grade plutonium was also produced at calder hall , for britain 's newly-developed nuclear deterrent .
calder hall closed in 2003 , after surviving nuclear scares like three mile island and chernobyl .
the government 's energy white paper , also published in 2003 , described nuclear power as " economically unattractive " , and focussed on the potential for renewable energy .
calder hall has succumbed to a nationwide decommissioning programme , which will see many of britain 's oldest facilities , including sellafield itself , shut down by 2023 .
but cumbria 's long relationship with nuclear energy is unlikely to end here .
the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- is based in the county , and the expertise which saw the transition from calder hall to windscale to sellafield will probably be used in a new generation of facilities planned for the 21st century .
