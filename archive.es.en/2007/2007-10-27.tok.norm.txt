program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 27.10.2007 french skepticism of gmo crops signals policy shift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many skeptical european nations have red-flagged gmo crops france is the latest eu country reluctant to use genetically-modified crops with president sarkozy suspending their cultivation .
the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .
" so the precautionary shift now in sarkozy 's tone is a seismic one . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.10.2007 a prison hosts germany 's library of the year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library opens up a whole new world to prisoners it may sound odd , but it 's true : a small , closed-to-the-public library at a prison in münster , in west-central germany , has received the national library of the year award . it 's like a bookworm 's paradise in prison .
the large room is filled with bookcases which reach nearly to the ceiling ; the rest of the space is lined with mirrors .
the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .

a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.10.2007 a prison hosts germany 's library of the year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library opens up a whole new world to prisoners it may sound odd , but it 's true : a small , closed-to-the-public library at a prison in münster , in west-central germany , has received the national library of the year award . it 's like a bookworm 's paradise in prison .
the large room is filled with bookcases which reach nearly to the ceiling ; the rest of the space is lined with mirrors .
the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

the large room is filled with bookcases which reach nearly to the ceiling ; the rest of the space is lined with mirrors .
the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .

a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .

europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

" we must have an intellectual discussion with every boy and girl who comes to us … about what germany is , " zwanziger told the online version of die welt newspaper .
" those who play for germany must know their history .
we need to fill gaps in their knowledge , particularly for players with immigrant backgrounds , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger says players with immigrant backgrounds need to learn german history zwanziger added that dfb sports director matthias sammer and senior team manager oliver bierhoff were preparing an education program with emphasis on germany 's sensitive history .
withdrawal sparked criticism the comments come after iran-born dejagah 's withdrawal from a european championship qualifier against israel for " personal reasons " prompted calls from jewish groups and some politicians for the player to be excluded from the national soccer under-21 team .

the large room is filled with bookcases which reach nearly to the ceiling ; the rest of the space is lined with mirrors .
the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to some 2.2 million turks germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote this week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
the website also quoted the german green party 's cem öcalan , a member of the european parliament , as saying that " this terrorist organization makes the job of democratic kurds impossible . "
high-profile members of germany 's turkish community called in thursday 's edition of hürriyet on europe to change its " indifferent position and to condemn these attacks on turkey . "

" we must have an intellectual discussion with every boy and girl who comes to us … about what germany is , " zwanziger told the online version of die welt newspaper .
" those who play for germany must know their history .
we need to fill gaps in their knowledge , particularly for players with immigrant backgrounds , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger says players with immigrant backgrounds need to learn german history zwanziger added that dfb sports director matthias sammer and senior team manager oliver bierhoff were preparing an education program with emphasis on germany 's sensitive history .
withdrawal sparked criticism the comments come after iran-born dejagah 's withdrawal from a european championship qualifier against israel for " personal reasons " prompted calls from jewish groups and some politicians for the player to be excluded from the national soccer under-21 team .
good ties with israel are central to germany 's foreign policy given the country 's nazi past and the holocaust in which some six million jews were murdered .
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah 's decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel 's online portal .
" it would be scandalous if the dfb does not take action . "
dejagah to play against israel next year dejagah , who plays for bundesliga club vfl wolfsburg , was born in tehran but later moved to germany with his parents .
he holds both german and iranian passports .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah was quoted as saying at the time .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bayern munich iranian-born striker vahid hashemian was pulled from the squad in a game against israel , causing controversy dejagah later apologized for his comment and said he was misunderstood .
dejagah has said he would play against israel when the team visits in september of next year for the return leg in qualifying for the european championships .

pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .

europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .

" we must have an intellectual discussion with every boy and girl who comes to us … about what germany is , " zwanziger told the online version of die welt newspaper .
" those who play for germany must know their history .
we need to fill gaps in their knowledge , particularly for players with immigrant backgrounds , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger says players with immigrant backgrounds need to learn german history zwanziger added that dfb sports director matthias sammer and senior team manager oliver bierhoff were preparing an education program with emphasis on germany 's sensitive history .
withdrawal sparked criticism the comments come after iran-born dejagah 's withdrawal from a european championship qualifier against israel for " personal reasons " prompted calls from jewish groups and some politicians for the player to be excluded from the national soccer under-21 team .
good ties with israel are central to germany 's foreign policy given the country 's nazi past and the holocaust in which some six million jews were murdered .
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah 's decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel 's online portal .
" it would be scandalous if the dfb does not take action . "
dejagah to play against israel next year dejagah , who plays for bundesliga club vfl wolfsburg , was born in tehran but later moved to germany with his parents .
he holds both german and iranian passports .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah was quoted as saying at the time .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bayern munich iranian-born striker vahid hashemian was pulled from the squad in a game against israel , causing controversy dejagah later apologized for his comment and said he was misunderstood .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to some 2.2 million turks germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote this week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
the website also quoted the german green party 's cem öcalan , a member of the european parliament , as saying that " this terrorist organization makes the job of democratic kurds impossible . "
high-profile members of germany 's turkish community called in thursday 's edition of hürriyet on europe to change its " indifferent position and to condemn these attacks on turkey . "
this week , belgian police also arrested over 100 youths of turkish in brussels after clashing with police during a banned anti-kurdish demonstration . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .

europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to some 2.2 million turks germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote this week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
the website also quoted the german green party 's cem öcalan , a member of the european parliament , as saying that " this terrorist organization makes the job of democratic kurds impossible . "
high-profile members of germany 's turkish community called in thursday 's edition of hürriyet on europe to change its " indifferent position and to condemn these attacks on turkey . "
this week , belgian police also arrested over 100 youths of turkish in brussels after clashing with police during a banned anti-kurdish demonstration . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .

several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .

" we must have an intellectual discussion with every boy and girl who comes to us … about what germany is , " zwanziger told the online version of die welt newspaper .
" those who play for germany must know their history .
we need to fill gaps in their knowledge , particularly for players with immigrant backgrounds , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger says players with immigrant backgrounds need to learn german history zwanziger added that dfb sports director matthias sammer and senior team manager oliver bierhoff were preparing an education program with emphasis on germany 's sensitive history .
withdrawal sparked criticism the comments come after iran-born dejagah 's withdrawal from a european championship qualifier against israel for " personal reasons " prompted calls from jewish groups and some politicians for the player to be excluded from the national soccer under-21 team .
good ties with israel are central to germany 's foreign policy given the country 's nazi past and the holocaust in which some six million jews were murdered .
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah 's decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel 's online portal .
" it would be scandalous if the dfb does not take action . "
dejagah to play against israel next year dejagah , who plays for bundesliga club vfl wolfsburg , was born in tehran but later moved to germany with his parents .
he holds both german and iranian passports .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .

several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 27.10.2007 turkish leader criticizes europe over kurdish militants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish helicopter scours the iraqi border for kurdish rebel camps as turkey threatens military action against kurdish rebel bases in northern iraq , prime minister erdogan slammed eu countries for not doing enough to tackle militants of the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- . in a televised speech at a symposium in istanbul on saturday , oct 27 , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan criticized european countries for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .

pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .

europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .
" so the precautionary shift now in sarkozy 's tone is a seismic one . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .

several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu .

" we must have an intellectual discussion with every boy and girl who comes to us … about what germany is , " zwanziger told the online version of die welt newspaper .
" those who play for germany must know their history .
we need to fill gaps in their knowledge , particularly for players with immigrant backgrounds , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger says players with immigrant backgrounds need to learn german history zwanziger added that dfb sports director matthias sammer and senior team manager oliver bierhoff were preparing an education program with emphasis on germany 's sensitive history .
withdrawal sparked criticism the comments come after iran-born dejagah 's withdrawal from a european championship qualifier against israel for " personal reasons " prompted calls from jewish groups and some politicians for the player to be excluded from the national soccer under-21 team .
good ties with israel are central to germany 's foreign policy given the country 's nazi past and the holocaust in which some six million jews were murdered .
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah 's decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel 's online portal .
" it would be scandalous if the dfb does not take action . "
dejagah to play against israel next year dejagah , who plays for bundesliga club vfl wolfsburg , was born in tehran but later moved to germany with his parents .
he holds both german and iranian passports .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah was quoted as saying at the time .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bayern munich iranian-born striker vahid hashemian was pulled from the squad in a game against israel , causing controversy dejagah later apologized for his comment and said he was misunderstood .
dejagah has said he would play against israel when the team visits in september of next year for the return leg in qualifying for the european championships .
last week zwanziger said dejagah had requested not to play against israel out of concern for family members still in iran and that he would retain his place on the national team .

how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .

europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .

the large room is filled with bookcases which reach nearly to the ceiling ; the rest of the space is lined with mirrors .
the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the large room is filled with bookcases which reach nearly to the ceiling ; the rest of the space is lined with mirrors .
the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .

but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu . " earlier the government was under pressure from industry groups to be pro-gmo , " said bebb .
" so the precautionary shift now in sarkozy 's tone is a seismic one . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.10.2007 a prison hosts germany 's library of the year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library opens up a whole new world to prisoners it may sound odd , but it 's true : a small , closed-to-the-public library at a prison in münster , in west-central germany , has received the national library of the year award . it 's like a bookworm 's paradise in prison .
the large room is filled with bookcases which reach nearly to the ceiling ; the rest of the space is lined with mirrors .
the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to some 2.2 million turks germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote this week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
the website also quoted the german green party 's cem öcalan , a member of the european parliament , as saying that " this terrorist organization makes the job of democratic kurds impossible . "
high-profile members of germany 's turkish community called in thursday 's edition of hürriyet on europe to change its " indifferent position and to condemn these attacks on turkey . "
this week , belgian police also arrested over 100 youths of turkish in brussels after clashing with police during a banned anti-kurdish demonstration . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .
when one type of maize was fed to rats in a laboratory study at the university of caen , their immune system was weakened . agricultural lobby pooh-poohs claims still , gmo soya , corn and oil seeds have been widely planted by farmers all over the world in the last decade or so , with more than 90 percent of the global supply coming from the us , canada , brazil and argentina . multi-national companies that supply the seeds argue that health risks have not been scientifically proven and biotechnological processes are kinder to the environment since they reduce the need for fertilizer and chemical killers . pascal ferey , vice-president of snsea , a union which represents big industry agriculture interests in france said that environmental groups are using scare tactics by misrepresenting the hazards of gmo crops to the public , which are unfounded in his view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo advocates say europeans consume gmo traces in cheese without even knowing it “ we consume gmo traces everyday in our meat , cheese , mayonnaise and ketchup without even knowing about it .
how many shoppers truly read the labels down to the last detail when they buy groceries ? ” he asked . maiz europ , an association of french maize growers was also critical of how ecological groups have manipulated public opinion and health studies to support their views . “ do you think brussels would have authorized gmo seeds if they were so dangerous ? ” asked spokesman pascal hurbault , who pointed out that gene techniques have been the best defense against two particularly voracious rootworms that have ravaged maize crops in southwest france . european gmo skepticism in stark contrast to us france becomes the latest european country to voice doubts over the use of gmos .
several european union countries have dug in their heels on whether their farmers may grow mon 810 maize . hungary , one of the eu-27 's biggest grain producers , banned the planting of mon 810 seed in january 2005 .
germany earlier this year decided that maize produced from mon 810 seeds could only be sold if there was an accompanying monitoring plan to research its effects on the environment . austria too could face an attempt by european union regulators to force it to lift bans on two gmo maize types . this past wednesday , the european commission authorized three more corn varieties and a sugar beet to enter the market , but the gmo crop seeds will be imported , not grown in europe . the raging debate over the future of gmos in europe is in sharp contrast to the united states , where gmo technology is much more widely accepted . genetically modified ingredients have found their way onto supermarket shelves in the form of cooking oils and processed foods , said bebb of friend of the earth europe . “ since gmo labeling is not required in the us , consumers don ’ t know what is in their food , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers are much more aware about gm foods due to labeling campaigners agree that there is more awareness in european nations about the dangers of genetically-modified food partly due to the fact that food producers are required by the eu to label products containing gmo ingredients .
various opinion polls show that at least 80 percent of the french public are against gmo foods , which are viewed as unnatural and unhealthy . despite the strong passions evoked by gm crops among both advocates and critics , most have welcomed sarkozy 's push for a leadership role on environmental issues that has long been neglected by his predecessors at the elysée palace . some point out that france 's policy shift on gmos will also have implications for the rest of the eu .

the issue remains a subject of heated debate in the eu 's largest agricultural producer . france lags behind its european neighbours on environmental issues such as recycling and using renewable sources of energy .
but this week environmentalists were full of praise for french president nicolas sarkozy for saying no gmo crops would be planted in france until the government had received the results of an evaluation by a new authority on gmos set to be launched later this year . green campaigners have long warned of the dangers of gmo crops , saying they are potentially toxic since the seeds have been genetically modified to resist pests and weeds . “ instead of spraying pesticides and herbicides , the toxins are produced in all of the plant ’ s cells , ” said geert ritsema , a greenpeace international anti-gmo campaigner in amsterdam , who attended a high-profile environmental submit convened by sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is supported in his green campaign by al gore the conference , attended by former us vice president and nobel laureate al gore and head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , was in keeping with sarkozy 's election pledge to put green matters at the top of the french government ’ s agenda . sarkozy stopped short of an outright ban on all gmos , which would have contravened eu agricultural rules , and stressed that his move does not call for halting biotech research . critics say gmos unsafe and toxic the future of gmos has long been the subject of heated debate in france with powerful farming lobbies and environmentalists at loggerheads over the safety and viability of using gmo crops . in the eu , the mon810 corn variety , which is produced by us-based biotech firm monsanto , is the only gmo maize that has been approved for cultivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.5 percent of france 's cultivated maize land has been sown with gmo maize this year although the gmo share of total maize production in france , the eu 's largest agricultural producing country , is barely 1.5 percent this year , maize growing increased fivefold from only 0.3 percent in 2006 . some farmers have urged greater use of gmo crops to boost yields . green lobbyists say gmos contaminate conventional crops and create imbalances in the ecosystem where wildlife has to coexist with farming . “ you have a built-in insecticide that is part of the plant 's genetic make-up , which not only kills pests , ” said adrian bebb , a gm food expert at the munich-based friends of the earth europe . “ pollen from maize falls into streams and impacts on ecologically useful or harmless insects , such as butterflies , ” he explained . greenpeace says that even though gmo maize is primarily used as animal feed in europe , the toxicity of such crops could have unforeseen longer term health implications for humans .

" we must have an intellectual discussion with every boy and girl who comes to us … about what germany is , " zwanziger told the online version of die welt newspaper .
" those who play for germany must know their history .
we need to fill gaps in their knowledge , particularly for players with immigrant backgrounds , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger says players with immigrant backgrounds need to learn german history zwanziger added that dfb sports director matthias sammer and senior team manager oliver bierhoff were preparing an education program with emphasis on germany 's sensitive history .
withdrawal sparked criticism the comments come after iran-born dejagah 's withdrawal from a european championship qualifier against israel for " personal reasons " prompted calls from jewish groups and some politicians for the player to be excluded from the national soccer under-21 team .
good ties with israel are central to germany 's foreign policy given the country 's nazi past and the holocaust in which some six million jews were murdered .
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah 's decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel 's online portal .
" it would be scandalous if the dfb does not take action . "
dejagah to play against israel next year dejagah , who plays for bundesliga club vfl wolfsburg , was born in tehran but later moved to germany with his parents .
he holds both german and iranian passports .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah was quoted as saying at the time .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bayern munich iranian-born striker vahid hashemian was pulled from the squad in a game against israel , causing controversy dejagah later apologized for his comment and said he was misunderstood .
dejagah has said he would play against israel when the team visits in september of next year for the return leg in qualifying for the european championships .
last week zwanziger said dejagah had requested not to play against israel out of concern for family members still in iran and that he would retain his place on the national team .
iran has refused to recognize israel 's right to exist since the 1979 islamic revolution and iranian citizens are forbidden to travel to israel .

dw-world.de german soccer player to remain on team after israel boycott a german soccer player born in iran and raised in berlin will stay on the under-21 team after refusing to play in a game in israel .

" we must have an intellectual discussion with every boy and girl who comes to us … about what germany is , " zwanziger told the online version of die welt newspaper .

withdrawal sparked criticism the comments come after iran-born dejagah 's withdrawal from a european championship qualifier against israel for " personal reasons " prompted calls from jewish groups and some politicians for the player to be excluded from the national soccer under-21 team .
good ties with israel are central to germany 's foreign policy given the country 's nazi past and the holocaust in which some six million jews were murdered .
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah 's decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel 's online portal .
" it would be scandalous if the dfb does not take action . "

he holds both german and iranian passports .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah was quoted as saying at the time .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "

istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan has slammed what he sees as the hypocrisy of european nations " the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad . "
" we want to see our western friends by our side in our fight against terror , " he told the conference .
" those who overlook terrorism are in cooperation with terrorism . "
a spat with austria over pkk erdogan did not mention any european nation by name .
but he did refer to a recent row with austria over its refusal to arrest a senior pkk member who then boarded a plane to northern iraq , news agency afp reported .
pkk treasurer riza altun emerged in austria in july after fleeing france , where he was indicted in february for terrorist activities and barred from leaving the paris region , the agency said .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover , germany in 2004 the pkk accuse turkey of oppressing kurdish culture and suppressing kurdish nationhood .
for its part , turkey says the pkk has been launching attacks on turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq .
europe not doing enough to rein in pkk ?
erdogan 's comments came after turkish-iraqi talks collapsed in ankara late friday to avert a major cross-border operation into northern iraq .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
the move has fueled us fears it could destabilize the relatively peaceful north of iraq and the wider region .
erdogan , under growing public pressure , has repeatedly said turkey will not tolerate any more attacks by the pkk , which has killed about 40 people in the last month .
turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops , backed by fighter jets , helicopter gunships , tanks , and mortars , on the iraqi border and the military has recently carried out limited operations into northern iraq against the pkk but no major land incursion .
turkey has long accused eu countries of tolerating pkk activities and failing to close organizations associated to the outfit .
istanbul says the pkk obtains much of its money through drug trafficking , people smuggling , extortion and money laundering in europe where it has an extensive network of activists .
in the 1990s , many kurds were granted political asylum in europe .
germany 's turks slam media portrayal of pkk the renewed spotlight on the turkish-kurdish conflict has also stirred passions among germany 's 2.2 million-strong turkish community , the largest outside turkey .
a meeting of 16 turkish groups in germany this week came to the conclusion that the pkk is played down in the german media .
" the press would be well-advised to be more precise in its formulations , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , said in an interview with spiegel online .
" if the pkk is played down , the people think that the german public support them , " kolat said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to some 2.2 million turks germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote this week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
the website also quoted the german green party 's cem öcalan , a member of the european parliament , as saying that " this terrorist organization makes the job of democratic kurds impossible . "
high-profile members of germany 's turkish community called in thursday 's edition of hürriyet on europe to change its " indifferent position and to condemn these attacks on turkey . "
this week , belgian police also arrested over 100 youths of turkish in brussels after clashing with police during a banned anti-kurdish demonstration . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ceiling itself is painted with green leaves , to allude to the vines of ivy that rope themselves along the prison walls outside . one could almost forget that one is in a prison if it were n't for the bars on the windows and the grates over the lights . three men - a librarian and two prisoners in blue uniforms - sit at the desk where readers can borrow books .
the prisoners help the librarian with checking out , sorting and even repairing books . behind them is a shelf lined with literature on law . user-friendly library bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detective stories are very popular the library is divided into different sections .
in one of them , users can look at a catalog list and order books .
in another area , they can pull out actual books they want to borrow . that is what was so convincing to the jury , which decided on the national " library of the year " prize awarded by the german library association and the zeit-foundation ebelin and gerd bucerius . " the jury was interested in the service offered to users and what is made possible in a detention facility , " said barbara schleihagen , managing director of the german library association . the jva-münster prison library even beat out heavyweights , munich municipal library and the university library in karlsruhe , in the competition for the 30,000-euro -lrb- $ 43,000 -rrb- " library of the year " prize . " also important were the comprehensive presentation of the collection and the attempt to provide literature for the prisoners from 50 different countries , " schleihagen said . " a collection of works in 30 languages is unusual . " limited selection in other prisons a prisoner named oliver o. cherishes the library .
before he was moved to the drug treatment center at the jva-münster prison , oliver spent time in jail in bochum . " it was n't like this there .
there , you would get a catalog delivered to your cell , from which you could choose to order from 30 different books , " oliver said . whatever books were available were delivered . " you did n't go to the books , they came to you in your cell , " he said . bildunterschrift : the prison library was praised for its comprehensive collection librarian gerhard peschers and the director of the jva-münster prison , maria look , did not like the system . " i think it 's important that the prisoners can leave their cells , which are quite small since jva-münster is one of the oldest prisons in the country , " said look . cells at jva-münster were built at about eight square meters -lrb- 86 sq. feet -rrb- in size in 1849 and remain that way even today . " so when prisoners can walk through the hallways and then enter the friendly atmosphere of the library , it has a positive effect on them , " said look . non-readers become literature enthusiasts the popularity of the library is reflected in the numbers who visit it .
of around 530 prisoners , about 80 percent use the library .
but no one can say what kind of prisoner becomes a library user , said librarian gerhard peschers . " i 've found that some prisoners have very little experience in reading , but when they are in detention , become great readers , " he said . " the others - intellectuals - use the library to expand their knowledge , " said peschers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : books in the library are available in 30 languages one of the inmates , paul p. never used to be a reader . " it 's a new world for me , " he said .
" i 've been here for a year and half and i was formerly a carpenter and builder .
i like being able to use the computer here .
i do n't really read novels here , but i like browsing through the technical literature . " prison literature around the world the library at jva-münster is actually not so cutting-edge on an international scale .
the netherlands and scandinavian countries are the leaders when it comes to making literature available in detention facilities .
nonetheless , germany has made significant progress in the last few decades . when libraries were first set up in prisons in the 19th century , generally only texts for religious study were available .
literature was n't supposed to entertain , but instruct . well into the 20th century , people fought over whether erotic novels and detective stories should be allowed in prison libraries . nowadays , nearly everything to be had -lrb- or not -rrb- in libraries " outside " can be obtained " inside . " " we do not permit books on scientology , and of course we do not want any texts on weapons or other objects which could endanger security , " said peschers . pornography and neo-nazi texts are forbidden . " but the prisoners love the detective stories in our collection , " he said . francisca zecher -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the society is concerned cost-cutting could signal the end of the scheme under which anyone keeping captive-bred wild birds must have them registered .
scrapping the system would lead to a sharp rise in thefts of wild birds from nests , it warns .
ministers are expected to make a decision on the scheme soon .
' effective weapon ' currently , anyone keeping any of britain 's rarest birds , such as golden eagles or peregrine falcons , has to register the birds under the wildlife and countryside act .
the rspb says such registration has proved to be " one of the most effective weapons in fighting wildlife crime " .
the society says that once the authorities know where birds are , they are able to build up family histories of legally captive-bred birds .
then through dna , they can prove when suspect juvenile birds have been illegally taken from the wild and " laundered " into the lucrative market for captive-bred birds . "
we can only use dna testing if we know where the birds are and who the birds are all related to " duncan mcniven rspb rspb figures show that prosecutions involving two of the most valuable species , the peregrine falcon and the goshawk , have fallen dramatically since dna evidence was first used in criminal prosecutions in the mid-1990s .
duncan mcniven , from the rspb , told bbc five live that ministers should consider the issue of registration carefully .
" we can only use dna testing if we know where the birds are and who the birds are all related to .
" that 's the beauty of registration - it requires the keepers of the birds to tell the government where the birds are , what their identity is and who they 're related to so you get family trees built up .
" and it can be proved one way or the other whether they 're taken from the wild illegally , or whether they 're legally captive bred . "
' clear purpose ' the rspb 's call has been backed by the police .
richard brunstrom , chief constable for north wales and the lead officer on wildlife crime for the association of chief police officers , described the measures as " conservation legislation with a clear purpose " .
" it should not be weakened or dismissed in some dogmatic government anti-bureaucracy drive without real thought being given to the consequences , which could be catastrophic for species ' conservation . "
biodiversity minister joan ruddock is expected to make a decision on the future of the registration system shortly .

the rspb says such registration has proved to be " one of the most effective weapons in fighting wildlife crime " .
the society says that once the authorities know where birds are , they are able to build up family histories of legally captive-bred birds .

duncan mcniven , from the rspb , told bbc five live that ministers should consider the issue of registration carefully .
" we can only use dna testing if we know where the birds are and who the birds are all related to .
" that 's the beauty of registration - it requires the keepers of the birds to tell the government where the birds are , what their identity is and who they 're related to so you get family trees built up .

richard brunstrom , chief constable for north wales and the lead officer on wildlife crime for the association of chief police officers , described the measures as " conservation legislation with a clear purpose " .

an algae infestation earlier this year in lake tai , in jiangsu province , led to a public panic and the suspension of water supplies from the lake .
the province now plans to spend $ 14.5m -lrb- £ 7m -rrb- in a five-year plan to improve water quality and control polluters .
more than 70 % of china 's rivers and lakes are badly polluted , figures show .
jiangsu 's government announced the cleanup plan on its website .
the plan would control the plant build-up in lake tai " in five years and realise the clear improvement of water quality , " the government said in a statement .
" in another eight to 10 years , the problem of the lake tai water pollution will be basically resolved . "
the lake was previously a major tourist attraction , but steadily declined as the wuxi area developed into a centre for manufacturing and high technology .
local difficulties in june a bloom of blue-green algae on the lake forced officials to suspend water supplies from the lake the city of wuxi , home to several million people .
the algae covered about one-third of the lake .
although china accepts the severity of pollution across its waterways , there remains some local resistance to those who highlight the issue .
earlier this year wu lihong , a well-known environmental campaigner who had regularly collected samples from lake tai , was arrested and convicted of blackmailing factory owners .
his supporters say his real crime was blowing the whistle on local polluters .
senior officials in the chinese government regularly speak out about the dangers of pollution and the need to clean up dangerously polluted rivers and lakes .
but correspondents say local officials are more reluctant to take action against polluters and enforce regulations .

an algae infestation earlier this year in lake tai , in jiangsu province , led to a public panic and the suspension of water supplies from the lake .
the province now plans to spend $ 14.5m -lrb- £ 7m -rrb- in a five-year plan to improve water quality and control polluters .
more than 70 % of china 's rivers and lakes are badly polluted , figures show .
jiangsu 's government announced the cleanup plan on its website .
the plan would control the plant build-up in lake tai " in five years and realise the clear improvement of water quality , " the government said in a statement .
" in another eight to 10 years , the problem of the lake tai water pollution will be basically resolved . "
the lake was previously a major tourist attraction , but steadily declined as the wuxi area developed into a centre for manufacturing and high technology .
local difficulties in june a bloom of blue-green algae on the lake forced officials to suspend water supplies from the lake the city of wuxi , home to several million people .
the algae covered about one-third of the lake .
although china accepts the severity of pollution across its waterways , there remains some local resistance to those who highlight the issue .
earlier this year wu lihong , a well-known environmental campaigner who had regularly collected samples from lake tai , was arrested and convicted of blackmailing factory owners .
his supporters say his real crime was blowing the whistle on local polluters .
senior officials in the chinese government regularly speak out about the dangers of pollution and the need to clean up dangerously polluted rivers and lakes .
but correspondents say local officials are more reluctant to take action against polluters and enforce regulations .

the closures are part of attempts to stem the financial losses of post offices throughout the uk .
earlier this month one group in rippingale walked three miles to morton to emphasise the distance to the nearest alternative branch .
john thornes , spokesman for the langworth campaign , said closures could affect the heart of many towns and villages .
" the implications are for the community .
what our post office does and what other post offices do is provide a community feel and atmosphere and we are going to lose some of that community identity . "
