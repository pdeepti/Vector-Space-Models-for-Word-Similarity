to that end , germany should not participate in attempts to establish an international mechanism that would allow exceptions when " diplomatic assurances " are given that a suspect wo n't be tortured , the study said .
" often people are then tortured , despite the diplomatic assurances , " heinz said at a press conference in berlin .
the german institute for human rights also called for the member states of the council of europe , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , to better control the actions of foreign intelligence services on their territories .
more accountability the study recommended the german government and parliament establish an independent body to improve control of the country 's secret services as well as their cooperation with foreign services .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .
belgrade call on berlin for clarification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants to know if berlin feels the same way the serbian government said it expected " the german government to clarify whether ambassador zobel has expressed the official stance of his government . "
serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .
though legally a serbian province , kosovo has been run by a united nations mission since mid-1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended the serbian forces ' crackdown on the independence-seeking ethnic albanian population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu plans kosovo takeover despite deadlock over future status the european union is allegedly planning to replace the un administration in kosovo despite the on-going deadlock over the province 's political future , according to a leaked confidential report .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .
today , the organization has tens of thousands of members - but that hasn ’ t kept britain from maintaining nuclear weapons . “ we ’ re not frustrated , ” said cnd chairwoman kate hudson , despite a recent major setback . britain to extend nuclear capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has decided to maintain its nuclear capacity beyond 2023 in march , britain ’ s lower house of commons approved a plan to replace its four ballistic submarines , which are due to go out of service in 2023 .
these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .
the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .
“ it ’ s mostly about deterrence , ” said fedchenko . “ however , new dangers arise with the non-official nuclear powers , ” he added .
“ there the control mechanisms aren ’ t as pronounced as in the us or russia . ” suppression of anti-nuclear opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans in seoul denounce north korea 's nuclear program in these countries , anti-nuclear protestors hardly have a voice .
in pakistan and india , nuclear warheads are seen as a sign of political power and are an object of national pride .
in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .
“ we also have to convince other countries to do it too , ” she said .
“ but as long as we claim we need them for defense , we can ’ t take this right away from others either . ” aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

to that end , germany should not participate in attempts to establish an international mechanism that would allow exceptions when " diplomatic assurances " are given that a suspect wo n't be tortured , the study said .
" often people are then tortured , despite the diplomatic assurances , " heinz said at a press conference in berlin .
the german institute for human rights also called for the member states of the council of europe , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , to better control the actions of foreign intelligence services on their territories .
more accountability the study recommended the german government and parliament establish an independent body to improve control of the country 's secret services as well as their cooperation with foreign services .
it would be tasked both with investigating human rights abuses as well as preventing them in the future .

the german citizen was arrested during a visit to morocco in 2001 and taken to syria .
investigators from germany 's bka federal intelligence service interrogated him there .
the institute also called on germany to be stricter in adhering laws to control civil aviation to prevent the kidnapping of terror suspects such as in the case of the cia 's practice of extraordinary rendition .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .
belgrade call on berlin for clarification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants to know if berlin feels the same way the serbian government said it expected " the german government to clarify whether ambassador zobel has expressed the official stance of his government . "
serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .
hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- " we want to get china working with the eu on climate change " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders , spoke to dw-radio about her visit and the state of relations between the eu and china .
-lrb- 15.01.2007 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- german government says hostage video shocking and inhumane german government officials condemned a video in which two germans taken hostage in iraq plead for their lives .
terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- iraqi militants extend deadline on german hostages militants in iraq who siezed two germans have released a new video saying they are giving germany a new deadline to begin pulling troops out of afghanistan or the two would be killed .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .

" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .

bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .

drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .

" that framework is needed to give the citizen enough protection , since this decision will make it much easier to exchange dna and fingerprint data , " he said . under the scheme , a police cooperation deal so far signed by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands and spain , would be extended to all member states . mutual access to dna data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometrical detection devices help collect data entitled the treaty of prum , after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , the scheme allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information . the data protection watchdog wants the agreement to specify " the categories of persons that will be included in the dna databases " and to limit the period for retaining information . the watchdog also " regrets that it does not harmonise essential elements of the collection and exchange of data . " hustinx said that his office 's suggestions - given to eu governments in the form of a report - " mainly serve to improve the text without modifying the system of information exchange itself . " " no impact assessment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol aims to ease communication among eu member states ' police " clarifications will ensure a harmonized implementation into national law and guarantee citizens ' rights as much as possible , " he added . he also said that the initiative had been launched without any impact assessment . in 2005 the european commission put forward a similar eu policing recommendation but failed to gain agreement from all member states . germany , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it hopes to have an agreement by all 27 eu member states on the plan by the end of june . last week , during a meeting of interior and justice ministers of the european union and the united states in berlin to discuss countering terrorism , data protection and visa issues , german german justice minister brigitte zypries called for information to be shared and for cooperation in law enforcement , while civil liberties also should be protected . european commissioner for justice and security franco frattini took it one step further and said transatlantic security cooperation was strong in the areas of justice , freedom and security . " our common goals are clear : to protect our citizens ' security by making sure law enforcement authorities have the right information they need to do their work and at the same time protect our citizens ' fundamental rights , ' frattini said . with regard to sharing air passenger data with the united states , frattini said last week that the eu executive was seeking binding commitments by washington on how data was handled , and that an eu-u.s. agreement would also guarantee that rules were the same in all 27 eu states . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .
hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .

andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "

the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .

reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "

its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .

" timely precautions must be taken against the foreseeable increase of the range of offensive missiles of certain problem states , even if it concerns long-term developments , " jung told reuters .
though the minister avoided naming iran directly in the interview , it was clear that he had iran as well as north korea in mind .
when asked how close he thought iran was to constructing a nuclear weapon , the defense minister said , " according to expert assessments , iran is years away from that point . "
he added that it was still possible to stop iran from becoming a nuclear power through democracy .
hope for diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has drawn criticism from the west " we can do everything possible to prevent iran from successfully combining long-range missile and atomic weapons , " said jung .
" and i 'm hopeful that we - the united states , europe , russia and china - can achieve this diplomatically . "

only after the ukrainian constitutional court has ruled on the legality president yushchenko 's dissolution of a parliament order " can we see whether there is space for european involvement , " he added . " members of the court can not escape their responsibility , " siwiec said .
" i believe ukrainian democracy is able to solve the problem using a word which is not popular , but useful : compromise . " siwiec told a news conference in kiev that , unlike in 2004 when yushchenko won strong , unequivocal western support , this time neither side could expect special treatment .

meanwhile , five judges from the court , three of them yushchenko appointees , said they were being put under undue political pressure . the sevodnya daily said the constitutional court 's decision to delay examining the case played into the hands of yushchenko by " cutting off the retreat for the governing coalition .

" russia and poland have expressed their readiness to be international mediators , " olexander chaly , deputy head of the presidential administration , told reporters . yushchenko cancelled a scheduled trip to address the council of europe in strasbourg on the political crisis , instead sending his foreign minister , arseny yatsenyuk , officials said . a delegation of russian parliamentarians also met deputies from the yanukovych-led governing coalition and voiced their support for the ruling majority 's stand against the president . ukraine must break deadlock , says eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu on the sidelines : solana and co. are staying out meanwhile , the european parliament warned eu institutions not to get involved in ukraine 's political crisis until its own people have had a chance to tackle the issues themselves .

only after the ukrainian constitutional court has ruled on the legality president yushchenko 's dissolution of a parliament order " can we see whether there is space for european involvement , " he added . " members of the court can not escape their responsibility , " siwiec said .
" i believe ukrainian democracy is able to solve the problem using a word which is not popular , but useful : compromise . " siwiec told a news conference in kiev that , unlike in 2004 when yushchenko won strong , unequivocal western support , this time neither side could expect special treatment . " all parties have a legal and democratic mandate now , " he said .
" that 's a huge difference .

meanwhile , five judges from the court , three of them yushchenko appointees , said they were being put under undue political pressure . the sevodnya daily said the constitutional court 's decision to delay examining the case played into the hands of yushchenko by " cutting off the retreat for the governing coalition .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- " we want to get china working with the eu on climate change " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders , spoke to dw-radio about her visit and the state of relations between the eu and china .
-lrb- 15.01.2007 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .

serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .

the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .
today , the organization has tens of thousands of members - but that hasn ’ t kept britain from maintaining nuclear weapons . “ we ’ re not frustrated , ” said cnd chairwoman kate hudson , despite a recent major setback . britain to extend nuclear capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has decided to maintain its nuclear capacity beyond 2023 in march , britain ’ s lower house of commons approved a plan to replace its four ballistic submarines , which are due to go out of service in 2023 .
these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .
the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .
“ it ’ s mostly about deterrence , ” said fedchenko . “ however , new dangers arise with the non-official nuclear powers , ” he added .
“ there the control mechanisms aren ’ t as pronounced as in the us or russia . ” suppression of anti-nuclear opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans in seoul denounce north korea 's nuclear program in these countries , anti-nuclear protestors hardly have a voice .
in pakistan and india , nuclear warheads are seen as a sign of political power and are an object of national pride .
in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .
“ we also have to convince other countries to do it too , ” she said .
“ but as long as we claim we need them for defense , we can ’ t take this right away from others either . ” aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .
the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2007 nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living under a cloud : the threat remains 50 years after the declaration 's signature the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .
fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .
today , the organization has tens of thousands of members - but that hasn ’ t kept britain from maintaining nuclear weapons . “ we ’ re not frustrated , ” said cnd chairwoman kate hudson , despite a recent major setback . britain to extend nuclear capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has decided to maintain its nuclear capacity beyond 2023 in march , britain ’ s lower house of commons approved a plan to replace its four ballistic submarines , which are due to go out of service in 2023 .
these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .
the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .
“ it ’ s mostly about deterrence , ” said fedchenko . “ however , new dangers arise with the non-official nuclear powers , ” he added .
“ there the control mechanisms aren ’ t as pronounced as in the us or russia . ” suppression of anti-nuclear opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans in seoul denounce north korea 's nuclear program in these countries , anti-nuclear protestors hardly have a voice .
in pakistan and india , nuclear warheads are seen as a sign of political power and are an object of national pride .
in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .
“ we also have to convince other countries to do it too , ” she said .
“ but as long as we claim we need them for defense , we can ’ t take this right away from others either . ” aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .
the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .

these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .

“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .
belgrade call on berlin for clarification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants to know if berlin feels the same way the serbian government said it expected " the german government to clarify whether ambassador zobel has expressed the official stance of his government . "
serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .
though legally a serbian province , kosovo has been run by a united nations mission since mid-1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended the serbian forces ' crackdown on the independence-seeking ethnic albanian population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu plans kosovo takeover despite deadlock over future status the european union is allegedly planning to replace the un administration in kosovo despite the on-going deadlock over the province 's political future , according to a leaked confidential report .

bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .

but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .

but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .
hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .

we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?

they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .

" that framework is needed to give the citizen enough protection , since this decision will make it much easier to exchange dna and fingerprint data , " he said . under the scheme , a police cooperation deal so far signed by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands and spain , would be extended to all member states . mutual access to dna data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometrical detection devices help collect data entitled the treaty of prum , after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , the scheme allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information . the data protection watchdog wants the agreement to specify " the categories of persons that will be included in the dna databases " and to limit the period for retaining information . the watchdog also " regrets that it does not harmonise essential elements of the collection and exchange of data . " hustinx said that his office 's suggestions - given to eu governments in the form of a report - " mainly serve to improve the text without modifying the system of information exchange itself . " " no impact assessment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol aims to ease communication among eu member states ' police " clarifications will ensure a harmonized implementation into national law and guarantee citizens ' rights as much as possible , " he added . he also said that the initiative had been launched without any impact assessment . in 2005 the european commission put forward a similar eu policing recommendation but failed to gain agreement from all member states . germany , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it hopes to have an agreement by all 27 eu member states on the plan by the end of june . last week , during a meeting of interior and justice ministers of the european union and the united states in berlin to discuss countering terrorism , data protection and visa issues , german german justice minister brigitte zypries called for information to be shared and for cooperation in law enforcement , while civil liberties also should be protected . european commissioner for justice and security franco frattini took it one step further and said transatlantic security cooperation was strong in the areas of justice , freedom and security . " our common goals are clear : to protect our citizens ' security by making sure law enforcement authorities have the right information they need to do their work and at the same time protect our citizens ' fundamental rights , ' frattini said . with regard to sharing air passenger data with the united states , frattini said last week that the eu executive was seeking binding commitments by washington on how data was handled , and that an eu-u.s. agreement would also guarantee that rules were the same in all 27 eu states . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .

" that framework is needed to give the citizen enough protection , since this decision will make it much easier to exchange dna and fingerprint data , " he said . under the scheme , a police cooperation deal so far signed by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands and spain , would be extended to all member states . mutual access to dna data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometrical detection devices help collect data entitled the treaty of prum , after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , the scheme allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information . the data protection watchdog wants the agreement to specify " the categories of persons that will be included in the dna databases " and to limit the period for retaining information . the watchdog also " regrets that it does not harmonise essential elements of the collection and exchange of data . " hustinx said that his office 's suggestions - given to eu governments in the form of a report - " mainly serve to improve the text without modifying the system of information exchange itself . " " no impact assessment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol aims to ease communication among eu member states ' police " clarifications will ensure a harmonized implementation into national law and guarantee citizens ' rights as much as possible , " he added . he also said that the initiative had been launched without any impact assessment . in 2005 the european commission put forward a similar eu policing recommendation but failed to gain agreement from all member states . germany , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it hopes to have an agreement by all 27 eu member states on the plan by the end of june . last week , during a meeting of interior and justice ministers of the european union and the united states in berlin to discuss countering terrorism , data protection and visa issues , german german justice minister brigitte zypries called for information to be shared and for cooperation in law enforcement , while civil liberties also should be protected . european commissioner for justice and security franco frattini took it one step further and said transatlantic security cooperation was strong in the areas of justice , freedom and security . " our common goals are clear : to protect our citizens ' security by making sure law enforcement authorities have the right information they need to do their work and at the same time protect our citizens ' fundamental rights , ' frattini said . with regard to sharing air passenger data with the united states , frattini said last week that the eu executive was seeking binding commitments by washington on how data was handled , and that an eu-u.s. agreement would also guarantee that rules were the same in all 27 eu states . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .

" hans filbinger was not a national socialist , " said günther oettinger , the christian democratic premier of the state of baden-württemberg , at the service on wednesday in freiburg .
filbinger , baden-württemberg 's premier from 1966-1978 , died on april 1 at the age of 93 .
he had been a military judge under the nazis and was allegedly responsible for proclaiming death sentences even after germany 's world war ii capitulation .

" he did n't have the power to make decisions nor the freedom to make decisions that his critics allege . "
oettinger said filbinger was an opponent of the nazis but was forced to bow to the pressures of the times .
" sadistic nazi " " i find the comment atrocious and it also conveys the wrong message , " responded dieter graumann , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" it glosses over the actual guilt of a man like hans filbinger . "
graumann said it was a fact that filbinger had been involved in sentencing people to death and that he had indeed supported the nazi regime .
" up to the last moment , he did n't recognize that and apparently his successor does n't either , " graumann said .
playwright and author hochhuth deemed oettinger 's comments a " barefaced fabrication " and said it had been proven that filbinger personally killed a man in british captivity , because the judge was a " sadistic nazi .

these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

" hans filbinger was not a national socialist , " said günther oettinger , the christian democratic premier of the state of baden-württemberg , at the service on wednesday in freiburg .
filbinger , baden-württemberg 's premier from 1966-1978 , died on april 1 at the age of 93 .
he had been a military judge under the nazis and was allegedly responsible for proclaiming death sentences even after germany 's world war ii capitulation .
the christian democrat resigned from office after a 1978 play by rolf hochhuth revealed that he had been involved in sentencing german soldiers to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger -lrb- r . -rrb- and erwin teufel , both successors of filbinger as premier , attended the funeral " there is no sentence from hans filbinger due to which someone lost his life , " oettinger said .
" he did n't have the power to make decisions nor the freedom to make decisions that his critics allege . "
oettinger said filbinger was an opponent of the nazis but was forced to bow to the pressures of the times .
" sadistic nazi " " i find the comment atrocious and it also conveys the wrong message , " responded dieter graumann , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" it glosses over the actual guilt of a man like hans filbinger . "
graumann said it was a fact that filbinger had been involved in sentencing people to death and that he had indeed supported the nazi regime .
" up to the last moment , he did n't recognize that and apparently his successor does n't either , " graumann said .
playwright and author hochhuth deemed oettinger 's comments a " barefaced fabrication " and said it had been proven that filbinger personally killed a man in british captivity , because the judge was a " sadistic nazi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .
hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .

serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .
today , the organization has tens of thousands of members - but that hasn ’ t kept britain from maintaining nuclear weapons . “ we ’ re not frustrated , ” said cnd chairwoman kate hudson , despite a recent major setback . britain to extend nuclear capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has decided to maintain its nuclear capacity beyond 2023 in march , britain ’ s lower house of commons approved a plan to replace its four ballistic submarines , which are due to go out of service in 2023 .
these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .

these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .

“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2007 " never antagonize any of the hostage takers " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centurion instructors capture a " hostage " during a training exercise for journalists as a second deadline for two germans being held hostage in iraq is set to expire , a security consultant told dw-world.de about the factors that influence hostages ' state of mind during their captivity . paul rees is the director of centurion risk assessment services , a british company that provides training and information to journalists , aid agencies , ngos and human rights organizations traveling and working in hostile environments .
dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- german government says hostage video shocking and inhumane german government officials condemned a video in which two germans taken hostage in iraq plead for their lives .
terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money .

if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

" hans filbinger was not a national socialist , " said günther oettinger , the christian democratic premier of the state of baden-württemberg , at the service on wednesday in freiburg .
filbinger , baden-württemberg 's premier from 1966-1978 , died on april 1 at the age of 93 .
he had been a military judge under the nazis and was allegedly responsible for proclaiming death sentences even after germany 's world war ii capitulation .
the christian democrat resigned from office after a 1978 play by rolf hochhuth revealed that he had been involved in sentencing german soldiers to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger -lrb- r . -rrb- and erwin teufel , both successors of filbinger as premier , attended the funeral " there is no sentence from hans filbinger due to which someone lost his life , " oettinger said .
" he did n't have the power to make decisions nor the freedom to make decisions that his critics allege . "
oettinger said filbinger was an opponent of the nazis but was forced to bow to the pressures of the times .
" sadistic nazi " " i find the comment atrocious and it also conveys the wrong message , " responded dieter graumann , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" it glosses over the actual guilt of a man like hans filbinger . "
graumann said it was a fact that filbinger had been involved in sentencing people to death and that he had indeed supported the nazi regime .
" up to the last moment , he did n't recognize that and apparently his successor does n't either , " graumann said .
playwright and author hochhuth deemed oettinger 's comments a " barefaced fabrication " and said it had been proven that filbinger personally killed a man in british captivity , because the judge was a " sadistic nazi .

" hans filbinger was not a national socialist , " said günther oettinger , the christian democratic premier of the state of baden-württemberg , at the service on wednesday in freiburg .
filbinger , baden-württemberg 's premier from 1966-1978 , died on april 1 at the age of 93 .
he had been a military judge under the nazis and was allegedly responsible for proclaiming death sentences even after germany 's world war ii capitulation .
the christian democrat resigned from office after a 1978 play by rolf hochhuth revealed that he had been involved in sentencing german soldiers to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger -lrb- r . -rrb- and erwin teufel , both successors of filbinger as premier , attended the funeral " there is no sentence from hans filbinger due to which someone lost his life , " oettinger said .
" he did n't have the power to make decisions nor the freedom to make decisions that his critics allege . "
oettinger said filbinger was an opponent of the nazis but was forced to bow to the pressures of the times .
" sadistic nazi " " i find the comment atrocious and it also conveys the wrong message , " responded dieter graumann , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" it glosses over the actual guilt of a man like hans filbinger . "
graumann said it was a fact that filbinger had been involved in sentencing people to death and that he had indeed supported the nazi regime .
" up to the last moment , he did n't recognize that and apparently his successor does n't either , " graumann said .
playwright and author hochhuth deemed oettinger 's comments a " barefaced fabrication " and said it had been proven that filbinger personally killed a man in british captivity , because the judge was a " sadistic nazi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "

its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .

reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 12.04.2007 opinion : money plus style equals success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fact that three of four champions league semifinalists are english clubs underscores the premier league 's rise to the top .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .

but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .
belgrade call on berlin for clarification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants to know if berlin feels the same way the serbian government said it expected " the german government to clarify whether ambassador zobel has expressed the official stance of his government . "
serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .
hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .

thousands of yushchenko supporters demonstrated on europe square nearby . " the presidential decree is unconstitutional .
that 's not my president and his party is against the people , " georgy yershov , a 70-year-old pensioner from dnipropetrovsk in eastern ukraine , said at the anti-yushchenko rally . at the pro-presidential rally , demonstrators held up placards reading : " honest court , honest elections , " " east and west together " and " no to the criminals in power ! " " we 're here to support the president and his decision ...
there is a lot of pressure against the judges .

" russia and poland have expressed their readiness to be international mediators , " olexander chaly , deputy head of the presidential administration , told reporters . yushchenko cancelled a scheduled trip to address the council of europe in strasbourg on the political crisis , instead sending his foreign minister , arseny yatsenyuk , officials said . a delegation of russian parliamentarians also met deputies from the yanukovych-led governing coalition and voiced their support for the ruling majority 's stand against the president . ukraine must break deadlock , says eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu on the sidelines : solana and co. are staying out meanwhile , the european parliament warned eu institutions not to get involved in ukraine 's political crisis until its own people have had a chance to tackle the issues themselves . " all resources in ukraine should be used to solve the problem , " marek siwiec , the deputy chairman of the european parliament , said .
only after the ukrainian constitutional court has ruled on the legality president yushchenko 's dissolution of a parliament order " can we see whether there is space for european involvement , " he added . " members of the court can not escape their responsibility , " siwiec said .
" i believe ukrainian democracy is able to solve the problem using a word which is not popular , but useful : compromise . " siwiec told a news conference in kiev that , unlike in 2004 when yushchenko won strong , unequivocal western support , this time neither side could expect special treatment . " all parties have a legal and democratic mandate now , " he said .
" that 's a huge difference . " court decision expected next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court will rule on the dissolution of parliament the constitutional court , which is made up of 18 judges , has been asked by yanukovych to rule on the legality of the presidential decree and a decision is expected within weeks , experts said . on tuesday , the court announced that it would not start examining the case until april 17 .
meanwhile , five judges from the court , three of them yushchenko appointees , said they were being put under undue political pressure . the sevodnya daily said the constitutional court 's decision to delay examining the case played into the hands of yushchenko by " cutting off the retreat for the governing coalition .

the united states wants to build a radar station in the czech republic and a missile battery in poland as a shield against possible nuclear attacks from what it calls " rogue states , " namely iran and north korea .
timely precautions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he still believes diplomacy can resolve the tension with iran the controversial plan has met with opposition among the ruling coalition in germany , as well as in russia and central europe .
jung , a christian democrat , is the first high-ranking german official to speak out strongly in favor of the missile shield plan .
" timely precautions must be taken against the foreseeable increase of the range of offensive missiles of certain problem states , even if it concerns long-term developments , " jung told reuters .
though the minister avoided naming iran directly in the interview , it was clear that he had iran as well as north korea in mind .
when asked how close he thought iran was to constructing a nuclear weapon , the defense minister said , " according to expert assessments , iran is years away from that point . "
he added that it was still possible to stop iran from becoming a nuclear power through democracy .
hope for diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has drawn criticism from the west " we can do everything possible to prevent iran from successfully combining long-range missile and atomic weapons , " said jung .
" and i 'm hopeful that we - the united states , europe , russia and china - can achieve this diplomatically . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that his country was now capable of enriching uranium on an " industrial scale . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.04.2007 " never antagonize any of the hostage takers " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centurion instructors capture a " hostage " during a training exercise for journalists as a second deadline for two germans being held hostage in iraq is set to expire , a security consultant told dw-world.de about the factors that influence hostages ' state of mind during their captivity . paul rees is the director of centurion risk assessment services , a british company that provides training and information to journalists , aid agencies , ngos and human rights organizations traveling and working in hostile environments .
dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- german government says hostage video shocking and inhumane german government officials condemned a video in which two germans taken hostage in iraq plead for their lives .
terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money .

these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .
the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .

in pakistan and india , nuclear warheads are seen as a sign of political power and are an object of national pride .
in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .

the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .
“ it ’ s mostly about deterrence , ” said fedchenko . “ however , new dangers arise with the non-official nuclear powers , ” he added .

in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .
“ we also have to convince other countries to do it too , ” she said .
“ but as long as we claim we need them for defense , we can ’ t take this right away from others either . ” aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .
the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .

the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

the united states wants to build a radar station in the czech republic and a missile battery in poland as a shield against possible nuclear attacks from what it calls " rogue states , " namely iran and north korea .
timely precautions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he still believes diplomacy can resolve the tension with iran the controversial plan has met with opposition among the ruling coalition in germany , as well as in russia and central europe .

" timely precautions must be taken against the foreseeable increase of the range of offensive missiles of certain problem states , even if it concerns long-term developments , " jung told reuters .
though the minister avoided naming iran directly in the interview , it was clear that he had iran as well as north korea in mind .
when asked how close he thought iran was to constructing a nuclear weapon , the defense minister said , " according to expert assessments , iran is years away from that point . "
he added that it was still possible to stop iran from becoming a nuclear power through democracy .
hope for diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has drawn criticism from the west " we can do everything possible to prevent iran from successfully combining long-range missile and atomic weapons , " said jung .
" and i 'm hopeful that we - the united states , europe , russia and china - can achieve this diplomatically . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that his country was now capable of enriching uranium on an " industrial scale . "

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 12.04.2007 opinion : money plus style equals success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fact that three of four champions league semifinalists are english clubs underscores the premier league 's rise to the top .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

the united states wants to build a radar station in the czech republic and a missile battery in poland as a shield against possible nuclear attacks from what it calls " rogue states , " namely iran and north korea .
timely precautions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he still believes diplomacy can resolve the tension with iran the controversial plan has met with opposition among the ruling coalition in germany , as well as in russia and central europe .
jung , a christian democrat , is the first high-ranking german official to speak out strongly in favor of the missile shield plan .
" timely precautions must be taken against the foreseeable increase of the range of offensive missiles of certain problem states , even if it concerns long-term developments , " jung told reuters .
though the minister avoided naming iran directly in the interview , it was clear that he had iran as well as north korea in mind .
when asked how close he thought iran was to constructing a nuclear weapon , the defense minister said , " according to expert assessments , iran is years away from that point . "
he added that it was still possible to stop iran from becoming a nuclear power through democracy .
hope for diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has drawn criticism from the west " we can do everything possible to prevent iran from successfully combining long-range missile and atomic weapons , " said jung .
" and i 'm hopeful that we - the united states , europe , russia and china - can achieve this diplomatically . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that his country was now capable of enriching uranium on an " industrial scale . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "

its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .

to that end , germany should not participate in attempts to establish an international mechanism that would allow exceptions when " diplomatic assurances " are given that a suspect wo n't be tortured , the study said .
" often people are then tortured , despite the diplomatic assurances , " heinz said at a press conference in berlin .
the german institute for human rights also called for the member states of the council of europe , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , to better control the actions of foreign intelligence services on their territories .
more accountability the study recommended the german government and parliament establish an independent body to improve control of the country 's secret services as well as their cooperation with foreign services .
it would be tasked both with investigating human rights abuses as well as preventing them in the future .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .
hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

that 's not my president and his party is against the people , " georgy yershov , a 70-year-old pensioner from dnipropetrovsk in eastern ukraine , said at the anti-yushchenko rally . at the pro-presidential rally , demonstrators held up placards reading : " honest court , honest elections , " " east and west together " and " no to the criminals in power ! " " we 're here to support the president and his decision ...
there is a lot of pressure against the judges .

" russia and poland have expressed their readiness to be international mediators , " olexander chaly , deputy head of the presidential administration , told reporters . yushchenko cancelled a scheduled trip to address the council of europe in strasbourg on the political crisis , instead sending his foreign minister , arseny yatsenyuk , officials said . a delegation of russian parliamentarians also met deputies from the yanukovych-led governing coalition and voiced their support for the ruling majority 's stand against the president . ukraine must break deadlock , says eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu on the sidelines : solana and co. are staying out meanwhile , the european parliament warned eu institutions not to get involved in ukraine 's political crisis until its own people have had a chance to tackle the issues themselves . " all resources in ukraine should be used to solve the problem , " marek siwiec , the deputy chairman of the european parliament , said .
only after the ukrainian constitutional court has ruled on the legality president yushchenko 's dissolution of a parliament order " can we see whether there is space for european involvement , " he added . " members of the court can not escape their responsibility , " siwiec said .
" i believe ukrainian democracy is able to solve the problem using a word which is not popular , but useful : compromise . " siwiec told a news conference in kiev that , unlike in 2004 when yushchenko won strong , unequivocal western support , this time neither side could expect special treatment . " all parties have a legal and democratic mandate now , " he said .
" that 's a huge difference .

meanwhile , five judges from the court , three of them yushchenko appointees , said they were being put under undue political pressure . the sevodnya daily said the constitutional court 's decision to delay examining the case played into the hands of yushchenko by " cutting off the retreat for the governing coalition .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .
today , the organization has tens of thousands of members - but that hasn ’ t kept britain from maintaining nuclear weapons . “ we ’ re not frustrated , ” said cnd chairwoman kate hudson , despite a recent major setback . britain to extend nuclear capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has decided to maintain its nuclear capacity beyond 2023 in march , britain ’ s lower house of commons approved a plan to replace its four ballistic submarines , which are due to go out of service in 2023 .
these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .
the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .
“ it ’ s mostly about deterrence , ” said fedchenko . “ however , new dangers arise with the non-official nuclear powers , ” he added .
“ there the control mechanisms aren ’ t as pronounced as in the us or russia . ” suppression of anti-nuclear opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans in seoul denounce north korea 's nuclear program in these countries , anti-nuclear protestors hardly have a voice .
in pakistan and india , nuclear warheads are seen as a sign of political power and are an object of national pride .
in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .
“ we also have to convince other countries to do it too , ” she said .
“ but as long as we claim we need them for defense , we can ’ t take this right away from others either . ” aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .
belgrade call on berlin for clarification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants to know if berlin feels the same way the serbian government said it expected " the german government to clarify whether ambassador zobel has expressed the official stance of his government . "
serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2007 nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living under a cloud : the threat remains 50 years after the declaration 's signature the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .
fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .
today , the organization has tens of thousands of members - but that hasn ’ t kept britain from maintaining nuclear weapons . “ we ’ re not frustrated , ” said cnd chairwoman kate hudson , despite a recent major setback . britain to extend nuclear capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has decided to maintain its nuclear capacity beyond 2023 in march , britain ’ s lower house of commons approved a plan to replace its four ballistic submarines , which are due to go out of service in 2023 .
these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .
the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .
“ it ’ s mostly about deterrence , ” said fedchenko . “ however , new dangers arise with the non-official nuclear powers , ” he added .
“ there the control mechanisms aren ’ t as pronounced as in the us or russia . ” suppression of anti-nuclear opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans in seoul denounce north korea 's nuclear program in these countries , anti-nuclear protestors hardly have a voice .
in pakistan and india , nuclear warheads are seen as a sign of political power and are an object of national pride .
in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .
“ we also have to convince other countries to do it too , ” she said .
“ but as long as we claim we need them for defense , we can ’ t take this right away from others either . ” aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .
the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .
-lrb- 10.04.2007 -rrb- us and north korea pursue nuclear talks in berlin the top us envoy to unprecedented six-way talks on north korea 's nuclear arms said in berlin he was having " useful discussions " with his pyongyang counterpart and hoped negotiations would resume this month .
-lrb- 17.01.2007 -rrb- merkel puts germany 's nuclear phase-out in question as senior belarusian officials arrived in moscow tuesday for crisis talks with russia regarding disrupted oil transit through belarus , german chancellor merkel stressed the need for diversifying energy resources .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- german government says hostage video shocking and inhumane german government officials condemned a video in which two germans taken hostage in iraq plead for their lives .
terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- iraqi militants extend deadline on german hostages militants in iraq who siezed two germans have released a new video saying they are giving germany a new deadline to begin pulling troops out of afghanistan or the two would be killed .

to that end , germany should not participate in attempts to establish an international mechanism that would allow exceptions when " diplomatic assurances " are given that a suspect wo n't be tortured , the study said .
" often people are then tortured , despite the diplomatic assurances , " heinz said at a press conference in berlin .
the german institute for human rights also called for the member states of the council of europe , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , to better control the actions of foreign intelligence services on their territories .
more accountability the study recommended the german government and parliament establish an independent body to improve control of the country 's secret services as well as their cooperation with foreign services .
it would be tasked both with investigating human rights abuses as well as preventing them in the future .
the institute also called on germany to stop sending its officials abroad to interrogate prisoners who were being held " in a torture context or in a situation without rights . "

12-year sentence zammar was sentenced in february to 12 years in jail in syria .
the german citizen was arrested during a visit to morocco in 2001 and taken to syria .
investigators from germany 's bka federal intelligence service interrogated him there .
the institute also called on germany to be stricter in adhering laws to control civil aviation to prevent the kidnapping of terror suspects such as in the case of the cia 's practice of extraordinary rendition .
the german institute for human rights was established in 2001 by germany 's parliament .
it is mainly funded by the german government .

" often people are then tortured , despite the diplomatic assurances , " heinz said at a press conference in berlin .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .

but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .
hanging onto hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all over for bayern munich for now milan midfielder gennaro gattuso said that they had never lost hope even after being held 2-2 at home .
" this is our fourth semi-final in five years .
if that is n't a great team then i do n't know what is , " gattuso said .
the germans had the advantage from the first-leg after belgian defender daniel van buyten 's equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time gave bayern a 2-2 draw at the san siro last week .
but they suffered a blow before kick-off when german international bastian schweinsteiger pulled out with a knee injury he suffered in last weekend 's 2-1 win over hanover after scoring the winning goal , and his influence was missed .
bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- " we want to get china working with the eu on climate change " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders , spoke to dw-radio about her visit and the state of relations between the eu and china .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- " we want to get china working with the eu on climate change " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders , spoke to dw-radio about her visit and the state of relations between the eu and china .
-lrb- 15.01.2007 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

oettinger said filbinger was an opponent of the nazis but was forced to bow to the pressures of the times .

graumann said it was a fact that filbinger had been involved in sentencing people to death and that he had indeed supported the nazi regime .
" up to the last moment , he did n't recognize that and apparently his successor does n't either , " graumann said .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

" hans filbinger was not a national socialist , " said günther oettinger , the christian democratic premier of the state of baden-württemberg , at the service on wednesday in freiburg .
filbinger , baden-württemberg 's premier from 1966-1978 , died on april 1 at the age of 93 .

" he did n't have the power to make decisions nor the freedom to make decisions that his critics allege . "
oettinger said filbinger was an opponent of the nazis but was forced to bow to the pressures of the times .
" sadistic nazi " " i find the comment atrocious and it also conveys the wrong message , " responded dieter graumann , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" it glosses over the actual guilt of a man like hans filbinger . "
graumann said it was a fact that filbinger had been involved in sentencing people to death and that he had indeed supported the nazi regime .
" up to the last moment , he did n't recognize that and apparently his successor does n't either , " graumann said .
playwright and author hochhuth deemed oettinger 's comments a " barefaced fabrication " and said it had been proven that filbinger personally killed a man in british captivity , because the judge was a " sadistic nazi .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .
belgrade call on berlin for clarification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants to know if berlin feels the same way the serbian government said it expected " the german government to clarify whether ambassador zobel has expressed the official stance of his government . "
serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .
though legally a serbian province , kosovo has been run by a united nations mission since mid-1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended the serbian forces ' crackdown on the independence-seeking ethnic albanian population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu plans kosovo takeover despite deadlock over future status the european union is allegedly planning to replace the un administration in kosovo despite the on-going deadlock over the province 's political future , according to a leaked confidential report .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .
if they have been sexually or verbally abused or beaten up , that would obviously play an important role when they come away from the hostage situation .
if they have been treated fairly nicely and medically looked after , it is likely to not have such a hard effect .
it depends on how the people are treated during the captivity . paul rees was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- " we want to get china working with the eu on climate change " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders , spoke to dw-radio about her visit and the state of relations between the eu and china .
-lrb- 15.01.2007 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .
ambassador 's remarks in line with un mediator 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari faces opposition to his plan from russia and serbia that is in line with recommendations made by united nations chief mediator martii ahtisaari for the future status of the albanian-majority province .
his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .
belgrade call on berlin for clarification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants to know if berlin feels the same way the serbian government said it expected " the german government to clarify whether ambassador zobel has expressed the official stance of his government . "
serbian president boris tadic also sent a protest note to the germany 's foreign ministry , and his office said german president horst kohler would receive a similar note .
the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .
though legally a serbian province , kosovo has been run by a united nations mission since mid-1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended the serbian forces ' crackdown on the independence-seeking ethnic albanian population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu plans kosovo takeover despite deadlock over future status the european union is allegedly planning to replace the un administration in kosovo despite the on-going deadlock over the province 's political future , according to a leaked confidential report .
-lrb- 12.03.2007 -rrb- serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament . “ differentiate between tactical and big atomic weapons , ” said konrad adenauer , germany ’ s first chancellor following world war two .
“ the tactical weapons are nothing more than the development of the artillery . ” the chancellor advocated arming the german military with nuclear warheads .
however , atomic physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker thought differently . in 1957 , weizsäcker penned a manifesto against the possession of nuclear weapons , which was signed by 17 prominent researchers , including four nobel prize winners . germany becomes a nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von weizsäcker 's -lrb- r -rrb- göttinger declaration was published on april 12 , 1957 when newspapers published the so-called göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 , it received resonance throughout the world : in germany , the “ fight against atomic death ” movement was founded . despite the appeals of anti-nuclear groups , the german parliament approved the nuclear armament of the bundeswehr as part of nato in 1958 . in the same year , the british campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- was founded .
today , the organization has tens of thousands of members - but that hasn ’ t kept britain from maintaining nuclear weapons . “ we ’ re not frustrated , ” said cnd chairwoman kate hudson , despite a recent major setback . britain to extend nuclear capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has decided to maintain its nuclear capacity beyond 2023 in march , britain ’ s lower house of commons approved a plan to replace its four ballistic submarines , which are due to go out of service in 2023 .
these vanguard-type submarines carry britain ’ s 16 nuclear missiles . opponents of the plan say it undermines hopes for international nuclear disarmament .
britain , the us , china , russia and france have all signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which calls for complete nuclear disarmament . however , the nearly 40-year-old document does not stipulate a timeframe for disarmament . “ the total number of missile heads is significantly declining , ” said nuclear weapons expert shannon kile from the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- .
“ but deterrence and clout should continue . ” “ it ’ s mostly about deterrence ” according to its emergency plan 8022 , the us sees the deployment of a nuclear missile as a last resort in the face of a direct threat .
the report names north korea , iran , syria and china as possible targets . “ china and russia also emphasize the smaller , more scurrilous nuclear powers , ” said vitaly fedchenko , an asia expert at sipri . although all official nuclear powers have reserved the right to strike first , the likelihood of this is slim .
“ it ’ s mostly about deterrence , ” said fedchenko . “ however , new dangers arise with the non-official nuclear powers , ” he added .
“ there the control mechanisms aren ’ t as pronounced as in the us or russia . ” suppression of anti-nuclear opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans in seoul denounce north korea 's nuclear program in these countries , anti-nuclear protestors hardly have a voice .
in pakistan and india , nuclear warheads are seen as a sign of political power and are an object of national pride .
in china and north korea , criticism against the government is often repressed . israel has never officially confirmed the possession of nuclear weapons - the nuclear scientist mordechai vanunu , who went public with his country ’ s nuclear program , was charged with treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . “ we have colleagues in these countries who are subjected to entirely different dangers than we are , ” said jens-peter steffen , consultant at the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- . “ what ’ s missing is widespread awareness among the population , ” said steffen .
“ the opposition only has very limited opportunity to express their opinion . ” kate hudson from cnd said it ’ s not enough to phase out nuclear weapons in our own countries .
“ we also have to convince other countries to do it too , ” she said .
“ but as long as we claim we need them for defense , we can ’ t take this right away from others either . ” aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

" that framework is needed to give the citizen enough protection , since this decision will make it much easier to exchange dna and fingerprint data , " he said . under the scheme , a police cooperation deal so far signed by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands and spain , would be extended to all member states . mutual access to dna data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometrical detection devices help collect data entitled the treaty of prum , after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , the scheme allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information . the data protection watchdog wants the agreement to specify " the categories of persons that will be included in the dna databases " and to limit the period for retaining information . the watchdog also " regrets that it does not harmonise essential elements of the collection and exchange of data . " hustinx said that his office 's suggestions - given to eu governments in the form of a report - " mainly serve to improve the text without modifying the system of information exchange itself . " " no impact assessment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol aims to ease communication among eu member states ' police " clarifications will ensure a harmonized implementation into national law and guarantee citizens ' rights as much as possible , " he added . he also said that the initiative had been launched without any impact assessment . in 2005 the european commission put forward a similar eu policing recommendation but failed to gain agreement from all member states . germany , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it hopes to have an agreement by all 27 eu member states on the plan by the end of june . last week , during a meeting of interior and justice ministers of the european union and the united states in berlin to discuss countering terrorism , data protection and visa issues , german german justice minister brigitte zypries called for information to be shared and for cooperation in law enforcement , while civil liberties also should be protected . european commissioner for justice and security franco frattini took it one step further and said transatlantic security cooperation was strong in the areas of justice , freedom and security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2007 " never antagonize any of the hostage takers " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centurion instructors capture a " hostage " during a training exercise for journalists as a second deadline for two germans being held hostage in iraq is set to expire , a security consultant told dw-world.de about the factors that influence hostages ' state of mind during their captivity . paul rees is the director of centurion risk assessment services , a british company that provides training and information to journalists , aid agencies , ngos and human rights organizations traveling and working in hostile environments .
dw-world.de : two germans , a 61-year-old woman who has lived in iraq for decades and her 20-year-old son who worked for the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped in iraq at the beginning of february .
how can a hostage 's mood change over such a per iod of time ?
paul rees : it depends on what the hostages are like .
if they are aggressive from day one to their release date , they wo n't get a lot of comfort from the hostage takers .
if , however , the hostage takers keep them alive , they will also look after their well being and their health .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rees said british soldiers held hostage by iran were right to be non-confrontational hostages should never antagonize any of the hostage takers and be polite and courteous at all times .
but you should retain your self-esteem and your self-confidence and always be positive about escape or someone coming in to release you .
we do n't know if the two are being held together or separately .
how is the situation different for hostages who are being held with someone else and those who are alone ?
if they are held together , the hostage takers have done it for a reason .
they would keep them together to keep the hostages from stressing out and to avoid any unwanted trouble from the individual .
they may also split the hostages up so they can not talk to each other , and so they can play one hostage against the other .
they can try and get information out of them by saying , " your mother already said x , y and z , so you can tell us everything . "
that they were shown together on tv was to reach at the hearts and minds of people in germany .
it can also be an attempt to reach the german government and put pressure on it to meet their demands by showing that there is older woman there with her son .
are hostages typically aware of the demands and ultimatums that their kidnap per s set ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostages should not give up hope of being set free or rescued no , not really .
some hostage takers would tell the hostages " if our demands are not met we will kill you or harm you in some way . "
that is to put the pressure on the hostages themselves .
since they have allowed them to make two videos , they would have known if the ultimatum was before or after each of the videos .
if their demands are not met the hostage takers may start verbally threatening what they are going to do to them .
if they have been nice to the hostages already , their moods can quickly change if their demands are not met .
but the longer they are held captive the more of a conversation and rapport can open up between the hostages and the hostage takers .
what can that mean for the hostages ?
that can be positive for the hostages .
they can try to talk to the hostage takers .
they know that the hostages have family and , unless the hostage takers turned to terrorism because all their family has been killed , there is a link for conversation .
hostage takers are normally told not to talk to the hostages unless they 're looking for information , but once that barrier is broken there is an opening for a hostage to start talking to the hostage taker .
if there is a rapport between them , it will help the hostages physically and psychologically because they have an outlet and someone to talk to .
what types of effects accompany people who are set free ?
some people take it harder psychologically than others .
people are affected differently by trauma and could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 12.04.2007 opinion : money plus style equals success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fact that three of four champions league semifinalists are english clubs underscores the premier league 's rise to the top .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 12.04.2007 opinion : money plus style equals success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fact that three of four champions league semifinalists are english clubs underscores the premier league 's rise to the top .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says european soccer fans may have to accept a new dynasty . it 's the third time in seven years that one national league has sent three teams to the champions league semi-finals .
spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

" russia and poland have expressed their readiness to be international mediators , " olexander chaly , deputy head of the presidential administration , told reporters . yushchenko cancelled a scheduled trip to address the council of europe in strasbourg on the political crisis , instead sending his foreign minister , arseny yatsenyuk , officials said . a delegation of russian parliamentarians also met deputies from the yanukovych-led governing coalition and voiced their support for the ruling majority 's stand against the president . ukraine must break deadlock , says eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu on the sidelines : solana and co. are staying out meanwhile , the european parliament warned eu institutions not to get involved in ukraine 's political crisis until its own people have had a chance to tackle the issues themselves . " all resources in ukraine should be used to solve the problem , " marek siwiec , the deputy chairman of the european parliament , said .
only after the ukrainian constitutional court has ruled on the legality president yushchenko 's dissolution of a parliament order " can we see whether there is space for european involvement , " he added . " members of the court can not escape their responsibility , " siwiec said .
" i believe ukrainian democracy is able to solve the problem using a word which is not popular , but useful : compromise . " siwiec told a news conference in kiev that , unlike in 2004 when yushchenko won strong , unequivocal western support , this time neither side could expect special treatment .

meanwhile , five judges from the court , three of them yushchenko appointees , said they were being put under undue political pressure . the sevodnya daily said the constitutional court 's decision to delay examining the case played into the hands of yushchenko by " cutting off the retreat for the governing coalition .

to that end , germany should not participate in attempts to establish an international mechanism that would allow exceptions when " diplomatic assurances " are given that a suspect wo n't be tortured , the study said .
" often people are then tortured , despite the diplomatic assurances , " heinz said at a press conference in berlin .
the german institute for human rights also called for the member states of the council of europe , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , to better control the actions of foreign intelligence services on their territories .
more accountability the study recommended the german government and parliament establish an independent body to improve control of the country 's secret services as well as their cooperation with foreign services .
it would be tasked both with investigating human rights abuses as well as preventing them in the future .
the institute also called on germany to stop sending its officials abroad to interrogate prisoners who were being held " in a torture context or in a situation without rights . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2007 report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sking could be a thing of the past in the alps the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- " we want to get china working with the eu on climate change " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders , spoke to dw-radio about her visit and the state of relations between the eu and china .
-lrb- 15.01.2007 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

spain achieved that feat in 2000 , and italy followed suit in 2003 . soccer is a game of streaks , and leagues , just like teams , can go cold as quickly as they get hot .
nonetheless , there are a couple of good reasons to think that english clubs might be ready to take over the game the way they did from 1977 to 1982 , when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa won the old european cup six times on the trot . the first is money .
the premiership changed forever when russian billionaire roman abramovich bought chelsea in 2003 .
abramovich famously pumped hundreds of millions of euros into the club for transfer fees and salaries , and england 's big three - manchester united , liverpool and arsenal - were forced to follow suit . with the twinkle of pound signs in their eyes , the world 's best players now vie to ply their trade on the island .
on the other hand , the premiership is the world 's most popular league , which brings in huge revenues , and forbes magazine lists all four of the clubs named above as among the globe 's 10 richest . moreover , unlike real madrid and barcelona , who also spent big to get good , english clubs have focussed on acquiring a broad range of first-rate talent and not a handful of celebrity names . didier drogba and christiano ronaldo may not be media stars in the sense of david beckham , but you 'd pick either one of them over becks if you were trying to building a champions league-winning squad . that brings us to the style of play in english soccer .
long gone are the days of kick and rush .
these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

these days premiership clubs combine the hard-nosed defense featured in italy in 2003 with the lightning-quick , relentless attacking of the 2000 spanish vintage . man utd started the trend in 1990s , but the quantum leap came in 2003-4 when arsenal , playing a continental style of soccer under french coach arsene wenger , went on an amazing 49-game unbeaten streak . faced with the specter of trophy raising becoming an annual event at highbury , the other elite english clubs revamped their squads and their basic approaches and become more complete teams . the results , as shown by man utd 's 7-1 demolition of as roma in the champions league quarterfinals , can be very frightening indeed . but lest english soccer fans get too euphoric , there 's a rather negative flip-side .
relying as heavily as it does on international talents and influences , the premiership 's current run of excellence is hardly likely to translate into an improvement for the english national squad . thus , while the premiership 's big four may haul some serious silverware in coming international club competitions , there 's little reason to believe that the three lions will reap anything in the euro 2008 or the next world cup but their by-now customary frustration . jefferson chase writes regularly about soccer for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

the united states wants to build a radar station in the czech republic and a missile battery in poland as a shield against possible nuclear attacks from what it calls " rogue states , " namely iran and north korea .
timely precautions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he still believes diplomacy can resolve the tension with iran the controversial plan has met with opposition among the ruling coalition in germany , as well as in russia and central europe .
jung , a christian democrat , is the first high-ranking german official to speak out strongly in favor of the missile shield plan .
" timely precautions must be taken against the foreseeable increase of the range of offensive missiles of certain problem states , even if it concerns long-term developments , " jung told reuters .
though the minister avoided naming iran directly in the interview , it was clear that he had iran as well as north korea in mind .
when asked how close he thought iran was to constructing a nuclear weapon , the defense minister said , " according to expert assessments , iran is years away from that point . "
he added that it was still possible to stop iran from becoming a nuclear power through democracy .
hope for diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has drawn criticism from the west " we can do everything possible to prevent iran from successfully combining long-range missile and atomic weapons , " said jung .
" and i 'm hopeful that we - the united states , europe , russia and china - can achieve this diplomatically . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that his country was now capable of enriching uranium on an " industrial scale . "

the united states wants to build a radar station in the czech republic and a missile battery in poland as a shield against possible nuclear attacks from what it calls " rogue states , " namely iran and north korea .
timely precautions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he still believes diplomacy can resolve the tension with iran the controversial plan has met with opposition among the ruling coalition in germany , as well as in russia and central europe .
jung , a christian democrat , is the first high-ranking german official to speak out strongly in favor of the missile shield plan .
" timely precautions must be taken against the foreseeable increase of the range of offensive missiles of certain problem states , even if it concerns long-term developments , " jung told reuters .
though the minister avoided naming iran directly in the interview , it was clear that he had iran as well as north korea in mind .
when asked how close he thought iran was to constructing a nuclear weapon , the defense minister said , " according to expert assessments , iran is years away from that point . "
he added that it was still possible to stop iran from becoming a nuclear power through democracy .
hope for diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has drawn criticism from the west " we can do everything possible to prevent iran from successfully combining long-range missile and atomic weapons , " said jung .
" and i 'm hopeful that we - the united states , europe , russia and china - can achieve this diplomatically . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that his country was now capable of enriching uranium on an " industrial scale . "
despite un appeals for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program , tehran has insisted that its nuclear activities are intended to generate energy . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us missile shield a trump card in a game of german politics part of germany 's grand coalition , the social democrats , have been accused of banking on anti-us rhetoric to boost their flagging fortunes .

" ambassador zobel has , in many ways , questioned the territorial integrity of serbia and the inviolability of its recognised international borders , " the statement continued .
speaking at a public debate in belgrade on wednesday , zobel said the sensitive issue of kosovo 's status should be solved as soon as possible by granting an internationally-supervised independence to the southern serbian province .

his plan has already been endorsed by kosovo albanians , the european union and the united states but is strongly opposed by moscow and belgrade , which has instead suggested that the province be granted autonomy within serbian borders .
if the kosovo issue was not solved as suggested , " the problems could reappear in vojvodina -lrb- a northern serbian province with a multi-ethnic population -rrb- and sandzak , " a southwestern serbian region with a strong muslim population , zobel was quoted as saying by private radio b92 .

the german embassy in belgrade has meanwhile denied that zobel warned that vojvodina 's future might be on the line , according to a statement quoted by the beta news agency .
the ambassador himself apologised at a brief press conference late thursday " for remarks that might have been incorrectly understood , " b92 reported .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- forecast for europe and the alps is dizzying : more heat waves and drought , more floods as glaciers melt , and the widespread extinction of species as global warming takes effect .
it said sea-level rise in low-lying coastal areas will threaten two and a half million people a year .
the bleak assessment is also not a vision of the future ; scientists say climate change is already occurring in europe .
these specific findings for europe were presented at a press conference on wednesday in geneva , which is home to the united nations climate panel .
thawing of glaciers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november in the alps the ipcc report describes the ongoing thawing of european glaciers and permafrost , the delayed winter freeze of rivers and lakes , the lengthening of growing seasons and the earlier spring arrival of migratory birds .
andreas fischlin , an author of the report , said extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and more lie ahead this century .
summer heat waves will likely occur every other year , and could be responsible for thousands of deaths , just like the heat wave of 2003 , he said .
and , summers will generally become increasingly hotter .
" it has been estimated in the report that in the first two weeks of august in the summer of 2003 in europe , we had 35,000 additional deaths , " fischlin said .
" adaptation will be necessary to address unavoidable impacts . "
up to two degrees warmer in alps the report found that global temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees in the past 100 years .
in comparison , temperatures in the alps have risen by one and a half or two degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glacier melt is already having its effects martin beniston , contributing author to the report , said the effects this degree or two of warming will have on europe 's water resources are immense .
" in climatic terms , anything that takes place in the central part of the alps , which is the source region of many of europe 's river ways will have a significant impact on water resources , " he said .
he said the alps are often referred to as the " water tower of europe " because they funnel water in many directions in different parts of the european continent .
he warned , however , that " not only the alps themselves are impacted , but also the highly populated regions downstream that depend on water resources originating in the alps for drinking water , for energy supply , for agriculture , for industry . "
north to fare better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps may lure more tourists in summer than in winter studies indicate that southern europe will be more severely affected than northern europe .
its already hot and semi-arid climate is expected to become warmer and drier .
more droughts will threaten its water resources , farms and forests .
the ipcc report predicts that europe 's northern regions will have more precipitation and run-off .
this will cause greater flooding , coastal erosion , and loss of species .
scientists say carbon emissions will have to be reduced by more than 50 percent globally in order to stabilize current levels in the atmosphere .
beniston said that any action the eu would take would be helpful , but limited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a normally crowded lift stood still on november 30 , 2006 " the european union is just one entity , " beniston pointed out .
" it 's certainly an important entity in global economic circles , but it 's not the only one .
reducing emissions even by 30 or 40 or 50 percent is still not going to solve the problem , really , but it would be a good step in the right direction . "
the report recommends that certain measures should be taken to address europe 's climate changes : the development of detailed coastal management plans , the expansion of nature reserves to conserve species and the promotion of new tourism activities to replace those that are lost . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

after weathering some early pressure , the italians came alive midway through the first-half as two goals in less than five minutes by clarence seedorf and filippo inzaghi booked milan a semi-final berth against manchester united .
bayern chief franz beckenbauer conceded that milan had been the better of the two sides over the tie .
" i am disappointed because we had a lot of hope after the first leg , " said the world cup winning coach and player .
" however , i have to acknowledge that over the two legs ac milan were the better side .
i think we lacked creativity , " beckenbauer said .

bosnian international hasan salihamidzic came in at right-back for injured argentinian martin demichelis , while owen hargreaves partnered dutchman mark van bommel in midfield .
ac milan were missing cup-tied brazilian ronaldo and italian striker alberto gilardino was suspended after picking up a yellow card in the first leg as the italians .
milan coach carlo ancelotti played a 4-4-1-1 combination with kaka just behind lone striker inzaghi , and it proved to be a winning formation .
drawing blood bildunterschrift : liverpool and psv eindhoven went at it in england on wednesday bayern had several early half-chances and milan had to wait until the 20th minute for their first real opportunity when inzaghi directed a weak header straight into the arms of bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn .
but the guests drew first blood when seedorf drove his shot hard and low past the diving kahn to give the visitors a 1-0 lead after 27 minutes to silence the home fans .
" i am delighted we have qualified and even more so that i scored , " said seedorf .
" we have taken a step towards the final but manchester united know us well , " he warned .
just five minutes after seedorf 's goal the german side suffered a hammer blow when inzaghi was put into space past bayern defender lucio and his powerful shot gave kahn no chance on 31 minutes . ´ podolski 's missed chance at glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's podolski -lrb- r -rrb- ca n't keep up with milan 's nesta lukas podolski squandered a chance to pull a goal back when van bommel 's cross fell at his feet in the six-yard box , but he failed to connect and dida scooped the ball out of danger as the italians went into the break 2-0 ahead .
bayern came out firing after the interval and salihamidzic picked up a yellow-card for a heavy challenge just after the hour mark as his side pushed forward .
the home side camped in the italians half in the dying stages as podolski went close on numerous occasions and substitute striker claudio pizarro hit the side netting with five minutes left .
but it was too little , too late , and milan now face manchester united in the semi-final on april 24/25 for a place in the athens final up for grabs on may 23 .

the united states wants to build a radar station in the czech republic and a missile battery in poland as a shield against possible nuclear attacks from what it calls " rogue states , " namely iran and north korea .
timely precautions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he still believes diplomacy can resolve the tension with iran the controversial plan has met with opposition among the ruling coalition in germany , as well as in russia and central europe .
jung , a christian democrat , is the first high-ranking german official to speak out strongly in favor of the missile shield plan .
" timely precautions must be taken against the foreseeable increase of the range of offensive missiles of certain problem states , even if it concerns long-term developments , " jung told reuters .
though the minister avoided naming iran directly in the interview , it was clear that he had iran as well as north korea in mind .
when asked how close he thought iran was to constructing a nuclear weapon , the defense minister said , " according to expert assessments , iran is years away from that point . "
he added that it was still possible to stop iran from becoming a nuclear power through democracy .
hope for diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has drawn criticism from the west " we can do everything possible to prevent iran from successfully combining long-range missile and atomic weapons , " said jung .
" and i 'm hopeful that we - the united states , europe , russia and china - can achieve this diplomatically . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that his country was now capable of enriching uranium on an " industrial scale . "
despite un appeals for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program , tehran has insisted that its nuclear activities are intended to generate energy . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us missile shield a trump card in a game of german politics part of germany 's grand coalition , the social democrats , have been accused of banking on anti-us rhetoric to boost their flagging fortunes .

" hans filbinger was not a national socialist , " said günther oettinger , the christian democratic premier of the state of baden-württemberg , at the service on wednesday in freiburg .
filbinger , baden-württemberg 's premier from 1966-1978 , died on april 1 at the age of 93 .
he had been a military judge under the nazis and was allegedly responsible for proclaiming death sentences even after germany 's world war ii capitulation .
the christian democrat resigned from office after a 1978 play by rolf hochhuth revealed that he had been involved in sentencing german soldiers to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger -lrb- r . -rrb- and erwin teufel , both successors of filbinger as premier , attended the funeral " there is no sentence from hans filbinger due to which someone lost his life , " oettinger said .
" he did n't have the power to make decisions nor the freedom to make decisions that his critics allege . "
oettinger said filbinger was an opponent of the nazis but was forced to bow to the pressures of the times .
" sadistic nazi " " i find the comment atrocious and it also conveys the wrong message , " responded dieter graumann , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" it glosses over the actual guilt of a man like hans filbinger . "
graumann said it was a fact that filbinger had been involved in sentencing people to death and that he had indeed supported the nazi regime .
" up to the last moment , he did n't recognize that and apparently his successor does n't either , " graumann said .
playwright and author hochhuth deemed oettinger 's comments a " barefaced fabrication " and said it had been proven that filbinger personally killed a man in british captivity , because the judge was a " sadistic nazi .

a caller claiming to represent al-qaeda in the maghreb told an arabic tv channel that his group had carried out the attacks .
there has been no independent verification of the claim .
prime minister abdelaziz belkhadem , who was unharmed , called the attacks a " cowardly and criminal act " .
the official aps agency , quoting the algerian authorities , said at least 12 people were killed and 118 injured in the attack on the government building and 11 people were killed and 44 injured in the second attack , on a police station in the eastern district of bab ezzouar .
' cowardice and betrayal ' the violence in algiers comes a day after the authorities in neighbouring morocco said they had foiled a plot to target foreign and strategic interests by suicide bombers .
three suspects blew themselves up after being pursued by the authorities , and a fourth was shot dead by police .
it also follows clashes with militants in tunisia earlier this year .
violent attacks have been increasing in algeria since the main islamist rebel group , the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , changed its name to the al-qaeda organisation in the islamic maghreb in january . "
this is a crime , a cowardly act " abdelaziz belkhadem algerian prime minister profile : maghreb al-qaeda in pictures : algerian blasts blasts fuel regional fears al-jazeera tv said this was the group that had claimed responsibility for wednesday 's violence .
bbc arab affairs analyst magdi abdelhadi says many analysts will link the surge in violence with the ambitions of the algerian hardline organisation to spread its campaign to neighbouring countries .
the city centre explosion was so loud it could be heard up to 10km -lrb- six miles -rrb- away , residents said .
government employees were injured by flying glass and debris , which spread up to 300m -lrb- yards -rrb- from the site of the blasts .
ambulances went to the scene and police blocked entry to the prime minister 's office , which also houses the offices of the interior minister .
speaking on algerian radio , mr belkhadem denounced the bombings , which come as the government says it is working towards national reconciliation .
" this is a crime , a cowardly act , " mr belkhadem said .
alarm bells our analyst says the attacks are a serious blow for the algerian authorities which have for years fought islamist militants .
despite an amnesty announced two years ago , the violence in algeria has never completely died down since its height in the mid-1990s .
the latest scenes of blood on the streets of algiers will revive painful memories of that civil strife that lasted for a decade and left an estimated 150,000 people dead .
magdi abdelhadi says the spectre of a resurgent al-qaeda operating in north africa , close to europe 's southern border , will send the alarm bells ringing in european capitals .
it may also have a devastating impact on the prospect of more open and democratic societies in the region .
he says that like in other arab states , the authorities have used the threat of terror in the past to curb civil and political freedoms .

a caller claiming to represent al-qaeda in the maghreb told an arabic tv channel that his group had carried out the attacks .
there has been no independent verification of the claim .
prime minister abdelaziz belkhadem , who was unharmed , called the attacks a " cowardly and criminal act " .
the official aps agency , quoting the algerian authorities , said at least 12 people were killed and 118 injured in the attack on the government building and 11 people were killed and 44 injured in the second attack , on a police station in the eastern district of bab ezzouar .
' cowardice and betrayal ' the violence in algiers comes a day after the authorities in neighbouring morocco said they had foiled a plot to target foreign and strategic interests by suicide bombers .
three suspects blew themselves up after being pursued by the authorities , and a fourth was shot dead by police .
it also follows clashes with militants in tunisia earlier this year .
violent attacks have been increasing in algeria since the main islamist rebel group , the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , changed its name to the al-qaeda organisation in the islamic maghreb in january .
this is a crime , a cowardly act abdelaziz belkhadem algerian prime minister profile : maghreb al-qaeda in pictures : algerian blasts blasts fuel regional fears al-jazeera tv said this was the group that had claimed responsibility for wednesday 's violence .
bbc arab affairs analyst magdi abdelhadi says many analysts will link the surge in violence with the ambitions of the algerian hardline organisation to spread its campaign to neighbouring countries .
the city centre explosion was so loud it could be heard up to 10km -lrb- six miles -rrb- away , residents said .
government employees were injured by flying glass and debris , which spread up to 300m -lrb- yards -rrb- from the site of the blasts .
ambulances went to the scene and police blocked entry to the prime minister 's office , which also houses the offices of the interior minister .
speaking on algerian radio , mr belkhadem denounced the bombings , which come as the government says it is working towards national reconciliation .
" this is a crime , a cowardly act , " mr belkhadem said .
alarm bells our analyst says the attacks are a serious blow for the algerian authorities which have for years fought islamist militants .
despite an amnesty announced two years ago , the violence in algeria has never completely died down since its height in the mid-1990s .
the latest scenes of blood on the streets of algiers will revive painful memories of that civil strife that lasted for a decade and left an estimated 150,000 people dead .
magdi abdelhadi says the spectre of a resurgent al-qaeda operating in north africa , close to europe 's southern border , will send the alarm bells ringing in european capitals .
it may also have a devastating impact on the prospect of more open and democratic societies in the region .
he says that like in other arab states , the authorities have used the threat of terror in the past to curb civil and political freedoms .

during a career lasting more than 50 years , kurt vonnegut wrote the classic anti-war novel , slaughterhouse five , detailing his experiences of the allied bombing of dresden in 1945 .
vonnegut had enlisted in the armed services a year after japan 's attack on pearl harbor .
captured by german troops in december 1944 during the battle of the bulge , vonnegut spent the rest of the war imprisoned in a dresden slaughterhouse .
on the night of 13 february 1945 , allied bombing raids flattened the city , creating a firestorm that killed an estimated 35,000 citizens in two hours .
obscenity ban vonnegut and his fellow prisoners were saved by their incarceration in a cold meat locker three storeys beneath ground .
when they ventured out , nothing was left of the city , and their grim task in the aftermath was to uncover the rotting corpses .
vonnegut referred to his experiences of dresden in several of his later novels , most notably slaughterhouse five in 1967 .
science fiction writers are the only ones who care about the future kurt vonnegut its protagonist , billy pilgrim , copes with the trauma of a similar experience by travelling to the planet tralfamadore , whose inhabitants see all time existing simultaneously .
published at the height of the vietnam war , and embraced by the anti-war movement , the book was excluded from some schools and public libraries on obscenity grounds .
' loaded with vulgarity ' during a series of post-war jobs that included working as a police reporter and a public relations official for general electric , vonnegut supplemented his income by publishing short stories .
vonnegut found his fame astonishing his mother had committed suicide on mother 's day 1944 .
she had been trying to make a living through writing magazine articles , and had become increasingly depressed as her hopes were dashed .
vonnegut always said that she lacked the vulgarity needed for such writing , whereas he was " loaded with it " .
lost compulsion to write by 1966 , vonnegut had published more than 50 stories , and had quit the " dishonest " public relations work to write full time .
his first novel , player piano , was published in 1952 .
although it attracted little critical praise , vonnegut had already sounded the ironical and compassionate tone that appeared in much of his work , including the sirens of titan , mother night and the critically-acclaimed cat 's cradle .
vonnegut resisted the science fiction label vonnegut 's self-confessed mood of " high hopes for the planet " , experienced at the dawning of the post-war period , was seen to waver in his later work , including slapstick in 1976 and jailbird in 1979 .
there was less humour in his later novels and plays , and vonnegut attempted suicide during a particularly bleak period in the mid-80s .
although he was writing until his death , he undoubtedly felt his best work had been completed years earlier .
following the publication of slaughterhouse five , he had admitted to losing the compulsion to write .
he likened himself to a flower , which having finished blooming , " has some sort of awareness of some purpose having been served " .
he did come out of semi-retirement to write the short story collection a man without a country in 2006 , saying that he had " drawn energy from my contempt for our president " .
vonnegut said he was often surprised to have lived for so long , having been a heavy smoker .
he once joked : " i 'm suing a cigarette company because on the package they promised to kill me , and yet here i am . "

during a career lasting more than 50 years , kurt vonnegut wrote the classic anti-war novel , slaughterhouse five , detailing his experiences of the allied bombing of dresden in 1945 .
vonnegut had enlisted in the armed services a year after japan 's attack on pearl harbor .
captured by german troops in december 1944 during the battle of the bulge , vonnegut spent the rest of the war imprisoned in a dresden slaughterhouse .
on the night of 13 february 1945 , allied bombing raids flattened the city , creating a firestorm that killed an estimated 35,000 citizens in two hours .
obscenity ban vonnegut and his fellow prisoners were saved by their incarceration in a cold meat locker three storeys beneath ground .
when they ventured out , nothing was left of the city , and their grim task in the aftermath was to uncover the rotting corpses .
vonnegut referred to his experiences of dresden in several of his later novels , most notably slaughterhouse five in 1967 .
science fiction writers are the only ones who care about the future kurt vonnegut its protagonist , billy pilgrim , copes with the trauma of a similar experience by travelling to the planet tralfamadore , whose inhabitants see all time existing simultaneously .
published at the height of the vietnam war , and embraced by the anti-war movement , the book was excluded from some schools and public libraries on obscenity grounds .
' loaded with vulgarity ' during a series of post-war jobs that included working as a police reporter and a public relations official for general electric , vonnegut supplemented his income by publishing short stories .
vonnegut found his fame astonishing his mother had committed suicide on mother 's day 1944 .
she had been trying to make a living through writing magazine articles , and had become increasingly depressed as her hopes were dashed .
vonnegut always said that she lacked the vulgarity needed for such writing , whereas he was " loaded with it " .
lost compulsion to write by 1966 , vonnegut had published more than 50 stories , and had quit the " dishonest " public relations work to write full time .
his first novel , player piano , was published in 1952 .

smg said the move to turn virgin radio into an independent company would allow smg to focus on its tv business , which includes scottish television .
it said income from a flotation would give a strong platform to virgin radio - which has one of the three uk national commercial radio licences .
smg also announced a 50 % fall in pre-tax profits to £ 10m for 2006 .
it also said it had halted the sale of its outdoor advertising business primesight , which owns more than 13,500 large outdoor advertising panels across the uk , because the price it would attract was too low .
however , smg , which is also selling its cinema advertising business pearl & dean , said it would restart the primesight sale when market conditions were better .
' strong and focussed ' smg chairman richard findlay said he was " very excited about both the prospects for virgin radio as an independent company and the turnaround in our core tv business " .
chief executive rob woodward said virgin radio had seen a lot of investment in technology and in hiring broadcasters , and that the float would create " a strong and focussed radio business " .
smg had already warned that its 2006 profits would be down , with tough advertising hitting its stv and ginger productions arms .
group income fell 8 % to £ 147.3m.
the firm added that in the first three months of 2007 , television advertising income had fallen 5 % but said revenue from radio had grown 8 % on the same period a year before .
in february this year , smg broke off merger talks with ulster tv -lrb- utv -rrb- , operator of talksport .
the deal would have created a media group worth about £ 400m .
hiving off virgin radio as a separate business made sense , said hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers analyst keith bowman .
" whilst investor appetite for radio assets is not exactly running high at the moment , due to the challenging advertising backdrop , separate management concentration on two completely different businesses should significantly increase the focus on recovery " .

enthusiastic concert-goers , or prommers , used to queue outside the royal albert hall , where drinks and sandwiches were served from a mobile trolley .
performances continued in other venues , as this flyer for a concert at the royal surrey zoological gardens shows .
elgar 's pomp and circumstance march no. 1 is a favourite at the last night of the proms .
in recent years , the proms has included an open-air concert in london 's hyde park .
the british library 's celebrating the proms exhibition runs until 8 july .

the speed of current services , like bittorrent , is limited by the number of people sharing a specific file , such as a movie or song .
similarity-enhanced transfer -lrb- set -rrb- works by spotting chunks of identical data in files that are an exact or near match to the one needed .
using set the researchers have seen speed increases of up to 500 % .
looks familiar the findings are outlined in a paper , exploiting similarity for multi-source downloads using file handprints , written by david andersen of carnegie mellon university , himabindu pucha , of purdue university , and michael kaminsky of intel research .
current file-sharing systems , like bittorrent work best when there are multiple sources of a specific shared file .
when a file is shared it is divided into chunks and those parcels of data are distributed to groups of people who are searching for that file .
the more sources of those chunks there are , the more information there is that can be sent to a user , resulting in faster download speeds .
identical pieces but these services often fail to deliver fast speeds because there are not enough users sharing the chunks of the specific file wanted .
" a big limitation of bittorrent is that it only lets clients share data if they 're downloading the exact same file , " said professor andersen .
" this means that the available client pool for any particular file is smaller than it needs to be . "
set works faster because the trio realised that many files being shared on the net contain identical pieces of data even though they appear to be different .
professor andersen said he was " shocked " by this discovery .
" in retrospect , of course , the causes of the similarity -lrb- different audio tracks , different artist names , etc . -rrb- make a lot of sense , but i honestly did n't expect it at all , " he told the bbc news website .
the set system assigns files a similarity ranking and can take chunks of data from files which are both identical and similar to the one being searched for .
the lower similarity ranking that set searches for , the more sources for that data are likely to be found .
" the extra overhead of locating these sources does not out-weigh the benefit of using them to help saturate the recipient 's available bandwidth , " wrote the scientists .
" indeed , exploiting similar sources can significantly improve download time , " it added .
set uses a technique called handprinting - which has been used to filter junk e-mails - to seek out files that contain some of the data needed by the one a file-sharing program has requested .
for example , a search for a particular madonna song may result in a wide range of titles because the tags , or labels , have been filled in differently , or incorrectly .
set knows that the music data of a number of differently-labelled madonna songs is identical and that chunks of data from those files can be shared between users .
in tests , set improved the transfer time of an mp3 music file by 71 % and a 55mb movie trailer went 30 % faster using the researchers ' techniques to draw from movie trailers that were 47 % similar .
prof andersen said that set could help most with less popular files .
" it gives clients a larger pool of other clients to draw from , " he said " this probably wo n't matter much for super-popular data , where there is already a huge set of people downloading it , but our experiments suggest that in the other cases , set can help a lot . "
retro-fitting bittorrent to use set could be quite straightforward , said prof andersen , though he added that some of its techniques would need much more work to make it very good at finding files that have some , but not all , of the data that a user wants .
he said he hoped developers would take the ideas and build on them .
" this is a technique that i would like people to steal , " he said and added that he hopes to use set in a service for sharing software or academic papers .
" it would make p2p transfers faster and more efficient , " he added , " and developers should just take the idea and use it in their own systems . "

looks familiar the findings are outlined in a paper , exploiting similarity for multi-source downloads using file handprints , written by david andersen of carnegie mellon university , himabindu pucha , of purdue university , and michael kaminsky of intel research .
current file-sharing systems , like bittorrent work best when there are multiple sources of a specific shared file .
when a file is shared it is divided into chunks and those parcels of data are distributed to groups of people who are searching for that file .
the more sources of those chunks there are , the more information there is that can be sent to a user , resulting in faster download speeds .
identical pieces but these services often fail to deliver fast speeds because there are not enough users sharing the chunks of the specific file wanted .
" a big limitation of bittorrent is that it only lets clients share data if they 're downloading the exact same file , " said professor andersen .
" this means that the available client pool for any particular file is smaller than it needs to be . "
set works faster because the trio realised that many files being shared on the net contain identical pieces of data even though they appear to be different .
professor andersen said he was " shocked " by this discovery .
" in retrospect , of course , the causes of the similarity -lrb- different audio tracks , different artist names , etc . -rrb- make a lot of sense , but i honestly did n't expect it at all , " he told the bbc news website .
the set system assigns files a similarity ranking and can take chunks of data from files which are both identical and similar to the one being searched for .
the lower similarity ranking that set searches for , the more sources for that data are likely to be found .
tv programmes like lost are popular files to share " the extra overhead of locating these sources does not out-weigh the benefit of using them to help saturate the recipient 's available bandwidth , " wrote the scientists .
" indeed , exploiting similar sources can significantly improve download time , " it added .
set uses a technique called handprinting - which has been used to filter junk e-mails - to seek out files that contain some of the data needed by the one a file-sharing program has requested .
for example , a search for a particular madonna song may result in a wide range of titles because the tags , or labels , have been filled in differently , or incorrectly .
set knows that the music data of a number of differently-labelled madonna songs is identical and that chunks of data from those files can be shared between users .
in tests , set improved the transfer time of an mp3 music file by 71 % and a 55mb movie trailer went 30 % faster using the researchers ' techniques to draw from movie trailers that were 47 % similar .
prof andersen said that set could help most with less popular files .
" it gives clients a larger pool of other clients to draw from , " he said " this probably wo n't matter much for super-popular data , where there is already a huge set of people downloading it , but our experiments suggest that in the other cases , set can help a lot . "
retro-fitting bittorrent to use set could be quite straightforward , said prof andersen , though he added that some of its techniques would need much more work to make it very good at finding files that have some , but not all , of the data that a user wants .
he said he hoped developers would take the ideas and build on them .
" this is a technique that i would like people to steal , " he said and added that he hopes to use set in a service for sharing software or academic papers .
" it would make p2p transfers faster and more efficient , " he added , " and developers should just take the idea and use it in their own systems . "

retro-fitting bittorrent to use set could be quite straightforward , said prof andersen , though he added that some of its techniques would need much more work to make it very good at finding files that have some , but not all , of the data that a user wants .
he said he hoped developers would take the ideas and build on them .
" this is a technique that i would like people to steal , " he said and added that he hopes to use set in a service for sharing software or academic papers .
" it would make p2p transfers faster and more efficient , " he added , " and developers should just take the idea and use it in their own systems . "

the speed of current services , like bittorrent , is limited by the number of people sharing a specific file , such as a movie or song .
similarity-enhanced transfer -lrb- set -rrb- works by spotting chunks of identical data in files that are an exact or near match to the one needed .
using set the researchers have seen speed increases of up to 500 % .
looks familiar the findings are outlined in a paper , exploiting similarity for multi-source downloads using file handprints , written by david andersen of carnegie mellon university , himabindu pucha , of purdue university , and michael kaminsky of intel research .
current file-sharing systems , like bittorrent work best when there are multiple sources of a specific shared file .
when a file is shared it is divided into chunks and those parcels of data are distributed to groups of people who are searching for that file .
the more sources of those chunks there are , the more information there is that can be sent to a user , resulting in faster download speeds .
identical pieces but these services often fail to deliver fast speeds because there are not enough users sharing the chunks of the specific file wanted .
" a big limitation of bittorrent is that it only lets clients share data if they 're downloading the exact same file , " said professor andersen .
" this means that the available client pool for any particular file is smaller than it needs to be . "
set works faster because the trio realised that many files being shared on the net contain identical pieces of data even though they appear to be different .
professor andersen said he was " shocked " by this discovery .
" in retrospect , of course , the causes of the similarity -lrb- different audio tracks , different artist names , etc . -rrb- make a lot of sense , but i honestly did n't expect it at all , " he told the bbc news website .
the set system assigns files a similarity ranking and can take chunks of data from files which are both identical and similar to the one being searched for .
the lower similarity ranking that set searches for , the more sources for that data are likely to be found .
tv programmes like lost are popular files to share " the extra overhead of locating these sources does not out-weigh the benefit of using them to help saturate the recipient 's available bandwidth , " wrote the scientists .
" indeed , exploiting similar sources can significantly improve download time , " it added .
set uses a technique called handprinting - which has been used to filter junk e-mails - to seek out files that contain some of the data needed by the one a file-sharing program has requested .
for example , a search for a particular madonna song may result in a wide range of titles because the tags , or labels , have been filled in differently , or incorrectly .
set knows that the music data of a number of differently-labelled madonna songs is identical and that chunks of data from those files can be shared between users .
in tests , set improved the transfer time of an mp3 music file by 71 % and a 55mb movie trailer went 30 % faster using the researchers ' techniques to draw from movie trailers that were 47 % similar .
prof andersen said that set could help most with less popular files .
" it gives clients a larger pool of other clients to draw from , " he said " this probably wo n't matter much for super-popular data , where there is already a huge set of people downloading it , but our experiments suggest that in the other cases , set can help a lot . "

" it would make p2p transfers faster and more efficient , " he added , " and developers should just take the idea and use it in their own systems . "
