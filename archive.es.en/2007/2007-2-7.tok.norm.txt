kiev expressed disappointment that it does not open the door to eu membership for the former soviet state . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , was joined by representatives from the european commission and council for the formal start of negotiations during a one-day visit to kiev on tuesday . prime minister viktor yanukovich promised to press on with political and economic reforms to foster closer ties with the eu .
but he expressed frustration that foreign ministers from the bloc last month had stopped short of promising ukraine membership one day . " there was a certain amount of disappointment among citizens of ukraine , " he said at a joint press conference with steinmeier .
he added that the bloc should remain open to all european states that " respect the rule of law . " steinmeier assured yanukovich that the eu considered ukraine a " unique and important country " in its neighborhood policy , which calls for closer ties with states to the east and south of the bloc .
contingent on reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister said the country would join the wto next year the two officials failed to announce a timeframe for the negotiations , but yanukovich said he was aware that the pace of ukrainian reforms was key . " we hope that we will be able to negotiate over a new enhanced agreement in a speedy and efficient way , " he said . the eu partnership and cooperation agreement with ukraine will replace a treaty that was signed in 1998 and is due to expire next year .
it will allow stronger cooperation on security policy , justice issues , gas and oil transit and visa policy as well expanding free trade between ukraine and the bloc . the final component is dependent on ukraine joining the world trade organization , which yanukovich said should happen by mid-2007 . the eu is keen to promote the " western orientation " of ukraine , which has been embroiled in a power struggle between pro-russian and pro-western forces since its so-called " orange revolution " in 2004 .
eu divided over ukraine joining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko was one of the leaders of ukraine 's orange revolution but the issue of whether the new pact will include the prospect of eventual eu membership for ukraine has divided the bloc .
eu foreign ministers papered over the differences in conclusions of a brussels meeting last month , saying that the bloc remained committed to supporting ukraine 's democracy , stability and prosperity and " wishes to reinforce this commitment through a new enhanced agreement . "
they acknowledged ukraine 's " european aspirations " but said that " a new enhanced agreement shall not prejudge any possible future developments in eu-ukraine relations . "
britain , hungary , poland and sweden support kiev 's ambition to join europe 's rich club .
but a number of the 27 current member states - including germany , france and spain - are fiercely opposed . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has pressed for accession talks to start next year , but eu leaders said at the last eu-ukraine summit , in october , that the country has not undertaken enough reforms to be a contender . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers discuss iran , ukraine , northern cyprus eu foreign ministers have released their conclusions after meeting in brussels , calling on countries to enforce iran sanctions , pledging stronger ties with ukraine and moving towards freer trade with northern cyprus .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .

" the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .
" but chairman oberstar is not willing to make that sacrifice of our domestic control over domestic airlines , " he stressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .
and it should help to relieve pressure from critics within nato who accuse germany of letting other nations do all the fighting . nina werkhäuser is a dw political journalist in berlin . -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .
-lrb- 07.02.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .

they can be a very obedient folk . according to the reuters news agency , more than 100 german housing association tenants are sticking to tough new rules governing how they live . germans are long accustomed to being told what color the roof must be , how they can paint the walls or what times of the day they are allowed to drill and hammer , but some renters are finding themselves confronted with an entirely new set of rules . the tenants have agreed not to use all the space in their apartments to avoid being forced to move out . the local housing authority in the eastern town of löbau said last week the new regulations stipulate that the tenants - who all live on welfare - now qualify only for smaller abodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other four rooms are empty there 's just one glitch , though . " the recipients are only allowed apartments of a certain size , but there are n't enough smaller apartments available , " said matthias urbansky , head of the local housing authority . faced with nowhere else to go , the tenants are being allowed to stay in their current apartments , so long as the space they use does not exceed the new limit . settling into no man 's land " the people involved seem to be quite happy with the new setup , " urbansky said . he was quick to add that housing inspectors pay regular visits to ensure that the tenants ' possessions are n't encroaching on the off-limit space . but not everyone sees the sense of inhabiting an apartment with no-go areas . " it feels silly not being able to go into all the rooms of your apartment any more , " one 49-year-old woman was quoted as saying in the dresdner morgenpost newspaper . then again , the tenants could look at the new arrangement as an exercise in minimalism .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism . " achieving these aims would require massive investment and innovation that pose enormous and extremely difficult challenges for all manufacturers , " said bernd gottschalk , the federation 's president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said he is pleased with the compromise carbon dioxide emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . the proposal is set for debate is set for debate in the european parliament and the governments of the bloc 's 27 member states .
signaling tough negotiations ahead in the eu 's law-making assembly , green party representatives said on wednesday that the commission 's proposal confirmed that the demands of the german car industry had taken priority over tackling climate change . " by scaling back its proposals on co2 emissions from cars , the commission has once again confirmed that the bottom line of the german car industry takes priority over tackling climate change , " green member of the european parliament claude turmes said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission wants strict limits on carbon dioxide emissions the european commission has now sparked a hefty dispute with the european automobile industry by demanding that carbon dioxide emissions from cars be eliminated -lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism .

transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . the proposal is set for debate is set for debate in the european parliament and the governments of the bloc 's 27 member states .
signaling tough negotiations ahead in the eu 's law-making assembly , green party representatives said on wednesday that the commission 's proposal confirmed that the demands of the german car industry had taken priority over tackling climate change . " by scaling back its proposals on co2 emissions from cars , the commission has once again confirmed that the bottom line of the german car industry takes priority over tackling climate change , " green member of the european parliament claude turmes said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission wants strict limits on carbon dioxide emissions the european commission has now sparked a hefty dispute with the european automobile industry by demanding that carbon dioxide emissions from cars be eliminated -lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

making cakes - and eating them too , of course - are a long-standing tradition and many german cake recipes are known around the world . when one of germany ’ s most well-known musicians and entertainers calls himself a " singing herrentorte , " you know that germans take their traditions seriously . and when you find out that the recipe for black forest cake is actually regulated by the state , you start to get the picture that baking is no laughing matter for germans . tastes and traditions from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black forest cake is a german specialty afternoon coffee and cake may be a german tradition , but the art of cake making dates back to the confectioners at the courts of the french kings .
the artistic preparation of fruit pastes originated in the arab countries and came to germany via italy .
according to old records , cakes have been baked in germany for over 400 years . there are countless different kinds of cakes and pastries in german patisseries and cafes - from the infamous black forest cake and other traditional cakes like herrentorte , baumkuchen , frankfurter kranz and dresdner christstollen , to the various different kinds of strudel and pastries adorned with fresh fruits . some confectioners and coffee houses may appear rather outdated and arguably over-elegant these days , but the granny image certainly has not rubbed off on the cakes themselves .
coffee and cake remains a tradition dear to german hearts and , despite the coffee-to-go trend , cake knives continue to be on the bestseller lists in house ware shops . if i 'd known you were coming … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't need a special occasion to make a cake perhaps this all has something to do with the fact that invitations to " coffee and cake " on a sunday afternoon are as widespread as they are beloved . ernie in the children ’ s program sesame street sings , " if i ’ d known you were coming , i would have baked you a cake . "
and baking someone a cake - whether it ’ s for a wedding , a birthday , or just because - is something that transcends generations and is a typically german gesture . and let ’ s not forget that germany not only played host to last year ’ s soccer world cup , it also organized the confectioners world cup as well . andrea rummel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden fruitcake : germany 's secret weapon the " dresdner stollen , " a christmas treat made exclusively in the eastern german city , has its supporters around the world .
but anti-terrorism laws in the us make it harder for americans to get their fruitcake fix .

in particular the food standards agency advice is that there is no risk in eating any sort of properly cooked poultry including turkey and eggs . " eu checks defenses it 's not yet known how the disease arrived in britain but veterinary experts investigating the infection suspect it was brought in by wild birds .

despite the swift british action to contain the virus , japan , russia , the ukraine , hong kong , south korea , south africa and jersey have all slapped import bans on british poultry , although consumers in britain appear to have remained calm , with poultry sales remaining stable . last year , the french were more fearful .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .
eu members france and spain have recently signed such accords with senegal , the jumping off point for many desperate immigrants heading for spain 's canary islands . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin and paris suggest new model for eu migration french and german interior ministers have proposed a new eu migration policy from the european union 's six largest countries .

that 's down to what many consider a golden generation of players . ahead of their friendly with germany in dortmund on wednesday , the swiss had lots of reasons for optimism .
the squad can draw on players from some of the biggest and best clubs in europe - olympique lyon and arsenal to name just two . 2008 may be switzerland 's best shot ever at a major title .
as co-hosts of the european championships , together with austria , they will have the considerable advantage of playing in front of home crowds . and because host countries automatically qualify for the tournament , switzerland can spend 2007 fine-tuning their squad without having to worry about getting results . that 's got their coach , jakob " köbi " kuhn , setting his sights high .
" we 're playing to win in 2008 , " kuhn says - a statement that not too long ago would have sounded ridiculous for a nation whose sporting triumphs usually come on slopes of snow , not fields of grass . youthful success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philippe senderos is n't afraid of hard-nosed action striker tranquillo barnetta and philippe senderos know what it 's like to take home a trophy .
both were members of the swiss junior team that won the european under-17 championships in 2002 . kuhn is hoping that his golden generation , now its twenties , has matured enough to compete against europe 's bigger sides at the adult level .
" germany is a strong opponent , " kuhn told the german soccer magazine kicker ahead of the two countries ' friendly .
" we 'll know more about where we stand after the match . " at the 2006 world cup , switzerland showed it can hold its own , progressing to the knock-out round of the tournament without conceding a goal . their main achilles ' heel was from the spot .
the swiss exited the world cup in a penalty shoot-out against ukraine - after failing to convert a single chance .
coincidentally that match also took place in dortmund . germany lose klose for clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose headed back to bremen for treatment miroslav klose will miss the friendly against switzerland as he has failed to recover from a thumb injury , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed wednesday . the absence of the werder bremen striker , who picked up the injury in sunday 's defeat to schalke 04 , and the suspended lukas podolski means that coach joachim löw is likely to start with schalke 's kevin kuranyi and vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke up front . klose fell on his thumb during training tuesday evening which resulted in swelling .
the dfb medical team decided not to risk the player and he returned to bremen for treatment . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coach hoping for quick euro qualification for the first time in four years the german national side goes into the new year without the challenge of a major tournament to look forward to .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .
" but chairman oberstar is not willing to make that sacrifice of our domestic control over domestic airlines , " he stressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .
eu members france and spain have recently signed such accords with senegal , the jumping off point for many desperate immigrants heading for spain 's canary islands . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin and paris suggest new model for eu migration french and german interior ministers have proposed a new eu migration policy from the european union 's six largest countries .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .

making cakes - and eating them too , of course - are a long-standing tradition and many german cake recipes are known around the world . when one of germany ’ s most well-known musicians and entertainers calls himself a " singing herrentorte , " you know that germans take their traditions seriously . and when you find out that the recipe for black forest cake is actually regulated by the state , you start to get the picture that baking is no laughing matter for germans . tastes and traditions from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black forest cake is a german specialty afternoon coffee and cake may be a german tradition , but the art of cake making dates back to the confectioners at the courts of the french kings .
the artistic preparation of fruit pastes originated in the arab countries and came to germany via italy .
according to old records , cakes have been baked in germany for over 400 years . there are countless different kinds of cakes and pastries in german patisseries and cafes - from the infamous black forest cake and other traditional cakes like herrentorte , baumkuchen , frankfurter kranz and dresdner christstollen , to the various different kinds of strudel and pastries adorned with fresh fruits . some confectioners and coffee houses may appear rather outdated and arguably over-elegant these days , but the granny image certainly has not rubbed off on the cakes themselves .
coffee and cake remains a tradition dear to german hearts and , despite the coffee-to-go trend , cake knives continue to be on the bestseller lists in house ware shops . if i 'd known you were coming … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't need a special occasion to make a cake perhaps this all has something to do with the fact that invitations to " coffee and cake " on a sunday afternoon are as widespread as they are beloved . ernie in the children ’ s program sesame street sings , " if i ’ d known you were coming , i would have baked you a cake . "
and baking someone a cake - whether it ’ s for a wedding , a birthday , or just because - is something that transcends generations and is a typically german gesture . and let ’ s not forget that germany not only played host to last year ’ s soccer world cup , it also organized the confectioners world cup as well . andrea rummel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden fruitcake : germany 's secret weapon the " dresdner stollen , " a christmas treat made exclusively in the eastern german city , has its supporters around the world .

boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .

making cakes - and eating them too , of course - are a long-standing tradition and many german cake recipes are known around the world . when one of germany ’ s most well-known musicians and entertainers calls himself a " singing herrentorte , " you know that germans take their traditions seriously . and when you find out that the recipe for black forest cake is actually regulated by the state , you start to get the picture that baking is no laughing matter for germans . tastes and traditions from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black forest cake is a german specialty afternoon coffee and cake may be a german tradition , but the art of cake making dates back to the confectioners at the courts of the french kings .
the artistic preparation of fruit pastes originated in the arab countries and came to germany via italy .
according to old records , cakes have been baked in germany for over 400 years . there are countless different kinds of cakes and pastries in german patisseries and cafes - from the infamous black forest cake and other traditional cakes like herrentorte , baumkuchen , frankfurter kranz and dresdner christstollen , to the various different kinds of strudel and pastries adorned with fresh fruits . some confectioners and coffee houses may appear rather outdated and arguably over-elegant these days , but the granny image certainly has not rubbed off on the cakes themselves .
coffee and cake remains a tradition dear to german hearts and , despite the coffee-to-go trend , cake knives continue to be on the bestseller lists in house ware shops . if i 'd known you were coming … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't need a special occasion to make a cake perhaps this all has something to do with the fact that invitations to " coffee and cake " on a sunday afternoon are as widespread as they are beloved . ernie in the children ’ s program sesame street sings , " if i ’ d known you were coming , i would have baked you a cake . "
and baking someone a cake - whether it ’ s for a wedding , a birthday , or just because - is something that transcends generations and is a typically german gesture . and let ’ s not forget that germany not only played host to last year ’ s soccer world cup , it also organized the confectioners world cup as well . andrea rummel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden fruitcake : germany 's secret weapon the " dresdner stollen , " a christmas treat made exclusively in the eastern german city , has its supporters around the world .

the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency . germany plans to deploy between six and eight of the aircraft and up to 500 soldiers to man them . the german parliament - or bundestag - needs to approve the mission , but this is considered a formality given the huge majority enjoyed by chancellor angela merkel 's government in the bundestag . " i hope for the bundestag 's full support , " said defence minister franz josef jung .
parliament is to decide by early march . jung said that if the legislature gives the green light for the mission , the tornados could be in afghanistan by mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundeswehr soldier as part of isaf in afghanistan government sources said the cabinet had ruled out sending the fighter jets into combat .
they will be used to provide the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- with images of taliban activities . jung stressed that the use of the jets for intelligence would also help to protect german soldiers . furthermore , he said , " without security there can be no reconstruction -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , and without reconstruction there will be no security . " flights over southern afghanistan nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has requested the tornados to fly support missions over southern afghanistan for nato ground forces amid fears of a taliban offensive as spring approaches . government sources said tornado reconnaissance planes would operate across the entire country , taking aerial pictures of tailban positions and passing the information on to other nato partners who would carry out strikes against the taliban . the six-month tour will cost germany an estimated 35 million euros -lrb- $ 45.3 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung -rrb- germany has about 2,700 troops serving with the 35,000-member nato force in afghanistan , but they are mainly restricted to serving in the relatively peaceful northern part of the country . with more than 4,000 people killed in violence , last year was the bloodiest in afghanistan since us-led forces toppled the taliban government in 2001 . germany has been seeking to expand its role in overseas missions in the last decade , but many germans are uncomfortable about the emergence of a strong army in a country still grappling with its nazi past . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de will germany join the fight against the taliban ?

the news web site spiegel online quoted police sources as saying the paper showed a hand-drawn map of the scene of the crime .
three apartments belonging to the vietnamese men in bremen and nearby ahlhorn were subsequently searched . the suspects are refusing to cooperate with police .

they claim the cartoons are as offensive as holocaust denial . this week in the land of voltaire a civil court will debate where free speech and religious sensitivities overlap .
the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .
boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .

“ we support charlie hebdo in its commitment to free expression and to the right to satire and we condemn the many different kinds of intimidation that have been targeted at this weekly , ” the organisation said in it 's statement .

dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .
and it should help to relieve pressure from critics within nato who accuse germany of letting other nations do all the fighting . nina werkhäuser is a dw political journalist in berlin . -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .
-lrb- 07.02.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .

they claim the cartoons are as offensive as holocaust denial . this week in the land of voltaire a civil court will debate where free speech and religious sensitivities overlap .
the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .
boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .
courts in france , which observes a strict separation of church and state in the public sphere , have repeatedly defended free speech rights against religious objections .
the catholic church failed in recent years to win court injunctions against a film poster with a cross formed like a swastika and a fashion ad with scantily clad women posing like jesus and his apostles in da vinci 's painting the last supper . charlie has many friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartoons have triggered world-wide debate on freedom of speech politicians , intellectuals , secular muslims and left-wing pressure groups have also lined up behind the magazine , arguing that muslim groups have no right to call for limits on free speech . " i just can not imagine the consequences not only for france but for denmark and europe if they lose the case , " fleming rose , the danish editor who first published the cartoons , told a news conference with charlie hebdo publisher philippe val .
" it would turn back the clock decades , ages . " the organisation reporters without borders has also voiced unconditional support for charlie hebdo , in a statement released on tuesday .
“ we support charlie hebdo in its commitment to free expression and to the right to satire and we condemn the many different kinds of intimidation that have been targeted at this weekly , ” the organisation said in it 's statement .
“ the public area must remain open not only to dialogue but also to controversy . ” media rage in an act of solidarity with charlie hebdo , french newspaper liberation printed the contested cartoons once more on wednesday : " it is not words which wound , or pictures that kill .
it is bombs , " the daily said , calling the trial " idiotic " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moslems reacted violently to the original publication a televised debate between charlie hebdo publisher val and boubakeur broke down in acrimony on feb .
6 after they squabbled over the limits of free speech .
" if we ca n't criticise religion anymore , there will be no women 's rights , no birth control and no gay rights , " val said in the raucous tv debate . however it appears the general public may see things differently .
in a french opinion poll conducted on feb .
6 showed 79 percent thought it unacceptable to ridicule a religion publicly and 78 percent ruled out parodies of jesus christ , mohammad or buddha . legal confusion the paris court will hear the case on wednesday and thursday , and issue its ruling at a later date .
the plaintiffs are requesting 30,000 euros in damages and the publication of key passages from the court ’ s ruling .
the editors of jyllands-posten were acquitted in october 2006 of any wrongdoing in a separate case in a danish court and very few editors among the dozens of newspapers worldwide that re-printed the cartoons have faced legal action .
a russian editor of a small newspaper was fined 100,000 roubles -lrb- 3,000 euros -rrb- in april last year and convicted of inciting religious hatred for publishing one of the cartoons . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed continues to simmer as more muslim countries join the fray .

" the british want to see more of it , because the germans tell stories that everyone can identify with - even abroad , " said iris ordonez , the company 's representative in britain .

german productions get more attention abroad than ever as a new film culture - often referred to as " new german wave " or " berlin school " - emerged over the last view years . german films have also won more awards internationally than ever before .
" good bye , lenin ! " and " head-on " consecutively received the european film award , followed by " the lives of others " in 2006 .
two years earlier , " the edukators " became the first german movie in a long time to be chosen for the official competition at the cannes film festival .

they want to depict reality - without make-up , without knick-knack and without artificiality .
they 're saving on dialogue , gestures and wild cuts .
dramatic moments are often presented in a quiet and casual way .
it 's a strong characteristic that 's valued abroad . what 's decisive is that the films deal with universal subjects such as immigration , fear of social decline and nationalism , but also love and friendship that touch people around the world . not bigger than life film director matthias luthardt 's award-winning " pingpong , " for example , shows a seemingly happy family and the internal and external forces that weigh it down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 07.02.2007 eu backs down on climate limits to please auto industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers threatened job cuts if limits are too strict big carmakers have won a partial victory in amending an eu plan to cap carbon-dioxide -lrb- c02 -rrb- emissions , but failing to move with the times could ultimately harm the industry . despite failing to meet its own voluntary targets to reduce carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from new cars , big carmakers , in particular in the german auto industry , have succeeded in forcing the eu to lower its mandatory limits . while european union environment commissioner stavros dimas wanted carmakers to achieve an average emissions target of 120 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 , the final proposal sets a legally binding limit of 130 grams per kilometer .
the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism . " achieving these aims would require massive investment and innovation that pose enormous and extremely difficult challenges for all manufacturers , " said bernd gottschalk , the federation 's president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said he is pleased with the compromise carbon dioxide emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . the proposal is set for debate is set for debate in the european parliament and the governments of the bloc 's 27 member states .
signaling tough negotiations ahead in the eu 's law-making assembly , green party representatives said on wednesday that the commission 's proposal confirmed that the demands of the german car industry had taken priority over tackling climate change . " by scaling back its proposals on co2 emissions from cars , the commission has once again confirmed that the bottom line of the german car industry takes priority over tackling climate change , " green member of the european parliament claude turmes said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission wants strict limits on carbon dioxide emissions the european commission has now sparked a hefty dispute with the european automobile industry by demanding that carbon dioxide emissions from cars be eliminated -lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

they can be a very obedient folk . according to the reuters news agency , more than 100 german housing association tenants are sticking to tough new rules governing how they live . germans are long accustomed to being told what color the roof must be , how they can paint the walls or what times of the day they are allowed to drill and hammer , but some renters are finding themselves confronted with an entirely new set of rules . the tenants have agreed not to use all the space in their apartments to avoid being forced to move out . the local housing authority in the eastern town of löbau said last week the new regulations stipulate that the tenants - who all live on welfare - now qualify only for smaller abodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other four rooms are empty there 's just one glitch , though . " the recipients are only allowed apartments of a certain size , but there are n't enough smaller apartments available , " said matthias urbansky , head of the local housing authority . faced with nowhere else to go , the tenants are being allowed to stay in their current apartments , so long as the space they use does not exceed the new limit . settling into no man 's land " the people involved seem to be quite happy with the new setup , " urbansky said . he was quick to add that housing inspectors pay regular visits to ensure that the tenants ' possessions are n't encroaching on the off-limit space . but not everyone sees the sense of inhabiting an apartment with no-go areas . " it feels silly not being able to go into all the rooms of your apartment any more , " one 49-year-old woman was quoted as saying in the dresdner morgenpost newspaper . then again , the tenants could look at the new arrangement as an exercise in minimalism .

dramatic moments are often presented in a quiet and casual way .
it 's a strong characteristic that 's valued abroad . what 's decisive is that the films deal with universal subjects such as immigration , fear of social decline and nationalism , but also love and friendship that touch people around the world . not bigger than life film director matthias luthardt 's award-winning " pingpong , " for example , shows a seemingly happy family and the internal and external forces that weigh it down .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism . " achieving these aims would require massive investment and innovation that pose enormous and extremely difficult challenges for all manufacturers , " said bernd gottschalk , the federation 's president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said he is pleased with the compromise carbon dioxide emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . the proposal is set for debate is set for debate in the european parliament and the governments of the bloc 's 27 member states .
signaling tough negotiations ahead in the eu 's law-making assembly , green party representatives said on wednesday that the commission 's proposal confirmed that the demands of the german car industry had taken priority over tackling climate change . " by scaling back its proposals on co2 emissions from cars , the commission has once again confirmed that the bottom line of the german car industry takes priority over tackling climate change , " green member of the european parliament claude turmes said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission wants strict limits on carbon dioxide emissions the european commission has now sparked a hefty dispute with the european automobile industry by demanding that carbon dioxide emissions from cars be eliminated -lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism . " achieving these aims would require massive investment and innovation that pose enormous and extremely difficult challenges for all manufacturers , " said bernd gottschalk , the federation 's president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said he is pleased with the compromise carbon dioxide emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . the proposal is set for debate is set for debate in the european parliament and the governments of the bloc 's 27 member states .

dw-world.de readers have also been discussing germany 's role in the war-torn country . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germany should just say " no " to the american military when they ask it to send more troops to afghanistan .
it does n't have to fight their wars for them . - james wilder , us germany should stick to her more peaceful of mandate winning the hearts of the afghan people .
having to send combat planes means somebody miscalculated the situation and wants germany to be pulled into a dangerously escalating combat situation . - g. gosau , canada germany is a member of nato and nato has made a commitment to fight the taliban in afghanistan .
therefore , germany should send anything required to combat this threat to europe and the nato states .
nato has depended for too long on the united states to do much of the dirty work in defense of europe .
it 's about time europe began to learn once again about the ugly business of defending itself from foreign threats .
europeans -lrb- including germans -rrb- believe that everything can be solved with diplomacy .
americans learned the value of diplomacy with islamic fundamentalists after the failed foreign policies of the clinton administration which culminated with 9/11 after he left office .
i hope europe never has to learn the lesson the way america did . - martin peterson , texas , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornado fighter jets are intended for reconnaissance purposes let the us be the world cops .
i am tired of the middle east and the crazy people that live there .
let them kill each other if they want . - ryan fischer , canada do n't you send planes to a war zone to kill people ?
that does not sound like today 's germany . - john philippen the war in afghanistan is a great opportunity for germany .
it is an opportunity to join the anglo-american alliance .
this was a dream of bismarck and could propel germany to the leadership of europe .
the german people should not sit on the fence . - charles ritzel i feel personally that , instead of deploying troops , it is better to solve the conflicts with negotiations and peaceful means .
the problem in afghanistan is war .
the common people have been suffering due to the war for the last 28 years and almost a whole generation has been born in this ugly period of war in and around afghanistan .
who can know better than the german themselves the effects of war and living a life under the clouds of arms and ammunitions ?
germans have helped the afghani people a lot by hosting a number of afghani refugees .
one clear sign of this help and generosity can be seen in two of the ministers in the present afghan government .
both lived in refuge in germany during the hard times of their life .
instead of sending more troops and spending more money on guns and bombs , it 's better to help by building new factories and production plants so as to engage the afghanis in normal life and enable them to live with dignity . - suhail kureishi compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .

the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency . germany plans to deploy between six and eight of the aircraft and up to 500 soldiers to man them . the german parliament - or bundestag - needs to approve the mission , but this is considered a formality given the huge majority enjoyed by chancellor angela merkel 's government in the bundestag . " i hope for the bundestag 's full support , " said defence minister franz josef jung .
parliament is to decide by early march . jung said that if the legislature gives the green light for the mission , the tornados could be in afghanistan by mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundeswehr soldier as part of isaf in afghanistan government sources said the cabinet had ruled out sending the fighter jets into combat .
they will be used to provide the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- with images of taliban activities . jung stressed that the use of the jets for intelligence would also help to protect german soldiers . furthermore , he said , " without security there can be no reconstruction -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , and without reconstruction there will be no security . " flights over southern afghanistan nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has requested the tornados to fly support missions over southern afghanistan for nato ground forces amid fears of a taliban offensive as spring approaches . government sources said tornado reconnaissance planes would operate across the entire country , taking aerial pictures of tailban positions and passing the information on to other nato partners who would carry out strikes against the taliban . the six-month tour will cost germany an estimated 35 million euros -lrb- $ 45.3 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung -rrb- germany has about 2,700 troops serving with the 35,000-member nato force in afghanistan , but they are mainly restricted to serving in the relatively peaceful northern part of the country . with more than 4,000 people killed in violence , last year was the bloodiest in afghanistan since us-led forces toppled the taliban government in 2001 . germany has been seeking to expand its role in overseas missions in the last decade , but many germans are uncomfortable about the emergence of a strong army in a country still grappling with its nazi past . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de will germany join the fight against the taliban ?

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .
eu members france and spain have recently signed such accords with senegal , the jumping off point for many desperate immigrants heading for spain 's canary islands . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin and paris suggest new model for eu migration french and german interior ministers have proposed a new eu migration policy from the european union 's six largest countries .
the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time .
-lrb- 27.10.2006 -rrb- illegal migration high on new eu presidency 's agenda with germany now president of the european union , the city of dresden hosts the first informal meeting of eu interior and justice ministers of the new presidency monday .
illegal migration is high on the agenda .

that 's down to what many consider a golden generation of players . ahead of their friendly with germany in dortmund on wednesday , the swiss had lots of reasons for optimism .
the squad can draw on players from some of the biggest and best clubs in europe - olympique lyon and arsenal to name just two . 2008 may be switzerland 's best shot ever at a major title .
as co-hosts of the european championships , together with austria , they will have the considerable advantage of playing in front of home crowds . and because host countries automatically qualify for the tournament , switzerland can spend 2007 fine-tuning their squad without having to worry about getting results . that 's got their coach , jakob " köbi " kuhn , setting his sights high .
" we 're playing to win in 2008 , " kuhn says - a statement that not too long ago would have sounded ridiculous for a nation whose sporting triumphs usually come on slopes of snow , not fields of grass . youthful success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philippe senderos is n't afraid of hard-nosed action striker tranquillo barnetta and philippe senderos know what it 's like to take home a trophy .
both were members of the swiss junior team that won the european under-17 championships in 2002 . kuhn is hoping that his golden generation , now its twenties , has matured enough to compete against europe 's bigger sides at the adult level .
" germany is a strong opponent , " kuhn told the german soccer magazine kicker ahead of the two countries ' friendly .
" we 'll know more about where we stand after the match . " at the 2006 world cup , switzerland showed it can hold its own , progressing to the knock-out round of the tournament without conceding a goal . their main achilles ' heel was from the spot .
the swiss exited the world cup in a penalty shoot-out against ukraine - after failing to convert a single chance .
coincidentally that match also took place in dortmund . germany lose klose for clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose headed back to bremen for treatment miroslav klose will miss the friendly against switzerland as he has failed to recover from a thumb injury , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed wednesday . the absence of the werder bremen striker , who picked up the injury in sunday 's defeat to schalke 04 , and the suspended lukas podolski means that coach joachim löw is likely to start with schalke 's kevin kuranyi and vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke up front . klose fell on his thumb during training tuesday evening which resulted in swelling .

dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .
and it should help to relieve pressure from critics within nato who accuse germany of letting other nations do all the fighting . nina werkhäuser is a dw political journalist in berlin . -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .
-lrb- 07.02.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- minister wo n't rule out deploying troops to afghanistan 's south just days before the german government decides whether to allow its tornado jets to patrol in southern afghanistan , defense minister jung said he would not rule out sending troops to the relatively more violent south .

the news web site spiegel online quoted police sources as saying the paper showed a hand-drawn map of the scene of the crime .
three apartments belonging to the vietnamese men in bremen and nearby ahlhorn were subsequently searched . the suspects are refusing to cooperate with police .

several witnesses claimed to have seen a car on sunday of the same description as that of the two men , police said .
identities remain unclear three men and three women were found tied up and shot dead in the restaurant in the early hours of monday , while a man found at the scene with serious gunshot wounds died of his injuries in hospital on tuesday . four of the seven victims have been identified .
they included the owners of the restaurant , a hong kong chinese couple who were british passport holders .
he was aged 36 , she was 28 . their two-year-old daughter was found unharmed at the restaurant and was in good health , police said . a 36-year-old woman of malaysian origin who worked as a waitress at the restaurant was also among the dead .
her husband had raised the alarm when he arrived at the restaurant to pick up his wife from work . the other victim was a 31-year-old thai man from wolfenbüttel . the identity of the remaining three dead is still being established .
investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals planned to hold memorial service on wednesday for the victims the police have refused to respond to speculation on whether a gang was responsible for the killings or possible motives .
they said the investigation was exploring all possibilities .
" but they are now concentrated on the two suspects as well as the roughly 100 tip-offs from the population so far , " said chief investigator andreas tschirner of the state crime office in hanover , which took over the case on wednesday . the restaurant had been popular in sittensen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.02.2007 " some regions can only be secured by force " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday the german cabinet agreed to propose using bundeswehr tornados to help nato combat the taliban in southern afghanistan .
dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .
and it should help to relieve pressure from critics within nato who accuse germany of letting other nations do all the fighting . nina werkhäuser is a dw political journalist in berlin . -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .
-lrb- 07.02.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- minister wo n't rule out deploying troops to afghanistan 's south just days before the german government decides whether to allow its tornado jets to patrol in southern afghanistan , defense minister jung said he would not rule out sending troops to the relatively more violent south .

the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools .

boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .

" paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .
boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .

in particular the food standards agency advice is that there is no risk in eating any sort of properly cooked poultry including turkey and eggs . " eu checks defenses it 's not yet known how the disease arrived in britain but veterinary experts investigating the infection suspect it was brought in by wild birds .

despite the swift british action to contain the virus , japan , russia , the ukraine , hong kong , south korea , south africa and jersey have all slapped import bans on british poultry , although consumers in britain appear to have remained calm , with poultry sales remaining stable . last year , the french were more fearful .

" ' the risk to the general public is judged by health experts to be negligible .
in particular the food standards agency advice is that there is no risk in eating any sort of properly cooked poultry including turkey and eggs . " eu checks defenses it 's not yet known how the disease arrived in britain but veterinary experts investigating the infection suspect it was brought in by wild birds .
in the wake of the recent infections eu veterinary experts were reviewing europe 's defences against the deadly virus amid fears that it could spread across the 27-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird flu has been most devasting in asia the european commission voiced satisfaction on monday with british authorities ' handling of the outbreak , which under eu rules adopted in february last year , authorities are supposed to set up a three-kilometre -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometre surveillance zone around the site of an outbreak .
meanwhile , infected birds must be culled , other farmers are to keep poultry indoors and strict movement controls are put in place . deadly strain the h5n1 strain of avian influenza can be transmitted to humans and has killed more than 164 people worldwide since 2003 , with indonesia being the worst hit .
eu health commissioner markos kyprianou stressed to the community that although other outbreaks among birds were likely in the eu , a human pandemic was not about to sweep across the continent , and authorities were ready to respond to any outbreaks . " we should never feel that we are safe in a sense of having eradicated it but we have the system in place , " commissioner kyprianou said . bad for business bird flu also has severe economic consequences .
despite the swift british action to contain the virus , japan , russia , the ukraine , hong kong , south korea , south africa and jersey have all slapped import bans on british poultry , although consumers in britain appear to have remained calm , with poultry sales remaining stable . last year , the french were more fearful .
when the virus was discovered on a turkey farm near lyon in february 2006 , sales plunged by a third , and did n't recover until july . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu is now back in the headlines here in europe with britain slaughtering tens of thousands of turkeys the disease was discovered at a factory farm in the east of england last week .
british officials are insisting that the outbreak of the deadly h5n1 virus appears to have been confined to the farm .
-lrb- 05.02.2007 -rrb- health experts urge eu to prepare for more bird flu cases health experts met to review how well the eu is prepared for an outbreak of avian influenza and what can be done to limit the damage if this happens .
-lrb- 01.10.2006 -rrb- the return of bird flu has europe on alert as british authorities said they were nearly finished gassing some 160,000 birds on monday , officials around europe were concerned the potentially lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu could spread across the continent .

the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency . germany plans to deploy between six and eight of the aircraft and up to 500 soldiers to man them . the german parliament - or bundestag - needs to approve the mission , but this is considered a formality given the huge majority enjoyed by chancellor angela merkel 's government in the bundestag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.02.2007 " some regions can only be secured by force " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday the german cabinet agreed to propose using bundeswehr tornados to help nato combat the taliban in southern afghanistan .
dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .
and it should help to relieve pressure from critics within nato who accuse germany of letting other nations do all the fighting . nina werkhäuser is a dw political journalist in berlin . -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .

making cakes - and eating them too , of course - are a long-standing tradition and many german cake recipes are known around the world . when one of germany ’ s most well-known musicians and entertainers calls himself a " singing herrentorte , " you know that germans take their traditions seriously . and when you find out that the recipe for black forest cake is actually regulated by the state , you start to get the picture that baking is no laughing matter for germans . tastes and traditions from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black forest cake is a german specialty afternoon coffee and cake may be a german tradition , but the art of cake making dates back to the confectioners at the courts of the french kings .
the artistic preparation of fruit pastes originated in the arab countries and came to germany via italy .
according to old records , cakes have been baked in germany for over 400 years . there are countless different kinds of cakes and pastries in german patisseries and cafes - from the infamous black forest cake and other traditional cakes like herrentorte , baumkuchen , frankfurter kranz and dresdner christstollen , to the various different kinds of strudel and pastries adorned with fresh fruits . some confectioners and coffee houses may appear rather outdated and arguably over-elegant these days , but the granny image certainly has not rubbed off on the cakes themselves .
coffee and cake remains a tradition dear to german hearts and , despite the coffee-to-go trend , cake knives continue to be on the bestseller lists in house ware shops . if i 'd known you were coming … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't need a special occasion to make a cake perhaps this all has something to do with the fact that invitations to " coffee and cake " on a sunday afternoon are as widespread as they are beloved . ernie in the children ’ s program sesame street sings , " if i ’ d known you were coming , i would have baked you a cake . "
and baking someone a cake - whether it ’ s for a wedding , a birthday , or just because - is something that transcends generations and is a typically german gesture . and let ’ s not forget that germany not only played host to last year ’ s soccer world cup , it also organized the confectioners world cup as well . andrea rummel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden fruitcake : germany 's secret weapon the " dresdner stollen , " a christmas treat made exclusively in the eastern german city , has its supporters around the world .

that 's down to what many consider a golden generation of players . ahead of their friendly with germany in dortmund on wednesday , the swiss had lots of reasons for optimism .
the squad can draw on players from some of the biggest and best clubs in europe - olympique lyon and arsenal to name just two . 2008 may be switzerland 's best shot ever at a major title .
as co-hosts of the european championships , together with austria , they will have the considerable advantage of playing in front of home crowds . and because host countries automatically qualify for the tournament , switzerland can spend 2007 fine-tuning their squad without having to worry about getting results . that 's got their coach , jakob " köbi " kuhn , setting his sights high .
" we 're playing to win in 2008 , " kuhn says - a statement that not too long ago would have sounded ridiculous for a nation whose sporting triumphs usually come on slopes of snow , not fields of grass . youthful success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philippe senderos is n't afraid of hard-nosed action striker tranquillo barnetta and philippe senderos know what it 's like to take home a trophy .
both were members of the swiss junior team that won the european under-17 championships in 2002 . kuhn is hoping that his golden generation , now its twenties , has matured enough to compete against europe 's bigger sides at the adult level .
" germany is a strong opponent , " kuhn told the german soccer magazine kicker ahead of the two countries ' friendly .
" we 'll know more about where we stand after the match . " at the 2006 world cup , switzerland showed it can hold its own , progressing to the knock-out round of the tournament without conceding a goal . their main achilles ' heel was from the spot .
the swiss exited the world cup in a penalty shoot-out against ukraine - after failing to convert a single chance .
coincidentally that match also took place in dortmund . germany lose klose for clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose headed back to bremen for treatment miroslav klose will miss the friendly against switzerland as he has failed to recover from a thumb injury , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed wednesday . the absence of the werder bremen striker , who picked up the injury in sunday 's defeat to schalke 04 , and the suspended lukas podolski means that coach joachim löw is likely to start with schalke 's kevin kuranyi and vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke up front . klose fell on his thumb during training tuesday evening which resulted in swelling .

the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency . germany plans to deploy between six and eight of the aircraft and up to 500 soldiers to man them . the german parliament - or bundestag - needs to approve the mission , but this is considered a formality given the huge majority enjoyed by chancellor angela merkel 's government in the bundestag . " i hope for the bundestag 's full support , " said defence minister franz josef jung .
parliament is to decide by early march . jung said that if the legislature gives the green light for the mission , the tornados could be in afghanistan by mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundeswehr soldier as part of isaf in afghanistan government sources said the cabinet had ruled out sending the fighter jets into combat .
they will be used to provide the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- with images of taliban activities . jung stressed that the use of the jets for intelligence would also help to protect german soldiers . furthermore , he said , " without security there can be no reconstruction -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , and without reconstruction there will be no security . " flights over southern afghanistan nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer has requested the tornados to fly support missions over southern afghanistan for nato ground forces amid fears of a taliban offensive as spring approaches . government sources said tornado reconnaissance planes would operate across the entire country , taking aerial pictures of tailban positions and passing the information on to other nato partners who would carry out strikes against the taliban . the six-month tour will cost germany an estimated 35 million euros -lrb- $ 45.3 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung -rrb- germany has about 2,700 troops serving with the 35,000-member nato force in afghanistan , but they are mainly restricted to serving in the relatively peaceful northern part of the country . with more than 4,000 people killed in violence , last year was the bloodiest in afghanistan since us-led forces toppled the taliban government in 2001 . germany has been seeking to expand its role in overseas missions in the last decade , but many germans are uncomfortable about the emergence of a strong army in a country still grappling with its nazi past . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- minister wo n't rule out deploying troops to afghanistan 's south just days before the german government decides whether to allow its tornado jets to patrol in southern afghanistan , defense minister jung said he would not rule out sending troops to the relatively more violent south .
-lrb- 05.02.2007 -rrb- nato requests german tornados for southern afghanistan german lawmakers are continuing to debate statements made by the government earlier this week saying berlin was ready to contribute tornado reconnaissance planes to nato ’ s afghanistan stabilization force .

he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .

kiev expressed disappointment that it does not open the door to eu membership for the former soviet state . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , was joined by representatives from the european commission and council for the formal start of negotiations during a one-day visit to kiev on tuesday . prime minister viktor yanukovich promised to press on with political and economic reforms to foster closer ties with the eu .
but he expressed frustration that foreign ministers from the bloc last month had stopped short of promising ukraine membership one day . " there was a certain amount of disappointment among citizens of ukraine , " he said at a joint press conference with steinmeier .
he added that the bloc should remain open to all european states that " respect the rule of law . " steinmeier assured yanukovich that the eu considered ukraine a " unique and important country " in its neighborhood policy , which calls for closer ties with states to the east and south of the bloc .
contingent on reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister said the country would join the wto next year the two officials failed to announce a timeframe for the negotiations , but yanukovich said he was aware that the pace of ukrainian reforms was key . " we hope that we will be able to negotiate over a new enhanced agreement in a speedy and efficient way , " he said . the eu partnership and cooperation agreement with ukraine will replace a treaty that was signed in 1998 and is due to expire next year .
it will allow stronger cooperation on security policy , justice issues , gas and oil transit and visa policy as well expanding free trade between ukraine and the bloc . the final component is dependent on ukraine joining the world trade organization , which yanukovich said should happen by mid-2007 . the eu is keen to promote the " western orientation " of ukraine , which has been embroiled in a power struggle between pro-russian and pro-western forces since its so-called " orange revolution " in 2004 .
eu divided over ukraine joining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko was one of the leaders of ukraine 's orange revolution but the issue of whether the new pact will include the prospect of eventual eu membership for ukraine has divided the bloc .
eu foreign ministers papered over the differences in conclusions of a brussels meeting last month , saying that the bloc remained committed to supporting ukraine 's democracy , stability and prosperity and " wishes to reinforce this commitment through a new enhanced agreement . "
they acknowledged ukraine 's " european aspirations " but said that " a new enhanced agreement shall not prejudge any possible future developments in eu-ukraine relations . "
britain , hungary , poland and sweden support kiev 's ambition to join europe 's rich club .
but a number of the 27 current member states - including germany , france and spain - are fiercely opposed . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has pressed for accession talks to start next year , but eu leaders said at the last eu-ukraine summit , in october , that the country has not undertaken enough reforms to be a contender . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers discuss iran , ukraine , northern cyprus eu foreign ministers have released their conclusions after meeting in brussels , calling on countries to enforce iran sanctions , pledging stronger ties with ukraine and moving towards freer trade with northern cyprus .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .
" but chairman oberstar is not willing to make that sacrifice of our domestic control over domestic airlines , " he stressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .
" but chairman oberstar is not willing to make that sacrifice of our domestic control over domestic airlines , " he stressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

" the british want to see more of it , because the germans tell stories that everyone can identify with - even abroad , " said iris ordonez , the company 's representative in britain .
" it 's not about pretty tales , but about life as it is . " major shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cast of " the edukators " in cannes germany 's film industry is indeed undergoing a major shake-up for the first time in probably two decades .
german productions get more attention abroad than ever as a new film culture - often referred to as " new german wave " or " berlin school " - emerged over the last view years . german films have also won more awards internationally than ever before .
" good bye , lenin ! " and " head-on " consecutively received the european film award , followed by " the lives of others " in 2006 .
two years earlier , " the edukators " became the first german movie in a long time to be chosen for the official competition at the cannes film festival . " the downfall , " " sophie scholl : the final days " and " the story of the weeping camel " all received oscar nomination , with caroline link actually taking home the trophy for " nowhere in africa . "
this year , " the lives of others " might follow suit . movies without make-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from christian petzold 's " ghosts " many young film directors are not interested in making major movies along the lines of hollywood blockbusters , but focus on authentic stories in their films .
they want to depict reality - without make-up , without knick-knack and without artificiality .
they 're saving on dialogue , gestures and wild cuts .
dramatic moments are often presented in a quiet and casual way .
it 's a strong characteristic that 's valued abroad . what 's decisive is that the films deal with universal subjects such as immigration , fear of social decline and nationalism , but also love and friendship that touch people around the world . not bigger than life film director matthias luthardt 's award-winning " pingpong , " for example , shows a seemingly happy family and the internal and external forces that weigh it down .
the film 's been successful with international audiences in cannes , prague and kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " eden , " charlotte roche presented a rather unusual , but not unrealistic way to eat berries and cream " stories about everyday life do well abroad , " he said .

they can be a very obedient folk . according to the reuters news agency , more than 100 german housing association tenants are sticking to tough new rules governing how they live . germans are long accustomed to being told what color the roof must be , how they can paint the walls or what times of the day they are allowed to drill and hammer , but some renters are finding themselves confronted with an entirely new set of rules . the tenants have agreed not to use all the space in their apartments to avoid being forced to move out . the local housing authority in the eastern town of löbau said last week the new regulations stipulate that the tenants - who all live on welfare - now qualify only for smaller abodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other four rooms are empty there 's just one glitch , though . " the recipients are only allowed apartments of a certain size , but there are n't enough smaller apartments available , " said matthias urbansky , head of the local housing authority . faced with nowhere else to go , the tenants are being allowed to stay in their current apartments , so long as the space they use does not exceed the new limit . settling into no man 's land " the people involved seem to be quite happy with the new setup , " urbansky said . he was quick to add that housing inspectors pay regular visits to ensure that the tenants ' possessions are n't encroaching on the off-limit space . but not everyone sees the sense of inhabiting an apartment with no-go areas .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .

they claim the cartoons are as offensive as holocaust denial . this week in the land of voltaire a civil court will debate where free speech and religious sensitivities overlap .
the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .
boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .
courts in france , which observes a strict separation of church and state in the public sphere , have repeatedly defended free speech rights against religious objections .
the catholic church failed in recent years to win court injunctions against a film poster with a cross formed like a swastika and a fashion ad with scantily clad women posing like jesus and his apostles in da vinci 's painting the last supper . charlie has many friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartoons have triggered world-wide debate on freedom of speech politicians , intellectuals , secular muslims and left-wing pressure groups have also lined up behind the magazine , arguing that muslim groups have no right to call for limits on free speech . " i just can not imagine the consequences not only for france but for denmark and europe if they lose the case , " fleming rose , the danish editor who first published the cartoons , told a news conference with charlie hebdo publisher philippe val .
" it would turn back the clock decades , ages . " the organisation reporters without borders has also voiced unconditional support for charlie hebdo , in a statement released on tuesday .
“ we support charlie hebdo in its commitment to free expression and to the right to satire and we condemn the many different kinds of intimidation that have been targeted at this weekly , ” the organisation said in it 's statement .
“ the public area must remain open not only to dialogue but also to controversy . ” media rage in an act of solidarity with charlie hebdo , french newspaper liberation printed the contested cartoons once more on wednesday : " it is not words which wound , or pictures that kill .
it is bombs , " the daily said , calling the trial " idiotic " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moslems reacted violently to the original publication a televised debate between charlie hebdo publisher val and boubakeur broke down in acrimony on feb .
6 after they squabbled over the limits of free speech .
" if we ca n't criticise religion anymore , there will be no women 's rights , no birth control and no gay rights , " val said in the raucous tv debate . however it appears the general public may see things differently .
in a french opinion poll conducted on feb .
6 showed 79 percent thought it unacceptable to ridicule a religion publicly and 78 percent ruled out parodies of jesus christ , mohammad or buddha . legal confusion the paris court will hear the case on wednesday and thursday , and issue its ruling at a later date .
the plaintiffs are requesting 30,000 euros in damages and the publication of key passages from the court ’ s ruling .
the editors of jyllands-posten were acquitted in october 2006 of any wrongdoing in a separate case in a danish court and very few editors among the dozens of newspapers worldwide that re-printed the cartoons have faced legal action .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism . " achieving these aims would require massive investment and innovation that pose enormous and extremely difficult challenges for all manufacturers , " said bernd gottschalk , the federation 's president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said he is pleased with the compromise carbon dioxide emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .
eu members france and spain have recently signed such accords with senegal , the jumping off point for many desperate immigrants heading for spain 's canary islands . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin and paris suggest new model for eu migration french and german interior ministers have proposed a new eu migration policy from the european union 's six largest countries .
the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .

before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .

making cakes - and eating them too , of course - are a long-standing tradition and many german cake recipes are known around the world . when one of germany ’ s most well-known musicians and entertainers calls himself a " singing herrentorte , " you know that germans take their traditions seriously . and when you find out that the recipe for black forest cake is actually regulated by the state , you start to get the picture that baking is no laughing matter for germans . tastes and traditions from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black forest cake is a german specialty afternoon coffee and cake may be a german tradition , but the art of cake making dates back to the confectioners at the courts of the french kings .
the artistic preparation of fruit pastes originated in the arab countries and came to germany via italy .
according to old records , cakes have been baked in germany for over 400 years . there are countless different kinds of cakes and pastries in german patisseries and cafes - from the infamous black forest cake and other traditional cakes like herrentorte , baumkuchen , frankfurter kranz and dresdner christstollen , to the various different kinds of strudel and pastries adorned with fresh fruits . some confectioners and coffee houses may appear rather outdated and arguably over-elegant these days , but the granny image certainly has not rubbed off on the cakes themselves .
coffee and cake remains a tradition dear to german hearts and , despite the coffee-to-go trend , cake knives continue to be on the bestseller lists in house ware shops . if i 'd known you were coming … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't need a special occasion to make a cake perhaps this all has something to do with the fact that invitations to " coffee and cake " on a sunday afternoon are as widespread as they are beloved . ernie in the children ’ s program sesame street sings , " if i ’ d known you were coming , i would have baked you a cake . "
and baking someone a cake - whether it ’ s for a wedding , a birthday , or just because - is something that transcends generations and is a typically german gesture . and let ’ s not forget that germany not only played host to last year ’ s soccer world cup , it also organized the confectioners world cup as well . andrea rummel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden fruitcake : germany 's secret weapon the " dresdner stollen , " a christmas treat made exclusively in the eastern german city , has its supporters around the world .
but anti-terrorism laws in the us make it harder for americans to get their fruitcake fix .

" ' the risk to the general public is judged by health experts to be negligible .
in particular the food standards agency advice is that there is no risk in eating any sort of properly cooked poultry including turkey and eggs . " eu checks defenses it 's not yet known how the disease arrived in britain but veterinary experts investigating the infection suspect it was brought in by wild birds .
in the wake of the recent infections eu veterinary experts were reviewing europe 's defences against the deadly virus amid fears that it could spread across the 27-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird flu has been most devasting in asia the european commission voiced satisfaction on monday with british authorities ' handling of the outbreak , which under eu rules adopted in february last year , authorities are supposed to set up a three-kilometre -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometre surveillance zone around the site of an outbreak .
meanwhile , infected birds must be culled , other farmers are to keep poultry indoors and strict movement controls are put in place . deadly strain the h5n1 strain of avian influenza can be transmitted to humans and has killed more than 164 people worldwide since 2003 , with indonesia being the worst hit .
eu health commissioner markos kyprianou stressed to the community that although other outbreaks among birds were likely in the eu , a human pandemic was not about to sweep across the continent , and authorities were ready to respond to any outbreaks . " we should never feel that we are safe in a sense of having eradicated it but we have the system in place , " commissioner kyprianou said . bad for business bird flu also has severe economic consequences .
despite the swift british action to contain the virus , japan , russia , the ukraine , hong kong , south korea , south africa and jersey have all slapped import bans on british poultry , although consumers in britain appear to have remained calm , with poultry sales remaining stable . last year , the french were more fearful .
when the virus was discovered on a turkey farm near lyon in february 2006 , sales plunged by a third , and did n't recover until july . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu is now back in the headlines here in europe with britain slaughtering tens of thousands of turkeys the disease was discovered at a factory farm in the east of england last week .
british officials are insisting that the outbreak of the deadly h5n1 virus appears to have been confined to the farm .
-lrb- 05.02.2007 -rrb- health experts urge eu to prepare for more bird flu cases health experts met to review how well the eu is prepared for an outbreak of avian influenza and what can be done to limit the damage if this happens .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism .

transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . the proposal is set for debate is set for debate in the european parliament and the governments of the bloc 's 27 member states .
signaling tough negotiations ahead in the eu 's law-making assembly , green party representatives said on wednesday that the commission 's proposal confirmed that the demands of the german car industry had taken priority over tackling climate change .

the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism .

transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

two years earlier , " the edukators " became the first german movie in a long time to be chosen for the official competition at the cannes film festival . " the downfall , " " sophie scholl : the final days " and " the story of the weeping camel " all received oscar nomination , with caroline link actually taking home the trophy for " nowhere in africa . "
this year , " the lives of others " might follow suit . movies without make-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from christian petzold 's " ghosts " many young film directors are not interested in making major movies along the lines of hollywood blockbusters , but focus on authentic stories in their films .
they want to depict reality - without make-up , without knick-knack and without artificiality .
they 're saving on dialogue , gestures and wild cuts .
dramatic moments are often presented in a quiet and casual way .
it 's a strong characteristic that 's valued abroad . what 's decisive is that the films deal with universal subjects such as immigration , fear of social decline and nationalism , but also love and friendship that touch people around the world . not bigger than life film director matthias luthardt 's award-winning " pingpong , " for example , shows a seemingly happy family and the internal and external forces that weigh it down .
the film 's been successful with international audiences in cannes , prague and kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " eden , " charlotte roche presented a rather unusual , but not unrealistic way to eat berries and cream " stories about everyday life do well abroad , " he said .
" the films that have been produced in germany in the last couple of years are not bigger than life , but simply recount reality . " people simply want to identify with characters in movies , said michael hofmann , whose film " eden " about an eccentric chef was screened at the london festival . " people are basically not that different , " he said .
" there has to be something universal that connects us all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 07.02.2007 french satire mag in court over reprinted mohammad cartoons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rage against the cartoons went around the world in a civil action , muslim groups have taken a french satire magazine to court for reprinting the controversial danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad .
they claim the cartoons are as offensive as holocaust denial . this week in the land of voltaire a civil court will debate where free speech and religious sensitivities overlap .
the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .
boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .
courts in france , which observes a strict separation of church and state in the public sphere , have repeatedly defended free speech rights against religious objections .
the catholic church failed in recent years to win court injunctions against a film poster with a cross formed like a swastika and a fashion ad with scantily clad women posing like jesus and his apostles in da vinci 's painting the last supper . charlie has many friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartoons have triggered world-wide debate on freedom of speech politicians , intellectuals , secular muslims and left-wing pressure groups have also lined up behind the magazine , arguing that muslim groups have no right to call for limits on free speech . " i just can not imagine the consequences not only for france but for denmark and europe if they lose the case , " fleming rose , the danish editor who first published the cartoons , told a news conference with charlie hebdo publisher philippe val .
" it would turn back the clock decades , ages . " the organisation reporters without borders has also voiced unconditional support for charlie hebdo , in a statement released on tuesday .
“ we support charlie hebdo in its commitment to free expression and to the right to satire and we condemn the many different kinds of intimidation that have been targeted at this weekly , ” the organisation said in it 's statement .
“ the public area must remain open not only to dialogue but also to controversy . ” media rage in an act of solidarity with charlie hebdo , french newspaper liberation printed the contested cartoons once more on wednesday : " it is not words which wound , or pictures that kill .
it is bombs , " the daily said , calling the trial " idiotic " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moslems reacted violently to the original publication a televised debate between charlie hebdo publisher val and boubakeur broke down in acrimony on feb .
6 after they squabbled over the limits of free speech .
" if we ca n't criticise religion anymore , there will be no women 's rights , no birth control and no gay rights , " val said in the raucous tv debate . however it appears the general public may see things differently .
in a french opinion poll conducted on feb .
6 showed 79 percent thought it unacceptable to ridicule a religion publicly and 78 percent ruled out parodies of jesus christ , mohammad or buddha . legal confusion the paris court will hear the case on wednesday and thursday , and issue its ruling at a later date .

dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .
and it should help to relieve pressure from critics within nato who accuse germany of letting other nations do all the fighting . nina werkhäuser is a dw political journalist in berlin . -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .
-lrb- 07.02.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- minister wo n't rule out deploying troops to afghanistan 's south just days before the german government decides whether to allow its tornado jets to patrol in southern afghanistan , defense minister jung said he would not rule out sending troops to the relatively more violent south .

the news web site spiegel online quoted police sources as saying the paper showed a hand-drawn map of the scene of the crime .
three apartments belonging to the vietnamese men in bremen and nearby ahlhorn were subsequently searched . the suspects are refusing to cooperate with police .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.02.2007 " some regions can only be secured by force " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday the german cabinet agreed to propose using bundeswehr tornados to help nato combat the taliban in southern afghanistan .
dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .
and it should help to relieve pressure from critics within nato who accuse germany of letting other nations do all the fighting . nina werkhäuser is a dw political journalist in berlin . -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .
-lrb- 07.02.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- minister wo n't rule out deploying troops to afghanistan 's south just days before the german government decides whether to allow its tornado jets to patrol in southern afghanistan , defense minister jung said he would not rule out sending troops to the relatively more violent south .

americans learned the value of diplomacy with islamic fundamentalists after the failed foreign policies of the clinton administration which culminated with 9/11 after he left office .
i hope europe never has to learn the lesson the way america did . - martin peterson , texas , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornado fighter jets are intended for reconnaissance purposes let the us be the world cops .

let them kill each other if they want . - ryan fischer , canada do n't you send planes to a war zone to kill people ?
that does not sound like today 's germany . - john philippen the war in afghanistan is a great opportunity for germany .
it is an opportunity to join the anglo-american alliance .
this was a dream of bismarck and could propel germany to the leadership of europe .
the german people should not sit on the fence . - charles ritzel i feel personally that , instead of deploying troops , it is better to solve the conflicts with negotiations and peaceful means .
the problem in afghanistan is war .
the common people have been suffering due to the war for the last 28 years and almost a whole generation has been born in this ugly period of war in and around afghanistan .
who can know better than the german themselves the effects of war and living a life under the clouds of arms and ammunitions ?
germans have helped the afghani people a lot by hosting a number of afghani refugees .
one clear sign of this help and generosity can be seen in two of the ministers in the present afghan government .
both lived in refuge in germany during the hard times of their life .
instead of sending more troops and spending more money on guns and bombs , it 's better to help by building new factories and production plants so as to engage the afghanis in normal life and enable them to live with dignity . - suhail kureishi compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .

dw 's nina werkhäuser says that was the only responsible decision . it would have been impossible to refuse .
nato needs reconnaissance planes in afghanistan and asked germany for help .
german tornado jets are among the best of their kind , able to take detailed pictures from very high altitudes , and that 's essential for identifying enemy positions on the ground . taliban forces pose a very real danger to nato in southern and eastern afghanistan .
last year , canada alone lost 36 troops .
it would have been very difficult for germany to justify turning its back on its allies after they had requested assistance . the isaf troops in afghanistan will only be successful if the various countries in nato cooperate .
this is not to say that the bundeswehr has n't helped in afghanistan .
on the contrary , the 3,000 german soldiers stationed there have done a good job of maintaining order in the relatively peaceful north , which is the mandate they received from nato and the bundestag . but it would be too simple to hide behind regional responsibility .
isaf is extending its presence in afghanistan step by step , and that requires changes in strategy .
nato generals have to react when british , canadian and dutch troops encounter taliban resistance in the south .
that 's why they have requested more troops and more support from other countries . cooperation in nato is a perennial problem since individual members are guided by national concerns .
many members , including germany , have specific national rules about how and when troops can be deployed .
that has to change . the german tornados will only be identifying targets , not doing any bombing , but , of course , they will be involved in combat activities .
that 's why the issue has proved contentious in germany , where critics would like to restrict the bundeswehr to a kind of robust aid organization .
but ensuring the security of nato forces has always been part of the bundeswehr mandate , and that is precisely what the tornados will be doing with their reconnaissance photos . it is entirely correct that germany should emphasis the reconstruction element of its presence in afghanistan .
but some regions can only be protected by force from taliban resurgence . the german government can thank its lucky stars that it 's been able to block requests to transfer bundeswehr ground troops to southern afghanistan .
the deployment of tornados allows berlin to show it is taking responsibility without assuming any huge risks .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down . " not only is the car industry failing on its voluntary commitment to cut co2 emissions , the commission now wants to reward this failure with a weaker fuel-efficiency target , " a spokesperson for the european federation for transport and environment said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c02 emissions from vehicles have skyrocketed since 1990 the claims were rejected by eu industry commissioner günther verheugen .
he said the scheme was the " most ambitious " of its kind in the world . the german commissioner added that even though consumers kept buying gas-guzzlers , " that does n't relieve car makers from their obligation to help fight climate change . "
the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism . " achieving these aims would require massive investment and innovation that pose enormous and extremely difficult challenges for all manufacturers , " said bernd gottschalk , the federation 's president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said he is pleased with the compromise carbon dioxide emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . the proposal is set for debate is set for debate in the european parliament and the governments of the bloc 's 27 member states .
signaling tough negotiations ahead in the eu 's law-making assembly , green party representatives said on wednesday that the commission 's proposal confirmed that the demands of the german car industry had taken priority over tackling climate change . " by scaling back its proposals on co2 emissions from cars , the commission has once again confirmed that the bottom line of the german car industry takes priority over tackling climate change , " green member of the european parliament claude turmes said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission wants strict limits on carbon dioxide emissions the european commission has now sparked a hefty dispute with the european automobile industry by demanding that carbon dioxide emissions from cars be eliminated -lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

the paper call for a further 10 grams per kilometer to be cut through improvements of car fleets and use of bio-fuels , the commission said . greens seeing red environmentalists have slammed the eu 's decision to back down .

the average emission level for european cars sold in 2005 was 162 grams of co2 per kilometer , and europe 's car industry looks almost certain of failing to fulfill its voluntary agreement to cut emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 . serious discord in eu the commission proposals were due to be made two weeks ago , but were postponed at the last minute in order to the rifts the issue has created within the 27-member european union executive . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel all argued that the eu plan would force them to cut jobs or move to cheaper nations to cope with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . the german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- greeted the commission proposals with skepticism .

transport is the one sector of the european economy where co2 emissions have been rising rapidly in recent years , growing from 21 percent to 28 percent of the total between 1990 and 2004 .
passenger cars are responsible for more than half of these emissions . refusal to change threatens opportunity german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called it " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she added . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of germany 's opposition greens , urged the car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

signaling tough negotiations ahead in the eu 's law-making assembly , green party representatives said on wednesday that the commission 's proposal confirmed that the demands of the german car industry had taken priority over tackling climate change .

" the british want to see more of it , because the germans tell stories that everyone can identify with - even abroad , " said iris ordonez , the company 's representative in britain .
" it 's not about pretty tales , but about life as it is . " major shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cast of " the edukators " in cannes germany 's film industry is indeed undergoing a major shake-up for the first time in probably two decades .
german productions get more attention abroad than ever as a new film culture - often referred to as " new german wave " or " berlin school " - emerged over the last view years . german films have also won more awards internationally than ever before .
" good bye , lenin ! " and " head-on " consecutively received the european film award , followed by " the lives of others " in 2006 .
two years earlier , " the edukators " became the first german movie in a long time to be chosen for the official competition at the cannes film festival .

this year , " the lives of others " might follow suit . movies without make-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from christian petzold 's " ghosts " many young film directors are not interested in making major movies along the lines of hollywood blockbusters , but focus on authentic stories in their films .
they want to depict reality - without make-up , without knick-knack and without artificiality .
they 're saving on dialogue , gestures and wild cuts .
dramatic moments are often presented in a quiet and casual way .
it 's a strong characteristic that 's valued abroad . what 's decisive is that the films deal with universal subjects such as immigration , fear of social decline and nationalism , but also love and friendship that touch people around the world . not bigger than life film director matthias luthardt 's award-winning " pingpong , " for example , shows a seemingly happy family and the internal and external forces that weigh it down .
the film 's been successful with international audiences in cannes , prague and kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " eden , " charlotte roche presented a rather unusual , but not unrealistic way to eat berries and cream " stories about everyday life do well abroad , " he said .
" the films that have been produced in germany in the last couple of years are not bigger than life , but simply recount reality . " people simply want to identify with characters in movies , said michael hofmann , whose film " eden " about an eccentric chef was screened at the london festival . " people are basically not that different , " he said .

" the british want to see more of it , because the germans tell stories that everyone can identify with - even abroad , " said iris ordonez , the company 's representative in britain .
" it 's not about pretty tales , but about life as it is . " major shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cast of " the edukators " in cannes germany 's film industry is indeed undergoing a major shake-up for the first time in probably two decades .
german productions get more attention abroad than ever as a new film culture - often referred to as " new german wave " or " berlin school " - emerged over the last view years . german films have also won more awards internationally than ever before .
" good bye , lenin ! " and " head-on " consecutively received the european film award , followed by " the lives of others " in 2006 .
two years earlier , " the edukators " became the first german movie in a long time to be chosen for the official competition at the cannes film festival . " the downfall , " " sophie scholl : the final days " and " the story of the weeping camel " all received oscar nomination , with caroline link actually taking home the trophy for " nowhere in africa . "
this year , " the lives of others " might follow suit . movies without make-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from christian petzold 's " ghosts " many young film directors are not interested in making major movies along the lines of hollywood blockbusters , but focus on authentic stories in their films .
they want to depict reality - without make-up , without knick-knack and without artificiality .
they 're saving on dialogue , gestures and wild cuts .
dramatic moments are often presented in a quiet and casual way .
it 's a strong characteristic that 's valued abroad . what 's decisive is that the films deal with universal subjects such as immigration , fear of social decline and nationalism , but also love and friendship that touch people around the world . not bigger than life film director matthias luthardt 's award-winning " pingpong , " for example , shows a seemingly happy family and the internal and external forces that weigh it down .
the film 's been successful with international audiences in cannes , prague and kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " eden , " charlotte roche presented a rather unusual , but not unrealistic way to eat berries and cream " stories about everyday life do well abroad , " he said .
" the films that have been produced in germany in the last couple of years are not bigger than life , but simply recount reality . " people simply want to identify with characters in movies , said michael hofmann , whose film " eden " about an eccentric chef was screened at the london festival . " people are basically not that different , " he said .
" there has to be something universal that connects us all .

they claim the cartoons are as offensive as holocaust denial . this week in the land of voltaire a civil court will debate where free speech and religious sensitivities overlap .
the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .
boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .

“ we support charlie hebdo in its commitment to free expression and to the right to satire and we condemn the many different kinds of intimidation that have been targeted at this weekly , ” the organisation said in it 's statement .

they claim the cartoons are as offensive as holocaust denial . this week in the land of voltaire a civil court will debate where free speech and religious sensitivities overlap .
the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .

the squad can draw on players from some of the biggest and best clubs in europe - olympique lyon and arsenal to name just two . 2008 may be switzerland 's best shot ever at a major title .
as co-hosts of the european championships , together with austria , they will have the considerable advantage of playing in front of home crowds . and because host countries automatically qualify for the tournament , switzerland can spend 2007 fine-tuning their squad without having to worry about getting results . that 's got their coach , jakob " köbi " kuhn , setting his sights high .

" germany is a strong opponent , " kuhn told the german soccer magazine kicker ahead of the two countries ' friendly .
" we 'll know more about where we stand after the match . " at the 2006 world cup , switzerland showed it can hold its own , progressing to the knock-out round of the tournament without conceding a goal . their main achilles ' heel was from the spot .
the swiss exited the world cup in a penalty shoot-out against ukraine - after failing to convert a single chance .
coincidentally that match also took place in dortmund . germany lose klose for clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose headed back to bremen for treatment miroslav klose will miss the friendly against switzerland as he has failed to recover from a thumb injury , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed wednesday . the absence of the werder bremen striker , who picked up the injury in sunday 's defeat to schalke 04 , and the suspended lukas podolski means that coach joachim löw is likely to start with schalke 's kevin kuranyi and vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke up front . klose fell on his thumb during training tuesday evening which resulted in swelling .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .
" but chairman oberstar is not willing to make that sacrifice of our domestic control over domestic airlines , " he stressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .
" but chairman oberstar is not willing to make that sacrifice of our domestic control over domestic airlines , " he stressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

therefore , germany should send anything required to combat this threat to europe and the nato states .
nato has depended for too long on the united states to do much of the dirty work in defense of europe .
it 's about time europe began to learn once again about the ugly business of defending itself from foreign threats .
europeans -lrb- including germans -rrb- believe that everything can be solved with diplomacy .

who can know better than the german themselves the effects of war and living a life under the clouds of arms and ammunitions ?
germans have helped the afghani people a lot by hosting a number of afghani refugees .
one clear sign of this help and generosity can be seen in two of the ministers in the present afghan government .
both lived in refuge in germany during the hard times of their life .
instead of sending more troops and spending more money on guns and bombs , it 's better to help by building new factories and production plants so as to engage the afghanis in normal life and enable them to live with dignity . - suhail kureishi compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves sending tornados to afghanistan the german cabinet has voted to send up to eight tornado jets to afghanistan for use in surveillance operations as nato-led forces battle a taliban insurgency .

in particular the food standards agency advice is that there is no risk in eating any sort of properly cooked poultry including turkey and eggs . " eu checks defenses it 's not yet known how the disease arrived in britain but veterinary experts investigating the infection suspect it was brought in by wild birds .

despite the swift british action to contain the virus , japan , russia , the ukraine , hong kong , south korea , south africa and jersey have all slapped import bans on british poultry , although consumers in britain appear to have remained calm , with poultry sales remaining stable . last year , the french were more fearful .

they claim the cartoons are as offensive as holocaust denial . this week in the land of voltaire a civil court will debate where free speech and religious sensitivities overlap .
the grand mosque of paris and the union of french islamic organisations are suing the satirical magazine charlie hebdo over their reprinting of the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammad which sparked violence in the muslim world last year . the weekly is also being sued for publishing a third drawing by french cartoonist cabu that showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " paris grand mosque rector dalil boubakeur said the controversial cartoon showing mohammad with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire , but an insult against all muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists .
boubakeur said last week he wanted to show that reprinting the cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-semitism or holocaust denial , which are both banned under french law . however boubakeur is facing an uphill battle .
courts in france , which observes a strict separation of church and state in the public sphere , have repeatedly defended free speech rights against religious objections .
the catholic church failed in recent years to win court injunctions against a film poster with a cross formed like a swastika and a fashion ad with scantily clad women posing like jesus and his apostles in da vinci 's painting the last supper . charlie has many friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartoons have triggered world-wide debate on freedom of speech politicians , intellectuals , secular muslims and left-wing pressure groups have also lined up behind the magazine , arguing that muslim groups have no right to call for limits on free speech . " i just can not imagine the consequences not only for france but for denmark and europe if they lose the case , " fleming rose , the danish editor who first published the cartoons , told a news conference with charlie hebdo publisher philippe val .
" it would turn back the clock decades , ages . " the organisation reporters without borders has also voiced unconditional support for charlie hebdo , in a statement released on tuesday .
“ we support charlie hebdo in its commitment to free expression and to the right to satire and we condemn the many different kinds of intimidation that have been targeted at this weekly , ” the organisation said in it 's statement .
“ the public area must remain open not only to dialogue but also to controversy . ” media rage in an act of solidarity with charlie hebdo , french newspaper liberation printed the contested cartoons once more on wednesday : " it is not words which wound , or pictures that kill .
it is bombs , " the daily said , calling the trial " idiotic " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moslems reacted violently to the original publication a televised debate between charlie hebdo publisher val and boubakeur broke down in acrimony on feb .
6 after they squabbled over the limits of free speech .
" if we ca n't criticise religion anymore , there will be no women 's rights , no birth control and no gay rights , " val said in the raucous tv debate . however it appears the general public may see things differently .
in a french opinion poll conducted on feb .
6 showed 79 percent thought it unacceptable to ridicule a religion publicly and 78 percent ruled out parodies of jesus christ , mohammad or buddha . legal confusion the paris court will hear the case on wednesday and thursday , and issue its ruling at a later date .
the plaintiffs are requesting 30,000 euros in damages and the publication of key passages from the court ’ s ruling .
the editors of jyllands-posten were acquitted in october 2006 of any wrongdoing in a separate case in a danish court and very few editors among the dozens of newspapers worldwide that re-printed the cartoons have faced legal action .
a russian editor of a small newspaper was fined 100,000 roubles -lrb- 3,000 euros -rrb- in april last year and convicted of inciting religious hatred for publishing one of the cartoons . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed continues to simmer as more muslim countries join the fray .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .

that 's down to what many consider a golden generation of players . ahead of their friendly with germany in dortmund on wednesday , the swiss had lots of reasons for optimism .
the squad can draw on players from some of the biggest and best clubs in europe - olympique lyon and arsenal to name just two . 2008 may be switzerland 's best shot ever at a major title .
as co-hosts of the european championships , together with austria , they will have the considerable advantage of playing in front of home crowds . and because host countries automatically qualify for the tournament , switzerland can spend 2007 fine-tuning their squad without having to worry about getting results . that 's got their coach , jakob " köbi " kuhn , setting his sights high .
" we 're playing to win in 2008 , " kuhn says - a statement that not too long ago would have sounded ridiculous for a nation whose sporting triumphs usually come on slopes of snow , not fields of grass . youthful success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philippe senderos is n't afraid of hard-nosed action striker tranquillo barnetta and philippe senderos know what it 's like to take home a trophy .
both were members of the swiss junior team that won the european under-17 championships in 2002 . kuhn is hoping that his golden generation , now its twenties , has matured enough to compete against europe 's bigger sides at the adult level .
" germany is a strong opponent , " kuhn told the german soccer magazine kicker ahead of the two countries ' friendly .
" we 'll know more about where we stand after the match . " at the 2006 world cup , switzerland showed it can hold its own , progressing to the knock-out round of the tournament without conceding a goal . their main achilles ' heel was from the spot .
the swiss exited the world cup in a penalty shoot-out against ukraine - after failing to convert a single chance .
coincidentally that match also took place in dortmund . germany lose klose for clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose headed back to bremen for treatment miroslav klose will miss the friendly against switzerland as he has failed to recover from a thumb injury , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed wednesday . the absence of the werder bremen striker , who picked up the injury in sunday 's defeat to schalke 04 , and the suspended lukas podolski means that coach joachim löw is likely to start with schalke 's kevin kuranyi and vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke up front . klose fell on his thumb during training tuesday evening which resulted in swelling .
the dfb medical team decided not to risk the player and he returned to bremen for treatment . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coach hoping for quick euro qualification for the first time in four years the german national side goes into the new year without the challenge of a major tournament to look forward to .

that 's down to what many consider a golden generation of players . ahead of their friendly with germany in dortmund on wednesday , the swiss had lots of reasons for optimism .
the squad can draw on players from some of the biggest and best clubs in europe - olympique lyon and arsenal to name just two . 2008 may be switzerland 's best shot ever at a major title .
as co-hosts of the european championships , together with austria , they will have the considerable advantage of playing in front of home crowds . and because host countries automatically qualify for the tournament , switzerland can spend 2007 fine-tuning their squad without having to worry about getting results . that 's got their coach , jakob " köbi " kuhn , setting his sights high .
" we 're playing to win in 2008 , " kuhn says - a statement that not too long ago would have sounded ridiculous for a nation whose sporting triumphs usually come on slopes of snow , not fields of grass . youthful success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philippe senderos is n't afraid of hard-nosed action striker tranquillo barnetta and philippe senderos know what it 's like to take home a trophy .
both were members of the swiss junior team that won the european under-17 championships in 2002 . kuhn is hoping that his golden generation , now its twenties , has matured enough to compete against europe 's bigger sides at the adult level .
" germany is a strong opponent , " kuhn told the german soccer magazine kicker ahead of the two countries ' friendly .
" we 'll know more about where we stand after the match . " at the 2006 world cup , switzerland showed it can hold its own , progressing to the knock-out round of the tournament without conceding a goal . their main achilles ' heel was from the spot .
the swiss exited the world cup in a penalty shoot-out against ukraine - after failing to convert a single chance .
coincidentally that match also took place in dortmund . germany lose klose for clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose headed back to bremen for treatment miroslav klose will miss the friendly against switzerland as he has failed to recover from a thumb injury , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed wednesday . the absence of the werder bremen striker , who picked up the injury in sunday 's defeat to schalke 04 , and the suspended lukas podolski means that coach joachim löw is likely to start with schalke 's kevin kuranyi and vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke up front . klose fell on his thumb during training tuesday evening which resulted in swelling .
the dfb medical team decided not to risk the player and he returned to bremen for treatment . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coach hoping for quick euro qualification for the first time in four years the german national side goes into the new year without the challenge of a major tournament to look forward to .

making cakes - and eating them too , of course - are a long-standing tradition and many german cake recipes are known around the world . when one of germany ’ s most well-known musicians and entertainers calls himself a " singing herrentorte , " you know that germans take their traditions seriously . and when you find out that the recipe for black forest cake is actually regulated by the state , you start to get the picture that baking is no laughing matter for germans . tastes and traditions from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black forest cake is a german specialty afternoon coffee and cake may be a german tradition , but the art of cake making dates back to the confectioners at the courts of the french kings .
the artistic preparation of fruit pastes originated in the arab countries and came to germany via italy .
according to old records , cakes have been baked in germany for over 400 years . there are countless different kinds of cakes and pastries in german patisseries and cafes - from the infamous black forest cake and other traditional cakes like herrentorte , baumkuchen , frankfurter kranz and dresdner christstollen , to the various different kinds of strudel and pastries adorned with fresh fruits . some confectioners and coffee houses may appear rather outdated and arguably over-elegant these days , but the granny image certainly has not rubbed off on the cakes themselves .
coffee and cake remains a tradition dear to german hearts and , despite the coffee-to-go trend , cake knives continue to be on the bestseller lists in house ware shops . if i 'd known you were coming … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't need a special occasion to make a cake perhaps this all has something to do with the fact that invitations to " coffee and cake " on a sunday afternoon are as widespread as they are beloved . ernie in the children ’ s program sesame street sings , " if i ’ d known you were coming , i would have baked you a cake . "
and baking someone a cake - whether it ’ s for a wedding , a birthday , or just because - is something that transcends generations and is a typically german gesture . and let ’ s not forget that germany not only played host to last year ’ s soccer world cup , it also organized the confectioners world cup as well . andrea rummel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : dresden fruitcake : germany 's secret weapon the " dresdner stollen , " a christmas treat made exclusively in the eastern german city , has its supporters around the world .

but both sides had said they remained committed to new dialogue . " the prize if we are successful is a historic agreement that will set the model for the rest of the world to follow , " barrot said in a statement . employment benefits on both sides of the atlantic the eu estimates that an agreement would generate more than 25 million extra passengers over the next five years , and create 80,000 new jobs in the eu and united states combined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot says there is no time to waste " time is not on our side .
now is not the time to delay or to shy away from hard decisions and hard choices , " barrot said at the two-day talks joined by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , representing the eu 's presidency . the meeting was also discussing an eu push to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft emissions , a controversial subject for a us administration that has refused to ratify the kyoto pact against global warming . eu : agreement must include environmental responsibilities barrot wants to include the aviation industry in the eu 's emissions trading scheme .
in a speech in brussels monday , he said the industry " has made excellent progress in minimizing the noise and emissions it produces . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any " open skies " deal should also be a " clean skies " deal " but we must ensure that aviation goes further to play its full and fair part in meeting the global environmental challenges we face , " the commissioner told the international aviation club of washington . on open skies , peters has said the decision to withdraw plans for a greater foreign role in the business operations of us airlines was taken after protests from the industry and from congress .
but peters has also stressed : " nobody doubts the benefits to travelers , airlines and our economy of making it easier to fly to and from europe . " in november 2005 , brussels and washington hammered out the outlines of a pact to allow freer competition by us and eu airlines , opening the prospect of cheaper tickets and more choice for passengers . as part of the deal , the us government offered to allow foreign investors a bigger role in the marketing , routing and fleet structures of us airlines . voting rights row proves a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain majority rights in its airlines but in a lingering sore point for the eu , the united states wanted to limit foreign voting rights in its airlines to 25 percent of the capital .
the eu has a higher ceiling of 49 percent . the two sides have been trying to forge a comprehensive agreement to replace a patchwork of bilateral deals secured by the us government with individual eu states .
those deals were ruled illegal by the eu 's top court . the us government backed down after an outcry from us airline unions and from some carriers , who saw no benefit from the eu deal to their key goal of winning more landing rights at london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest . and with the democrats now back in control of congress , political opposition is also hardening . james oberstar , the democratic chairman of the house of representatives transportation committee , has warned peters against surrendering to eu demands in the latest negotiations . oberstar " is all in favor of an open skies deal between the united states and the eu , " committee spokesman jim berard told afp .

the scheme was announced on jan .
22 by the eu immigration commissioner franco frattini . " it will be something flexible which will coordinate job offers and job hunters between mali and the eu , " frattini told the european parliament .
eu development commissioner louis michel will discuss the pilot project during a trip to mali 's capital bamako on feb .
8 . the project is aims at boosting the eu 's aging workforce and assist the economies of developing countries , by allowing their workers to develop skills and earn money - both of which it is hoped they will bring home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini advocates circular immigration however it 's also part of an eu strategy to combat illegal immigration .
in return for assistance with legal " circular immigration " frattini expects mali to boost its cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration to the eu and to sign a treaty with the eu on the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
nationals from mali , along with senegal , gambia and mauritania often make the perilous journey to europe illegally in rickety boats looking for better lives . the new guest workers mali has been chosen from the sub-saharan countries for the pilot because the former french colony already has a national employment agency and a history of bilateral migration agreements , including an accord with france . the scheme will cover farm labourers , construction workers and seasonal tourism employees and is modelled along the line of a project in spain 's southern huelva province , which receives 1,000 agricultural workers from morocco for six months each year . if successful , the eu will establish a network of job centres across africa .
before that can happen though , the eu commissioner will now need to find job quota offers from member states for mali workers .
" we do n't intend to impose workers on countries that do n't want them , " he told the parliament . swelling a greying population the eu has no common immigration policy and frattini has said that in october he would propose the creation of a new type of work permit for the most qualified applicants , such as engineers .
such a european " green card " would allow people to travel in several eu countries and not just one , as is the case with current visas .
he added that at the end of next month or in early april he would present an eu-wide plan for minimum penalties for illegal immigrants . the bloc has discussed creating a joint immigration policy for years but the effort has bogged down due to the complexity of aligning national rules and major disagreements between eu countries about how to deal with illegal immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands from africa attempt to reach europe every year the issue has gained political urgency amid a rising wave of arrivals in overcrowded boats of destitute africans to southern european nations , particularly spain and italy . old solution , new problem in the 1960s germany introduced a similar scheme for turkish ' guest workers ' who came to do the jobs no one wanted and became the unsung heroes of the post-war economic miracle .
however the scheme never became the ' circular migration ' that the german government envisaged , and tensions erupted when turkish migrants , many of whom were born and brought up in germany , demanded citizenship rights . german interior minister wolfgang schauble told reporters he backed the new scheme because if the countries in question were going to help stem the flow of illegal immigration " you have to give something in return " .
eu members france and spain have recently signed such accords with senegal , the jumping off point for many desperate immigrants heading for spain 's canary islands . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin and paris suggest new model for eu migration french and german interior ministers have proposed a new eu migration policy from the european union 's six largest countries .
the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time .

one photo in the no added sugar catalogue showed a young girl on all fours on a chest of drawers .

no added sugar said it did not see any sexual references and found the suggestion " shocking and upsetting " .
' serious offence ' the first picture , of the girl on the chest drawers , was likely to cause serious or widespread offence because she could be seen as being sexually provocative , the asa found .
a caption next to the picture said : " a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting , and a true lady should act like one . "
" we concluded that the image could be seen to be sexualising the child and the image was therefore irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence " asa a second photo showed a young girl lying on the back seat of a car .
" we concluded that the image could be seen to be sexualising the child and the image was therefore irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence , " the asa said .
a third picture , of a young boy wearing low-slung jeans and pushing a car , was similarly ruled as irresponsible because it could be seen as sexualising him .
the asa ordered the firm not to use the three images or anything similar to them again .
no added sugar said it had received only six complaints after 14,000 copies of its winter catalogue were sent out .

in a speech in rio de janeiro , president lula said it was time for wealthy countries to do more to reduce gas emissions .
he called on them to stop preaching on what to do with the amazon rainforest .
president lula said developed nations applied a double standard in their approach to global warming .
the brazilian president has accused wealthy countries of not doing enough on the environment before , but he has rarely been this direct .
he said they were skilful at drafting agreements and protocols , like the kyoto treaty , to appear as if they were doing something to reverse dangerous gas emissions .
in practice , however , he said the results proved otherwise .
' world leader ' president lula was most adamant on the issue of deforestation .
developed countries , he said , had nothing to teach brazil on the subject , adding that his country had reduced the deforestation of the amazon rainforest by more than 50 % in the last three years .
brazil says it has reduced amazon deforestation by 50 % this was something which should serve as a lesson to developed countries , which in his words , had already deforested everything under their control .
on the subject of alternative fuels , president lula described brazil as a world leader .
and indeed the south american country is the world 's largest producer of ethanol made from sugar cane and it has the world 's largest fleet of cars that run on alternative fuels .
the brazilian president said he would be leading an international campaign to highlight the need for wealthy countries to reduce gas emissions .
his comments come a day after the un secretary general ban ki-moon told a un conference on the environment that the world 's poor , who are the least responsible for global warming , will suffer the most from the effects of climate change .

brazil says it has reduced amazon deforestation by 50 % this was something which should serve as a lesson to developed countries , which in his words , had already deforested everything under their control .
on the subject of alternative fuels , president lula described brazil as a world leader .

the brazilian president said he would be leading an international campaign to highlight the need for wealthy countries to reduce gas emissions .

the government says local authorities will be able to bid for £ 5m for trial schemes to help muslim communities tackle the threat of extremism .
local groups are being asked to come up with ideas for projects such as anti-extremism forums .
communities secretary ruth kelly said the battle for hearts and minds could only be won at grassroots level .
the department for communities and local government has been charged with developing a strategy to tackle extremism after the government was criticised for not doing enough in the year after the july 2005 london bombings .
since then , ms kelly 's department has been holding talks with a broader range of muslim organisations and thinkers , having accepted it had previously relied too heavily on groups traditionally seen as community leaders .
one of the groups that has fallen out of favour is the muslim council of britain , the main umbrella body .
some of the new groups holding talks in whitehall have urged ministers to shift their focus from major government-initiated projects on extremism to grassroots action .
up to 50 local authorities are now being asked to work with muslim communities to come up with schemes that could be repeated nationwide .
' new partnership ' " we need a new , strengthened partnership and unity of purpose to isolate those who seek to divide us , " said ms kelly .
proposed schemes youth exclusion schemes to prevent grooming anti-extremism forums local leadership projects training for mosques school twinning volunteering projects " there are many people in muslim communities who are already taking a brave stand and doing incredible work .
it 's important we do more to support them specifically through local authorities and organisations who know their communities best . "
among the ideas being floated are schemes to target alienated young men who may be vulnerable to grooming by extremists because they do not attend local mosques , have jobs or go to college .
another proposal is a network of local anti-radicalisation forums which would be charged with countering extremist street politics and interpretations of holy texts .
the government also wants to see leadership projects for imams and muslim women alongside training and information for islamic institutions to help them spot the warning signs .
khurshid ahmed , chairman of the british muslim forum , based in the west midlands , said he welcomed the change in government tactics - but added that more needed to be done , particularly to support young muslims trying to run their own deradicalisation programmes .
" we welcome any initiative that puts resources into local communities to tackle the issues that we face .
" but we need a lot more money than this .
extremism is like a virus that needs a very strong dose of vaccine in order to be dealt with .
while £ 5m is a start , we could spend £ 5m in birmingham alone .
" we need a holistic approach and that means dealing with very serious problems in all communities such as alienated youth - be they white men influenced by the bnp or muslim youths influenced by ideological extremism . "

the department for communities and local government has been charged with developing a strategy to tackle extremism after the government was criticised for not doing enough in the year after the july 2005 london bombings .
since then , ms kelly 's department has been holding talks with a broader range of muslim organisations and thinkers , having accepted it had previously relied too heavily on groups traditionally seen as community leaders .
one of the groups that has fallen out of favour is the muslim council of britain , the main umbrella body .
some of the new groups holding talks in whitehall have urged ministers to shift their focus from major government-initiated projects on extremism to grassroots action .
up to 50 local authorities are now being asked to work with muslim communities to come up with schemes that could be repeated nationwide .
' new partnership ' " we need a new , strengthened partnership and unity of purpose to isolate those who seek to divide us , " said ms kelly .
proposed schemes youth exclusion schemes to prevent grooming anti-extremism forums local leadership projects training for mosques school twinning volunteering projects " there are many people in muslim communities who are already taking a brave stand and doing incredible work .
it 's important we do more to support them specifically through local authorities and organisations who know their communities best . "
among the ideas being floated are schemes to target alienated young men who may be vulnerable to grooming by extremists because they do not attend local mosques , have jobs or go to college .
another proposal is a network of local anti-radicalisation forums which would be charged with countering extremist street politics and interpretations of holy texts .
the government also wants to see leadership projects for imams and muslim women alongside training and information for islamic institutions to help them spot the warning signs .
khurshid ahmed , chairman of the british muslim forum , based in the west midlands , said he welcomed the change in government tactics - but added that more needed to be done , particularly to support young muslims trying to run their own deradicalisation programmes .
" we welcome any initiative that puts resources into local communities to tackle the issues that we face .
" but we need a lot more money than this .
extremism is like a virus that needs a very strong dose of vaccine in order to be dealt with .
while £ 5m is a start , we could spend £ 5m in birmingham alone .
" we need a holistic approach and that means dealing with very serious problems in all communities such as alienated youth - be they white men influenced by the bnp or muslim youths influenced by ideological extremism . "

the carrier said the duty was unfair as it did not apply to freight flights or recognise that some airlines have more efficient planes than others .
easyjet says its flights are 27 % more fuel efficient per passenger than the european airline average .
the airline saw passenger numbers for the last three months of 2006 rise 10 % .
it also predicted that its profits for year to december were set to rise by 40-50 % , despite the carrier facing a 7 % rise in its fuel bill for the first half of its financial year .
new planes rules doubling the amount of passenger duty people pay when taking flights from the uk came into force last week .
uk air passenger duty now starts at £ 10 for an economy class flight within the uk or europe , rising to £ 80 for a business or first class ticket on a long-haul flight .
however , easyjet said that by investing in newer planes it had been able to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 18 % per passenger since 2000 .

the carrier said the duty was unfair as it did not apply to freight flights or recognise that some airlines have more efficient planes than others .
easyjet says its flights are 27 % more fuel efficient per passenger than the european airline average .
the airline saw passenger numbers for the last three months of 2006 rise 10 % .
it also predicted that its profits for year to december were set to rise by 40-50 % , despite the carrier facing a 7 % rise in its fuel bill for the first half of its financial year .
new planes rules doubling the amount of passenger duty people pay when taking flights from the uk came into force last week .
uk air passenger duty now starts at £ 10 for an economy class flight within the uk or europe , rising to £ 80 for a business or first class ticket on a long-haul flight .
however , easyjet said that by investing in newer planes it had been able to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 18 % per passenger since 2000 .

greenwich council in south-east london has told mayor ken livingstone that something needs to be done about congestion in the town centre .
the mayor said no scheme would proceed unless it was backed by local people .
a transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- spokesman said it would be a " one-off " measure and not an expansion of the current congestion charge zone .
he said the group was working with greenwich council to " explore the feasibility of a range of options to cut traffic growth and deter unnecessary journeys into the borough " .
we do n't want to do it unless people want it locally london mayor ken livingstone he said traffic surveys must be completed before tfl would be in a position to know what the options were for greenwich .
mr livingstone said : " greenwich council came to me months ago and said the traffic around greenwich town centre was a nightmare , and could we look at it . "
he said a decision could be made by the end of spring , but added : " we do n't want to do it unless people want it locally . "
increase emissions he said residents were being asked about their travel patterns and if the scheme looked viable , a wider consultation would be launched .
but john mcgoldrick of the national alliance against tolls said this was not the answer .
he said : " more so-called congestion charges will just shunt the traffic round , increase vehicle emissions and harm local businesses .
" money should be sent on improvements to roads and public transport , not on collecting toll taxes . "

the display at the victoria and albert museum shows her continually changing image from 1987 onwards .
it features the dungarees she wore as charlene in the australian soap neighbours and the gold hot pants she wore in her spinning around video .
minogue , 38 , was cheered by fans as she arrived for a private viewing and said she was " honoured " by the exhibition .
" i was actually speechless .
it was a very strange feeling .
i was so honoured and overwhelmed , " she told reporters after seeing the display for the first time .
the singer , who has recently split from actor boyfriend olivier martinez , said her " friend " had wished her " all the best " .
asked how she was feeling , she said : " i 'm here tonight , it 's all good . "
inside the museum , she gave a short speech saying : " i ca n't believe there are disco balls and glitter at the v & a - but i , for one , think it looks fabulous . "
iconic costumes the museum has had 3,500 advance bookings for the free show and set up an advance booking system because of its popularity .
the exhibition is made up of over 200 items of minogue memorabilia , which the star herself had previously donated to the arts centre in melbourne .
black headless mannequins display some of the most iconic costumes the star has worn throughout the her 20 year career .
they range from the simple white dress she wore in the 1987 video for i should be so lucky to the hooded all-in-one suit she wore in the 2001 video for ca n't get you out of my head .
a collection of costumes from her recent showgirl : homecoming tour , delayed owing to the star being diagnosed with breast cancer , are also featured .
the museum 's curator , vicky broackes , said she wanted to show how minogue 's wardrobe was not " just fashion - it 's a working wardrobe " .
" her tour costumes have to be robust .
they are washed up to 60 times and she has two of every outfit , " she said .
the exhibition opens to the public on thursday and runs until 10 june .

american tycoons george gillett and tom hicks agreed to make funds available to build the new stadium in stanley park as part of the deal .
the £ 215m project is expected to bring new community facilities , jobs , homes and business to anfield and breckfield .
council leader warren bradley said it was " fantastic news " for the area .
2009 opening " for too long the area has been in decline and i am hopeful that it is now full steam ahead for this amazing project which will give local people a much better life , " said mr bradley .
" the club will get a brand new state-of-the-art stadium , stanley park will be restored to its former glory with new community facilities and the area will be completely regenerated with new homes and businesses . "
mr bradley said he looked forward to meeting with the new owners to share the council 's hopes and aspirations for the area .
under the current proposals , the existing stadium will be redeveloped to become anfield plaza - a mix of shops , offices , homes , a hotel , and a new public open space .
