but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .
" i do n't think we should be waiting until 2015 .

but experts say the mild winter might prevent it spreading . european health commissioner markos kyprianou urged all member states " to step up their vigilance " and to reassess their risk levels following the outbreak at a goose farm in csongrad county , southeastern hungary , according to his spokesman philip tod . an eu-approved laboratory in britain had confirmed that it " was indeed a case of the h5n1 strain , " tod told a press conference in brussels . meanwhile , the hungarian authorities announced a suspected second outbreak in the southeast of the country and said they had responded by slaughtering all 9,400 geese on the farm . " animals suspected of carrying bird flu were found friday on a goose farm in derekegyhaza , " about 170 kilometers -lrb- 105 miles -rrb- southeast of budapest , the agriculture ministry said . samples from that farm were also sent to the laboratory in weybridge , near london , which the commission uses to confirm such cases . tod stressed that in both instances all eu rules had been carried out , including the slaughter of infected flocks , disinfection of affected farms and the setting up of safety zones within a 10-kilometer perimeter . while assuring that no further measures were necessary , tod said fresh outbreaks could not be ruled out . neighbors ban hungarian poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is alarmed by the recurrence of the virus but nearby non-eu countries have taken their own measures , with croatia , serbia and russia banning hungarian poultry exports . meanwhile , new eu member bulgaria responded to the outbreak by banning outdoor poultry markets and putting in place tighter control mechanisms , including border checks , to protect against the spread of bird flu , the agriculture ministry said in a statement . four cases of h5n1 were registered in bulgaria last february in wild swans in the north of the country , but there have been no cases recorded in poultry there . first european recurrence it is the first incidence in the european union of the highly pathogenic avian influenza since august 2006 , when one case occurred in a zoo in dresden , germany .
the virus has killed about 160 people worldwide since late 2003 . the origin of the hungarian outbreak is still being investigated , but wild birds are considered " a strong possibility " by the european commission . between late 2005 and mid-2006 , 13 eu nations - plus romania , which has since become a member - uncovered cases of the h5n1 strain . jean-luc angot , deputy director-general of the world organization for animal health , said in paris on monday that the virus found this month in hungary was " 99.4 percent identical " to the strain that caused outbreaks across europe last year . the extremely close similarity suggests the virus holed up among birds in hungary , enabling it to survive after the end of the outbreak last spring , he said . the weather factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year earlier this month the eu decided to lift its ban on live birds entering the bloc but laid down strict conditions for their import . eu food chain and veterinary experts decided to replace the ban with strict new guidelines that go beyond the rules that were in place before the embargo was imposed in october 2005 amid an earlier bird flu scare . experts have suggested that the exceptionally mild winter might prevent the virus spreading .
last year , the biting cold meant animals herded together , which would facilitate contamination , at a time when animals might also well be weakened by lack of nutrition . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa development aid -pipe- 30.01.2007 development aid promises often go unfulfilled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a billion people subsist on less than a dollar a day in 2000 , g8 nations , including germany , pledged to devote more money to combat misery in the world 's poorest countries .
but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .
" i do n't think we should be waiting until 2015 .

the model is ireland , where a public ban on smoking has been seen as a great success . following the release of a discussion paper on smoking released on tuesday , the eu executive said overall health in the entire eu would benefit if a wide-ranging smoking ban were put in place in all 27 members states . " the commission considers that the policy of the widest possible scope would bring the biggest benefit to public health , " the eu paper said .
" several successful examples of comprehensive smoke-free policy now in force around the world proved that this option is viable and enforceable . " according to eu health commissioner markos kyprianou , the intention of the report is " to explore both legal mechanisms and health promotion initiatives at both european and member-state level . " the commission , however , stopped short of saying whether or not it would introduce an eu-wide ban , although it did not rule out such a move . differing laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans in several eu countries have driven smokers outdoors currently europe has a patchwork of national laws prohibiting smoking .
ireland introduced a comprehensive ban , prohibiting smoking in pubs , restaurants and other enclosed workplaces , in 2004 .
italy , sweden and scotland have introduced similar legislation , allowing smoking only in closed-off , separately ventilated areas , with britain expected to follow suit . other nations , including belgium , cyprus , lithuania , spain , slovenia and the netherlands have smoking bans with various exceptions while most eu member states have bans or restrictions in major public buildings . france will introduce a ban this week on smoking in the workplace and as of next year , bars restaurants and cafes will have to comply . other countries , such as belgium and germany , oppose a ban or favor limited legislation . in germany , however , a proposed smoking ban collapsed due to concerns it would violate the country 's constitution and has struggled to introduce even modest restrictions .
lawmakers are discussing ways to implement a more wide-ranging ban , but there are as yet no concrete plans for one . noisome fumes the commission cited figures showing that adults who are in daily contact with a smoker increase their mortality rate by 15 percent , even if they have never smoked .
eu figures say that 19,000 non-smokers die from passive smoking each year in the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of europeans die every year from passive smoking , the eu says " the goal of the green paper is to promote debate on the issue and to seek views from government , meps and other interested parties on what role if any the eu could play , " said the spokesman for the eu health commissioner , philip tod last week . all 27 eu governments , along with non-governmental organizations , consumers and the tobacco industry have been invited to put forward proposals on smoking bans by may 31 .
the commission is expected to deliver its final recommendations in early 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet agrees on watered-down smoking ban after abandoning plans last week for a nationwide smoking ban in public places , the german cabinet has agreed to outlaw smoking in federal government buildings and on national public transport .

but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .

in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .

berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president .

" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .

in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.01.2007 nike makes bid for german national team sponsorship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas logos on their shirts might say nike in the future us sporting goods giant nike has offered 500 million euros -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- to be the sponsor of germany 's national soccer team .
it would be a blow to current sponsor adidas , germany 's partner for over five decades . nike could score a substantial win if it achieves its goal of knocking german company adidas off its perch on its home turf by winning the contract to sponsor the german national soccer team .
adidas has had the contract with the dfb german football association since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 . the portland , oregon-based company offered a 500 million euro -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- , eight-year sponsorship contract to the dfb , according to association president theo zwanziger , an amount which is six times more than adidas ' current contract . he told reporters that the dfb has been in a dispute with adidas over the duration of the current contract .
adidas had assumed the contract extended until 2014 although the soccer association assumed it would end in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provided the national jersey for the world cup " we 're in a difficult situation , " said zwanziger saying that the two sides have reached no final agreement .
adidas pays around 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- a year in its current sponsorship deal . while analysts say losing the germany team sponsorship deal would be a commercial blow to adidas , it would also bring an end to a long tradition and perhaps dent national pride .
adidas , based in the small bavarian town of herzogenaurach , has partnered with germany 's national team since the country 's victory in the world cup in 1954 . there could also be accusations of treachery since adidas founder adi dassler helped germany win its 1954 title with his screw-in studs , revolutionary for the time . money trumps patriotism but in today 's world of globalized , media-driven sports , national concerns figure less than they might have in the past and sporting goods giants are aggressively vying for high visibility sponsorships since they raise brand awareness and help boost bottom lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be a blow to adidas ' hometown of herzogenaurach if they lost the sponsorship contract franz beckenbauer , one of german soccer 's most influential figures and member of the world soccer association 's executive committee , has said that the dfb would be " liable to persecution " if it out and out rejected such an offer from nike . nike already has a contract with brazil , which has taken home the world championship trophy five times .
puma outfits 2006 champions italy .
that leaves adidas with major teams like argentina , france and , for now , germany . adidas shares on the benchmark dax index have suffered recently , losing almost three percent since the beginning of the year .

but experts say the mild winter might prevent it spreading . european health commissioner markos kyprianou urged all member states " to step up their vigilance " and to reassess their risk levels following the outbreak at a goose farm in csongrad county , southeastern hungary , according to his spokesman philip tod . an eu-approved laboratory in britain had confirmed that it " was indeed a case of the h5n1 strain , " tod told a press conference in brussels . meanwhile , the hungarian authorities announced a suspected second outbreak in the southeast of the country and said they had responded by slaughtering all 9,400 geese on the farm . " animals suspected of carrying bird flu were found friday on a goose farm in derekegyhaza , " about 170 kilometers -lrb- 105 miles -rrb- southeast of budapest , the agriculture ministry said . samples from that farm were also sent to the laboratory in weybridge , near london , which the commission uses to confirm such cases . tod stressed that in both instances all eu rules had been carried out , including the slaughter of infected flocks , disinfection of affected farms and the setting up of safety zones within a 10-kilometer perimeter . while assuring that no further measures were necessary , tod said fresh outbreaks could not be ruled out . neighbors ban hungarian poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is alarmed by the recurrence of the virus but nearby non-eu countries have taken their own measures , with croatia , serbia and russia banning hungarian poultry exports . meanwhile , new eu member bulgaria responded to the outbreak by banning outdoor poultry markets and putting in place tighter control mechanisms , including border checks , to protect against the spread of bird flu , the agriculture ministry said in a statement . four cases of h5n1 were registered in bulgaria last february in wild swans in the north of the country , but there have been no cases recorded in poultry there . first european recurrence it is the first incidence in the european union of the highly pathogenic avian influenza since august 2006 , when one case occurred in a zoo in dresden , germany .
the virus has killed about 160 people worldwide since late 2003 . the origin of the hungarian outbreak is still being investigated , but wild birds are considered " a strong possibility " by the european commission . between late 2005 and mid-2006 , 13 eu nations - plus romania , which has since become a member - uncovered cases of the h5n1 strain . jean-luc angot , deputy director-general of the world organization for animal health , said in paris on monday that the virus found this month in hungary was " 99.4 percent identical " to the strain that caused outbreaks across europe last year . the extremely close similarity suggests the virus holed up among birds in hungary , enabling it to survive after the end of the outbreak last spring , he said . the weather factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year earlier this month the eu decided to lift its ban on live birds entering the bloc but laid down strict conditions for their import . eu food chain and veterinary experts decided to replace the ban with strict new guidelines that go beyond the rules that were in place before the embargo was imposed in october 2005 amid an earlier bird flu scare . experts have suggested that the exceptionally mild winter might prevent the virus spreading .

the model is ireland , where a public ban on smoking has been seen as a great success . following the release of a discussion paper on smoking released on tuesday , the eu executive said overall health in the entire eu would benefit if a wide-ranging smoking ban were put in place in all 27 members states . " the commission considers that the policy of the widest possible scope would bring the biggest benefit to public health , " the eu paper said .
" several successful examples of comprehensive smoke-free policy now in force around the world proved that this option is viable and enforceable . " according to eu health commissioner markos kyprianou , the intention of the report is " to explore both legal mechanisms and health promotion initiatives at both european and member-state level . " the commission , however , stopped short of saying whether or not it would introduce an eu-wide ban , although it did not rule out such a move . differing laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans in several eu countries have driven smokers outdoors currently europe has a patchwork of national laws prohibiting smoking .
ireland introduced a comprehensive ban , prohibiting smoking in pubs , restaurants and other enclosed workplaces , in 2004 .
italy , sweden and scotland have introduced similar legislation , allowing smoking only in closed-off , separately ventilated areas , with britain expected to follow suit . other nations , including belgium , cyprus , lithuania , spain , slovenia and the netherlands have smoking bans with various exceptions while most eu member states have bans or restrictions in major public buildings . france will introduce a ban this week on smoking in the workplace and as of next year , bars restaurants and cafes will have to comply . other countries , such as belgium and germany , oppose a ban or favor limited legislation . in germany , however , a proposed smoking ban collapsed due to concerns it would violate the country 's constitution and has struggled to introduce even modest restrictions .
lawmakers are discussing ways to implement a more wide-ranging ban , but there are as yet no concrete plans for one . noisome fumes the commission cited figures showing that adults who are in daily contact with a smoker increase their mortality rate by 15 percent , even if they have never smoked .
eu figures say that 19,000 non-smokers die from passive smoking each year in the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of europeans die every year from passive smoking , the eu says " the goal of the green paper is to promote debate on the issue and to seek views from government , meps and other interested parties on what role if any the eu could play , " said the spokesman for the eu health commissioner , philip tod last week . all 27 eu governments , along with non-governmental organizations , consumers and the tobacco industry have been invited to put forward proposals on smoking bans by may 31 .
the commission is expected to deliver its final recommendations in early 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet agrees on watered-down smoking ban after abandoning plans last week for a nationwide smoking ban in public places , the german cabinet has agreed to outlaw smoking in federal government buildings and on national public transport .

but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa development aid -pipe- 30.01.2007 development aid promises often go unfulfilled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a billion people subsist on less than a dollar a day in 2000 , g8 nations , including germany , pledged to devote more money to combat misery in the world 's poorest countries .
but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .
" i do n't think we should be waiting until 2015 .
if the norwegians can do it today , the g8 can do it today .

but experts say the mild winter might prevent it spreading . european health commissioner markos kyprianou urged all member states " to step up their vigilance " and to reassess their risk levels following the outbreak at a goose farm in csongrad county , southeastern hungary , according to his spokesman philip tod . an eu-approved laboratory in britain had confirmed that it " was indeed a case of the h5n1 strain , " tod told a press conference in brussels . meanwhile , the hungarian authorities announced a suspected second outbreak in the southeast of the country and said they had responded by slaughtering all 9,400 geese on the farm . " animals suspected of carrying bird flu were found friday on a goose farm in derekegyhaza , " about 170 kilometers -lrb- 105 miles -rrb- southeast of budapest , the agriculture ministry said . samples from that farm were also sent to the laboratory in weybridge , near london , which the commission uses to confirm such cases . tod stressed that in both instances all eu rules had been carried out , including the slaughter of infected flocks , disinfection of affected farms and the setting up of safety zones within a 10-kilometer perimeter . while assuring that no further measures were necessary , tod said fresh outbreaks could not be ruled out . neighbors ban hungarian poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is alarmed by the recurrence of the virus but nearby non-eu countries have taken their own measures , with croatia , serbia and russia banning hungarian poultry exports . meanwhile , new eu member bulgaria responded to the outbreak by banning outdoor poultry markets and putting in place tighter control mechanisms , including border checks , to protect against the spread of bird flu , the agriculture ministry said in a statement . four cases of h5n1 were registered in bulgaria last february in wild swans in the north of the country , but there have been no cases recorded in poultry there . first european recurrence it is the first incidence in the european union of the highly pathogenic avian influenza since august 2006 , when one case occurred in a zoo in dresden , germany .
the virus has killed about 160 people worldwide since late 2003 . the origin of the hungarian outbreak is still being investigated , but wild birds are considered " a strong possibility " by the european commission . between late 2005 and mid-2006 , 13 eu nations - plus romania , which has since become a member - uncovered cases of the h5n1 strain . jean-luc angot , deputy director-general of the world organization for animal health , said in paris on monday that the virus found this month in hungary was " 99.4 percent identical " to the strain that caused outbreaks across europe last year . the extremely close similarity suggests the virus holed up among birds in hungary , enabling it to survive after the end of the outbreak last spring , he said . the weather factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year earlier this month the eu decided to lift its ban on live birds entering the bloc but laid down strict conditions for their import . eu food chain and veterinary experts decided to replace the ban with strict new guidelines that go beyond the rules that were in place before the embargo was imposed in october 2005 amid an earlier bird flu scare . experts have suggested that the exceptionally mild winter might prevent the virus spreading .

but experts say the mild winter might prevent it spreading . european health commissioner markos kyprianou urged all member states " to step up their vigilance " and to reassess their risk levels following the outbreak at a goose farm in csongrad county , southeastern hungary , according to his spokesman philip tod . an eu-approved laboratory in britain had confirmed that it " was indeed a case of the h5n1 strain , " tod told a press conference in brussels . meanwhile , the hungarian authorities announced a suspected second outbreak in the southeast of the country and said they had responded by slaughtering all 9,400 geese on the farm . " animals suspected of carrying bird flu were found friday on a goose farm in derekegyhaza , " about 170 kilometers -lrb- 105 miles -rrb- southeast of budapest , the agriculture ministry said . samples from that farm were also sent to the laboratory in weybridge , near london , which the commission uses to confirm such cases . tod stressed that in both instances all eu rules had been carried out , including the slaughter of infected flocks , disinfection of affected farms and the setting up of safety zones within a 10-kilometer perimeter . while assuring that no further measures were necessary , tod said fresh outbreaks could not be ruled out . neighbors ban hungarian poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is alarmed by the recurrence of the virus but nearby non-eu countries have taken their own measures , with croatia , serbia and russia banning hungarian poultry exports . meanwhile , new eu member bulgaria responded to the outbreak by banning outdoor poultry markets and putting in place tighter control mechanisms , including border checks , to protect against the spread of bird flu , the agriculture ministry said in a statement . four cases of h5n1 were registered in bulgaria last february in wild swans in the north of the country , but there have been no cases recorded in poultry there . first european recurrence it is the first incidence in the european union of the highly pathogenic avian influenza since august 2006 , when one case occurred in a zoo in dresden , germany .
the virus has killed about 160 people worldwide since late 2003 . the origin of the hungarian outbreak is still being investigated , but wild birds are considered " a strong possibility " by the european commission . between late 2005 and mid-2006 , 13 eu nations - plus romania , which has since become a member - uncovered cases of the h5n1 strain . jean-luc angot , deputy director-general of the world organization for animal health , said in paris on monday that the virus found this month in hungary was " 99.4 percent identical " to the strain that caused outbreaks across europe last year . the extremely close similarity suggests the virus holed up among birds in hungary , enabling it to survive after the end of the outbreak last spring , he said . the weather factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year earlier this month the eu decided to lift its ban on live birds entering the bloc but laid down strict conditions for their import . eu food chain and veterinary experts decided to replace the ban with strict new guidelines that go beyond the rules that were in place before the embargo was imposed in october 2005 amid an earlier bird flu scare . experts have suggested that the exceptionally mild winter might prevent the virus spreading .
last year , the biting cold meant animals herded together , which would facilitate contamination , at a time when animals might also well be weakened by lack of nutrition . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

it would be a blow to current sponsor adidas , germany 's partner for over five decades . nike could score a substantial win if it achieves its goal of knocking german company adidas off its perch on its home turf by winning the contract to sponsor the german national soccer team .
adidas has had the contract with the dfb german football association since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 . the portland , oregon-based company offered a 500 million euro -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- , eight-year sponsorship contract to the dfb , according to association president theo zwanziger , an amount which is six times more than adidas ' current contract . he told reporters that the dfb has been in a dispute with adidas over the duration of the current contract .
adidas had assumed the contract extended until 2014 although the soccer association assumed it would end in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provided the national jersey for the world cup " we 're in a difficult situation , " said zwanziger saying that the two sides have reached no final agreement .
adidas pays around 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- a year in its current sponsorship deal . while analysts say losing the germany team sponsorship deal would be a commercial blow to adidas , it would also bring an end to a long tradition and perhaps dent national pride .
adidas , based in the small bavarian town of herzogenaurach , has partnered with germany 's national team since the country 's victory in the world cup in 1954 . there could also be accusations of treachery since adidas founder adi dassler helped germany win its 1954 title with his screw-in studs , revolutionary for the time . money trumps patriotism but in today 's world of globalized , media-driven sports , national concerns figure less than they might have in the past and sporting goods giants are aggressively vying for high visibility sponsorships since they raise brand awareness and help boost bottom lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be a blow to adidas ' hometown of herzogenaurach if they lost the sponsorship contract franz beckenbauer , one of german soccer 's most influential figures and member of the world soccer association 's executive committee , has said that the dfb would be " liable to persecution " if it out and out rejected such an offer from nike . nike already has a contract with brazil , which has taken home the world championship trophy five times .

but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .
" i do n't think we should be waiting until 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa development aid -pipe- 30.01.2007 development aid promises often go unfulfilled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a billion people subsist on less than a dollar a day in 2000 , g8 nations , including germany , pledged to devote more money to combat misery in the world 's poorest countries .
but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment .

but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president .

" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .
" i do n't think we should be waiting until 2015 .
if the norwegians can do it today , the g8 can do it today .

" nato can create an environment where reconstruction is possible , but it can not completely answer all afghanistan 's open questions , " de hoop scheffer added . efforts to aid in afghan reconstruction are scheduled to be the subject of a two-day international conference beginning tuesday in berlin . the eu was the world 's most powerful civilian body and nato the most powerful military alliance , yet there was much doubling up of effort and a lack of cooperation between them , de hoop scheffer said . chief eu diplomat , javier solana , told the same conference that most eu nations did not spend enough on defense and would miss joint targets for 2010 .

the model is ireland , where a public ban on smoking has been seen as a great success . following the release of a discussion paper on smoking released on tuesday , the eu executive said overall health in the entire eu would benefit if a wide-ranging smoking ban were put in place in all 27 members states . " the commission considers that the policy of the widest possible scope would bring the biggest benefit to public health , " the eu paper said .
" several successful examples of comprehensive smoke-free policy now in force around the world proved that this option is viable and enforceable . " according to eu health commissioner markos kyprianou , the intention of the report is " to explore both legal mechanisms and health promotion initiatives at both european and member-state level . " the commission , however , stopped short of saying whether or not it would introduce an eu-wide ban , although it did not rule out such a move . differing laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans in several eu countries have driven smokers outdoors currently europe has a patchwork of national laws prohibiting smoking .
ireland introduced a comprehensive ban , prohibiting smoking in pubs , restaurants and other enclosed workplaces , in 2004 .
italy , sweden and scotland have introduced similar legislation , allowing smoking only in closed-off , separately ventilated areas , with britain expected to follow suit . other nations , including belgium , cyprus , lithuania , spain , slovenia and the netherlands have smoking bans with various exceptions while most eu member states have bans or restrictions in major public buildings . france will introduce a ban this week on smoking in the workplace and as of next year , bars restaurants and cafes will have to comply . other countries , such as belgium and germany , oppose a ban or favor limited legislation . in germany , however , a proposed smoking ban collapsed due to concerns it would violate the country 's constitution and has struggled to introduce even modest restrictions .
lawmakers are discussing ways to implement a more wide-ranging ban , but there are as yet no concrete plans for one . noisome fumes the commission cited figures showing that adults who are in daily contact with a smoker increase their mortality rate by 15 percent , even if they have never smoked .
eu figures say that 19,000 non-smokers die from passive smoking each year in the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of europeans die every year from passive smoking , the eu says " the goal of the green paper is to promote debate on the issue and to seek views from government , meps and other interested parties on what role if any the eu could play , " said the spokesman for the eu health commissioner , philip tod last week . all 27 eu governments , along with non-governmental organizations , consumers and the tobacco industry have been invited to put forward proposals on smoking bans by may 31 .

the model is ireland , where a public ban on smoking has been seen as a great success . following the release of a discussion paper on smoking released on tuesday , the eu executive said overall health in the entire eu would benefit if a wide-ranging smoking ban were put in place in all 27 members states . " the commission considers that the policy of the widest possible scope would bring the biggest benefit to public health , " the eu paper said .
" several successful examples of comprehensive smoke-free policy now in force around the world proved that this option is viable and enforceable . " according to eu health commissioner markos kyprianou , the intention of the report is " to explore both legal mechanisms and health promotion initiatives at both european and member-state level . " the commission , however , stopped short of saying whether or not it would introduce an eu-wide ban , although it did not rule out such a move . differing laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans in several eu countries have driven smokers outdoors currently europe has a patchwork of national laws prohibiting smoking .
ireland introduced a comprehensive ban , prohibiting smoking in pubs , restaurants and other enclosed workplaces , in 2004 .
italy , sweden and scotland have introduced similar legislation , allowing smoking only in closed-off , separately ventilated areas , with britain expected to follow suit . other nations , including belgium , cyprus , lithuania , spain , slovenia and the netherlands have smoking bans with various exceptions while most eu member states have bans or restrictions in major public buildings . france will introduce a ban this week on smoking in the workplace and as of next year , bars restaurants and cafes will have to comply . other countries , such as belgium and germany , oppose a ban or favor limited legislation . in germany , however , a proposed smoking ban collapsed due to concerns it would violate the country 's constitution and has struggled to introduce even modest restrictions .
lawmakers are discussing ways to implement a more wide-ranging ban , but there are as yet no concrete plans for one . noisome fumes the commission cited figures showing that adults who are in daily contact with a smoker increase their mortality rate by 15 percent , even if they have never smoked .
eu figures say that 19,000 non-smokers die from passive smoking each year in the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of europeans die every year from passive smoking , the eu says " the goal of the green paper is to promote debate on the issue and to seek views from government , meps and other interested parties on what role if any the eu could play , " said the spokesman for the eu health commissioner , philip tod last week . all 27 eu governments , along with non-governmental organizations , consumers and the tobacco industry have been invited to put forward proposals on smoking bans by may 31 .
the commission is expected to deliver its final recommendations in early 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet agrees on watered-down smoking ban after abandoning plans last week for a nationwide smoking ban in public places , the german cabinet has agreed to outlaw smoking in federal government buildings and on national public transport .

but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .

but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .

berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .

" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .

the model is ireland , where a public ban on smoking has been seen as a great success . following the release of a discussion paper on smoking released on tuesday , the eu executive said overall health in the entire eu would benefit if a wide-ranging smoking ban were put in place in all 27 members states . " the commission considers that the policy of the widest possible scope would bring the biggest benefit to public health , " the eu paper said .
" several successful examples of comprehensive smoke-free policy now in force around the world proved that this option is viable and enforceable . " according to eu health commissioner markos kyprianou , the intention of the report is " to explore both legal mechanisms and health promotion initiatives at both european and member-state level . " the commission , however , stopped short of saying whether or not it would introduce an eu-wide ban , although it did not rule out such a move . differing laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans in several eu countries have driven smokers outdoors currently europe has a patchwork of national laws prohibiting smoking .
ireland introduced a comprehensive ban , prohibiting smoking in pubs , restaurants and other enclosed workplaces , in 2004 .
italy , sweden and scotland have introduced similar legislation , allowing smoking only in closed-off , separately ventilated areas , with britain expected to follow suit . other nations , including belgium , cyprus , lithuania , spain , slovenia and the netherlands have smoking bans with various exceptions while most eu member states have bans or restrictions in major public buildings . france will introduce a ban this week on smoking in the workplace and as of next year , bars restaurants and cafes will have to comply . other countries , such as belgium and germany , oppose a ban or favor limited legislation . in germany , however , a proposed smoking ban collapsed due to concerns it would violate the country 's constitution and has struggled to introduce even modest restrictions .
lawmakers are discussing ways to implement a more wide-ranging ban , but there are as yet no concrete plans for one . noisome fumes the commission cited figures showing that adults who are in daily contact with a smoker increase their mortality rate by 15 percent , even if they have never smoked .
eu figures say that 19,000 non-smokers die from passive smoking each year in the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of europeans die every year from passive smoking , the eu says " the goal of the green paper is to promote debate on the issue and to seek views from government , meps and other interested parties on what role if any the eu could play , " said the spokesman for the eu health commissioner , philip tod last week . all 27 eu governments , along with non-governmental organizations , consumers and the tobacco industry have been invited to put forward proposals on smoking bans by may 31 .
the commission is expected to deliver its final recommendations in early 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet agrees on watered-down smoking ban after abandoning plans last week for a nationwide smoking ban in public places , the german cabinet has agreed to outlaw smoking in federal government buildings and on national public transport .

but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa development aid -pipe- 30.01.2007 development aid promises often go unfulfilled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a billion people subsist on less than a dollar a day in 2000 , g8 nations , including germany , pledged to devote more money to combat misery in the world 's poorest countries .
but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets . nearly one-sixth of the world 's population exists in extreme poverty - defined by the united nations as having less than one dollar a day to live on - and the divide between the poor southern hemisphere and the wealthy north is becoming ever wider .
in september 2000 , the united nations laid out seven goals it wanted to achieve in the new millennium .
they included the eradication of extreme poverty , the reduction of child mortality and improving the health of mothers . the world 's leading industrial nations promised that they would increase spending on developmental aid to 0.7 percent of their gross domestic products by the year 2015 .
but there are few signs that they are on their way toward fulfilling that promise . in germany , for example , achieving that target would mean doubling the amount the country currently spends on developmental aid . aid decline after the cold war " i ca n't really see it happening at the moment , " said markus löwe of the german development institute in bonn . expenditures have risen in the past few years , but that is primarily the result of debt-forgiveness programs .
and the long-term picture is different .
in the mid-1980s , public development aid in germany stood at 0.5 percent of gdp .
by 1998 that figure had fallen to 0.26 percent .
this was due largely to the end of the cold war , when germany 's shifting priorities led to a decline in development aid . norway , sweden and the netherlands have all met the 0.7 percent target .
in comparison , germany is lagging far behind . " healthy skepticism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey d. sachs hopes donors will meet their targets nonetheless , jeffrey d. sachs , the american economist who is the director of the united nations millennium project , says he 's confident that germany will keep its promises .
berlin has also pledged to raise the percentage of its gross national product spent on aid to 0.56 percent by 2010 - an important intermediary step toward the 2005 target . but the un 's special envoy for hiv / aids in africa , stephan lewis of canada , is more cautious .
" jeffrey sachs is simply accepting the words that were uttered by the german government at the gleneagles summit in 2005 , " lewis said .
" he may well be right , but we wo n't know until 2015 . " lewis has had bad experience with nations not keeping their word .
" i have a healthy scepticism about the tremendous divide between promise and performance , " he said .
" i have to wait and see what 's going to happen .
i ca n't be persuaded that it will happen . " high hopes for merkel but sachs and lewis do credit germany with putting developmental aid high on the agenda for its six-month tenure as eu president . " i assume that germany at this year 's world summit , with the rest of their colleagues in the g8 , will help to ensure that this will happen , " sachs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stressed the aid issue in recent speeches christoph benn , director of external relations for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , credits chancellor angela merkel for germany 's renewed commitment . " germany has an international leadership role this year , " benn said , " and ms. merkel is very conscious of that fact . " benn added that merkel 's speech to the world economic forum last week offered lots of reasons for optimism .
the global fund gets 80 percent of its money from g8 nations and had difficulty paying its bills because donors were late in transferring pledges . even lewis sees a change in germany developmental aid policy .
" the position of current german chancellor seems to be much more energetic in terms of support for the needs of africa and the needs of international development , " lewis said . but he cautioned that 2015 is a long way off , and there was no telling what the g8 nations may do in the meantime . norway as role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan lewis says the time to start fighting poverty is now lewis thinks there 's no reason to wait that long , pointing out that the un actually agreed the 0.7 percent target more than 35 years ago .
most countries have put off trying to achieve that mark , but norway and sweden already devote 0.94 percent of their respective gdps to aid .
that shows , according to lewis , that increasing monetary help for the world 's poorer regions does not harm national economies . lewis calls upon the g8 nations to act now .
" i do n't think we should be waiting until 2015 .
if the norwegians can do it today , the g8 can do it today .

but experts say the mild winter might prevent it spreading . european health commissioner markos kyprianou urged all member states " to step up their vigilance " and to reassess their risk levels following the outbreak at a goose farm in csongrad county , southeastern hungary , according to his spokesman philip tod . an eu-approved laboratory in britain had confirmed that it " was indeed a case of the h5n1 strain , " tod told a press conference in brussels . meanwhile , the hungarian authorities announced a suspected second outbreak in the southeast of the country and said they had responded by slaughtering all 9,400 geese on the farm . " animals suspected of carrying bird flu were found friday on a goose farm in derekegyhaza , " about 170 kilometers -lrb- 105 miles -rrb- southeast of budapest , the agriculture ministry said . samples from that farm were also sent to the laboratory in weybridge , near london , which the commission uses to confirm such cases . tod stressed that in both instances all eu rules had been carried out , including the slaughter of infected flocks , disinfection of affected farms and the setting up of safety zones within a 10-kilometer perimeter . while assuring that no further measures were necessary , tod said fresh outbreaks could not be ruled out . neighbors ban hungarian poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is alarmed by the recurrence of the virus but nearby non-eu countries have taken their own measures , with croatia , serbia and russia banning hungarian poultry exports . meanwhile , new eu member bulgaria responded to the outbreak by banning outdoor poultry markets and putting in place tighter control mechanisms , including border checks , to protect against the spread of bird flu , the agriculture ministry said in a statement . four cases of h5n1 were registered in bulgaria last february in wild swans in the north of the country , but there have been no cases recorded in poultry there . first european recurrence it is the first incidence in the european union of the highly pathogenic avian influenza since august 2006 , when one case occurred in a zoo in dresden , germany .
the virus has killed about 160 people worldwide since late 2003 . the origin of the hungarian outbreak is still being investigated , but wild birds are considered " a strong possibility " by the european commission . between late 2005 and mid-2006 , 13 eu nations - plus romania , which has since become a member - uncovered cases of the h5n1 strain . jean-luc angot , deputy director-general of the world organization for animal health , said in paris on monday that the virus found this month in hungary was " 99.4 percent identical " to the strain that caused outbreaks across europe last year . the extremely close similarity suggests the virus holed up among birds in hungary , enabling it to survive after the end of the outbreak last spring , he said . the weather factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year earlier this month the eu decided to lift its ban on live birds entering the bloc but laid down strict conditions for their import . eu food chain and veterinary experts decided to replace the ban with strict new guidelines that go beyond the rules that were in place before the embargo was imposed in october 2005 amid an earlier bird flu scare . experts have suggested that the exceptionally mild winter might prevent the virus spreading .

lawyers for the family of private jason smith , from hawick , said more soldiers could die if lessons were not learned .
pte smith , 32 , fell ill in temperatures of 60c -lrb- 140f -rrb- and died in august 2003 at the al amara stadium , southern iraq .
andrew walker , oxfordshire 's assistant deputy coroner , recorded a narrative verdict at an inquest last november .
he said pte smith 's death was " caused by a serious failure to recognise and take appropriate steps to address the difficulty that he had in adjusting to the climate . "
internal report but the smith family said the verdict was inadequate and a new inquest was needed to establish the full facts .
they are also threatening legal action against the ministry of defence to force it to release an internal report into the death .
witnesses have told bbc radio four 's file on four requests to provide air conditioning went unheeded and pte smith was not given oxygen which could have saved his life .
one soldier left permanently disabled by heatstroke said officers threatened to cut leave if any more soldiers reported sick with heatstroke .
an mod statement said it was unhelpful to re-examine facts that had already been looked at by a coroner .

the report , from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , warns that the reef 's coral could be bleached because of warmer seas .
ipcc scientists are meeting in paris , and are due to release the first stage of their findings on friday .
the barrier reef is australia 's leading tourist destination .
the draft comments , obtained by the age newspaper , come from the second report which the ipcc will publish this year , dealing with impacts of climate change ; the first reviews the overall scientific picture .
' functionally extinct ' great barrier reef more than 2,000 km long home to 1,500 types of fish only living thing the naked eye can see from space the draft document warns that the great barrier reef will become " functionally extinct " because of coral bleaching - which occurs when the animal organisms that make up the coral die , leaving behind a white limestone skeleton .
bleaching occurs regularly during periods when water becomes unusually warm .
many reefs in east asia declined significantly during the el nino conditions in 1997/8 ; it can take a decade for coral to start recovering from severe bleaching .
but in the future , the barrier reef may not have the chance to recover , scientists warn , as temperatures continue to rise and the sea becomes more acidic .
this raises the risk that the coral will die outright .
the reef attracts a million visitors a year , and is home to sharks , turtles and numerous brightly coloured fish .

the airline says it hopes to operate a " full flying programme " today , but some passengers may experience problems with catering and some delays .
the strike was originally planned to start on monday for three days , but it was postponed and should have started today .
but unions and ba chief executive willie walsh came to an agreement yesterday afternoon .
the decision to call off the strike came too late to prevent disruption to ba 's services out uk airports .
breakfast was live at heathrow airport on tuesday our business presenter declan curry looked at whether the cancelled strike was causing problems for travellers declan said terminal 4 was very quiet , and that ba might be offering some special deal to passengers able to travel at short notice and fill empty seats .
ba could lose millions of pounds as it had already announced details of how passengers could make alternative travel arrangements .
this plan was announced by the airline last week - as soon as the strike dates were announced .

bloggers are responding to the upgrade process , new features , and some problems with the new operating system .
performance tests will upgrading to microsoft 's latest operating system - with all the flashy , resource intensive features and user interface - bring a computer to its knees ?
techgage reports that new features do n't always come at the price of performance : " should you stick with xp to save on performance ?
hardly ... there was not much of a difference between xp and vista overall , i 'm actually quite impressed . "
upgrade advisor microsoft has a vista " upgrade advisor " utility to tell users whether or not their current hardware and software is compatible with the new operating system .
the register ponders the ease of upgrading after the utility identified " mainstream " devices and programs on their top-tier system as incompatible : " i know that my system has all the raw resources needed to run the aero desktop easily under heavy multitasking ... after running the advisor utility , i 'm a good deal less confident that vista will handle my hardware .
i was also warned that some of my software might not be compatible .
there was nothing on the list that would concern me personally or interfere with my forthcoming reviews , but i was quite surprised to find windows messenger included . "
why upgrade ?
though windows vista starts shipping on new pcs 30 from january , 2007 , consumers will be able to buy a boxed copy and upgrade an older computer as well .
tom 's hardware guide asks , why upgrade ? "
for old windows hands , the improved security should be the strongest reason to switch , but it is the overall experience that makes windows vista so smooth .
it installs quickly , it can easily be customized , it connects to other devices and networks much better , and finally , it just ' feels good . " '
' billy g 's ' autograph though many would contend that bill gates is nowhere near as cool as bono , that has n't stopped him from selling an autographed version of windows vista in the us .
and for a premium price as well .
gizmodo 's reports : " best buy has autographed versions of billy g 's limited edition vista ultimate editions for $ 259 ; advertised in your local flyer for vista 's launch on tuesday .
it 's only the upgrade edition -lrb- darn -rrb- , and you 're paying $ 10 over the regular price . "
a disaster recovery disaster ?
unlike prior versions , vista upgrade discs will not work unless an old version of windows is already installed on the computer .
prior generations of windows upgrades checked users ' old installation discs , but did not require an install of the prior version .
ars technica says this will complicate disaster recovery : " for its part , microsoft seems to be confident that the vista repair process should be sufficient to solve any problems with the os , since otherwise the only option for disaster recovery in the absence of backups would be to wipe a machine , install xp , and then upgrade to vista .
this will certainly make disaster recovery a more irritating experience . "
search your stacks one of the key features built into windows vista is a system-wide search tool that lets you save searches in " stacks . "
unlike their real-world counterparts , these stacks organize themselves based on many different criteria .
cnet 's crave blog likes " stacks " : " you can select how you want to create your stack -lrb- or search -rrb- .
for example , if you have thousands of digital images , you can choose to display only those with a certain iso setting , lens model , camera model - or if it 's a song , you can use bit rate , beats-per-minute and so on .
each stack can be saved so you can access it later - a nice touch . "
too secure some of windows vista 's most touted features are security related .
after windows xp suffered from a string of attacks , microsoft has locked down vista from the outset .
the inquirer reports on an anti-virus vendor who feels overly constrained by the new security features : " microsoft , " has made it impossible for security solution vendors to implement certain functionality within their products .
as a result , it 's currently not possible to use the full range of effective tools developed by antivirus vendors in the security area . "
the conclusion is that vista is " undoubtedly more secure than previous operating systems from microsoft " .
and , a system which is configured in such a way that " everything is blocked except for access to designated sites could be regarded as being absolutely secure . "
but that leaves the user constrained . "

experts believe severe flooding on 30 january 1607 in south west england and south wales was caused by a tsunami - and not a storm surge or high tides .
it is estimated 200 square miles -lrb- 520 sq km -rrb- of land were covered by water .
professor simon haslett from bath spa university said there was currently no tsunami warning system in place .
he said the research was important for informing coastal and risk management plans .
' worst natural disaster ' the flood of 1607 has been described by experts as the worst natural disaster to hit britain .
eyewitness accounts of the disaster told of " huge and mighty hills of water " advancing at a speed " faster than a greyhound can run " .
professor haslett carried out extensive research into the cause of the flood alongside australian geologist and tsunami expert ted bryant from the university of wollongong in 2003 .
a woodcut from a 1607 pamphlet shows the devastation the water caused enlarge image " when i was young , i remember seeing in some books in the library some woodcuts of pictures of people stranded on the top of high roofs , trees and clinging onto the back of sheep - very dramatic scenes , " said professor haslett .
" you ca n't really imagine what it must have been like other than the human tragedy of it .
quite catastrophic and how they dealt with it is quite amazing , " he said .
in a timewatch programme shown on bbc 2 , professor haslett and dr bryant revealed evidence around the severn estuary which appeared to back their theory .
this included a layer of sand in mud deposits in five different places : hill in south gloucestershire , rumney wharf in cardiff , llangennith moor in swansea , croyde bay in north devon and northam burrows near bideford , devon .
pebbles and pieces of broken shell were found in these areas .
they claimed these deposits were brought in from the open ocean .

experts believe severe flooding on 30 january 1607 in south west england and south wales was caused by a tsunami - and not a storm surge or high tides .
it is estimated 200 square miles -lrb- 520 sq km -rrb- of land were covered by water .
professor simon haslett from bath spa university said there was currently no tsunami warning system in place .
he said the research was important for informing coastal and risk management plans .
' worst natural disaster ' the flood of 1607 has been described by experts as the worst natural disaster to hit britain .
eyewitness accounts of the disaster told of " huge and mighty hills of water " advancing at a speed " faster than a greyhound can run " .
professor haslett carried out extensive research into the cause of the flood alongside australian geologist and tsunami expert ted bryant from the university of wollongong in 2003 .
a woodcut from a 1607 pamphlet shows the devastation the water caused enlarge image " when i was young , i remember seeing in some books in the library some woodcuts of pictures of people stranded on the top of high roofs , trees and clinging onto the back of sheep - very dramatic scenes , " said professor haslett .
" you ca n't really imagine what it must have been like other than the human tragedy of it .
quite catastrophic and how they dealt with it is quite amazing , " he said .
in a timewatch programme shown on bbc 2 , professor haslett and dr bryant revealed evidence around the severn estuary which appeared to back their theory .
this included a layer of sand in mud deposits in five different places : hill in south gloucestershire , rumney wharf in cardiff , llangennith moor in swansea , croyde bay in north devon and northam burrows near bideford , devon .
pebbles and pieces of broken shell were found in these areas .
they claimed these deposits were brought in from the open ocean .
" there 's no beach for miles so that 's an indication that this stuff has been transported a considerable distance , " said dr bryant .
" the way some of the flow behaves , it will not break the material , so to find material as fragile as this in this type of deposit shows that it was a tsunami . " 1607 flood facts the flood reached a speed of 30mph and a height of 25ft it swept up to four miles inland in north devon , pembrokeshire , glamorgan , monmouthshire , cardiff and somerset .
in low-lying somerset levels , it reached 14 miles inland experts believe a repeat flood would cost £ 13bn ' costliest natural disaster ' another piece of evidence they believe backs up their theory is an eyewitness account which describes seeing " sparks " coming off the top of the wave - a phenomena unique to tsunamis .
" whether it is sand on the marsh , or it 's pebbles in the clay , or it 's erosion on the headland or boulders piled up in key spots , you go for the simplest explanation , and i can put down most of the signs we have seen down to one wave , " said dr bryant .
dr roger musson , head of seismic hazards at the british geological survey , said there are examples of earthquakes in the area caused by an ancient fault off south-west ireland .
one magnitude 4.5 earthquake was recorded there on 8 february 1980 .
" we know from seismological evidence , that we have actually had an earthquake here - so there is a fault and it is moving .

dr musson believes the event was caused by a storm surge but " the idea of putting a large historical earthquake in this spot is not so fanciful . "

the development would take up less land than originally planned and have opening costs of £ 1.4bn - £ 300m less than was initially estimated , said baa .
uttlesford district council last year blocked plans to extend the existing runway at stansted .
members of the stop stansted expansion -lrb- sse -rrb- campaign group are to continue their protest against the plans .
baa said the overall cost of the project would run up to £ 2.2bn down from the £ 2.7bn forecast in 2005 .
subject to planning permission , the runway could be operating by 2015 and accommodate an extra 10m passengers a year .
' environmental catastrophe ' it is expected that one runway will be used for landings , and one for take-offs .
stephen nelson , chief executive officer of baa , said : " this will provide the increased runway capacity that the uk economy needs , good facilities for passengers and value for money for airlines .
" we have also worked hard to reduce the impact on the local environment . "
stop stansted expansion said a second runway would be an " environmental catastrophe " .
the group said it was also concerned about the regional and local impacts if stansted was allowed to grow .
in november , uttlesford council turned down expansion plans for stansted which would have increased passenger numbers , amid objections including the effect on climate change .
environmental campaigners hailed the council 's decision as a benchmark , saying it was the first time climate change had been listed as a reason for refusing a planning application .
terry morgan , stansted 's managing director , said the airport would appeal and seek to have the issue decided by a government inspector at a planning inquiry .

so , casino royale is being released uncut into chinese cinemas .
in the basement of a beijing shopping centre , the series got its first premiere in this country .
before the red carpet was unveiled , several dozen young male cinema ushers stood in line in front of their boss , as if they were soldiers on parade .
they were then sent to kneel in front of safety barriers to separate the film 's visiting stars from the curious crowd of shoppers , fans , and onlookers .
bond arrival ... we 're showing the film in its entirety ...
daniel craig just before the film started , daniel craig came onto the red carpet .
fans took pictures with their mobile phones .
but there was little , if any screaming .
i had one question for the film 's star .
" for a film to be passed in china it can not promote sex , crime , violence , gambling .
do you think that casino royale abides by those rules ? "
" you want me to comment ? " he answered with a very slight grimace .
" the only good thing is that we got it past the censors here and we 're showing the film in its entirety . "

tony blair has ruled against an opt-out despite agencies saying they will close rather than act against their beliefs .
however they are to be given 21 months to adjust to the new regulations .
cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor said he was disappointed , but said he hoped there might still be some way the agencies could " continue their work " .
cardinal murphy-o 'connor , the head of catholics in england and wales , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " some legislation , however well intended , in fact does create a new kind of morality , a new kind of norm - as this does . "
' new norm ' he added : " it does seem to me we are having a new norm for what marriage is , because i think normally children should be brought up by a father and a mother and i think that we hold that that is extremely important .
" the government has a right to legislate and homosexual couples are also able to adopt in other agencies but we want to hold onto this principle . "
mr blair said the proposal was a " sensible compromise " he said the move risked forcing religious people out of public life .
" here the catholic church and its adoption services are wishing to act according to its principles and conscience and the government is saying : ' no , we wo n't allow you to ... you have no space , you have no place in the public life of this country . '
" now that seems to me to be just one step and there will be further ones . "
cabinet ' split ' the equality act , due to come into effect in england , wales and scotland in april , outlaws discrimination in the provision of goods , facilities and services on the basis of sexual orientation .
it means catholic adoption agencies would be forced to consider gay people as prospective parents - currently they are referred to other agencies .
the row was said to have split the cabinet and was opposed by the catholic church , backed by the church of england and some other religious groups .
there may well be some way in which without breaking the law , our catholic services can continue in their work cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor on monday , prime minister tony blair said he had found a " sensible compromise " , allowing faith-based agencies 21 months to adapt to the new rules - monitored by independent assessors .
the proposed measures are likely to face a vote in parliament next month before coming into effect on 6 april .
but cardinal murphy-o 'connor told the bbc : " i 'm very disappointed that we have n't been given the exemption that we desired . "
he said that he hoped catholic adoption agencies could still operate once the transition period was over .
" there may well be some way in which , without breaking the law , our catholic services can continue in their work according to catholic principles . "

tony blair has ruled against an opt-out despite agencies saying they will close rather than act against their beliefs .
however they are to be given 21 months to adjust to the new regulations .
cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor said he was disappointed , but said he hoped there might still be some way the agencies could " continue their work " .
cardinal murphy-o 'connor , the head of catholics in england and wales , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " some legislation , however well intended , in fact does create a new kind of morality , a new kind of norm - as this does . "
' new norm ' he added : " it does seem to me we are having a new norm for what marriage is , because i think normally children should be brought up by a father and a mother and i think that we hold that that is extremely important .
" the government has a right to legislate and homosexual couples are also able to adopt in other agencies but we want to hold onto this principle . "
mr blair said the proposal was a " sensible compromise " he said the move risked forcing religious people out of public life .
" here the catholic church and its adoption services are wishing to act according to its principles and conscience and the government is saying : ' no , we wo n't allow you to ... you have no space , you have no place in the public life of this country . '
" now that seems to me to be just one step and there will be further ones . "
cabinet ' split ' the equality act , due to come into effect in england , wales and scotland in april , outlaws discrimination in the provision of goods , facilities and services on the basis of sexual orientation .
it means catholic adoption agencies would be forced to consider gay people as prospective parents - currently they are referred to other agencies .
the row was said to have split the cabinet and was opposed by the catholic church , backed by the church of england and some other religious groups .
there may well be some way in which without breaking the law , our catholic services can continue in their work cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor on monday , prime minister tony blair said he had found a " sensible compromise " , allowing faith-based agencies 21 months to adapt to the new rules - monitored by independent assessors .
the proposed measures are likely to face a vote in parliament next month before coming into effect on 6 april .
but cardinal murphy-o 'connor told the bbc : " i 'm very disappointed that we have n't been given the exemption that we desired . "
he said that he hoped catholic adoption agencies could still operate once the transition period was over .
" there may well be some way in which , without breaking the law , our catholic services can continue in their work according to catholic principles . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- can microsoft 's vista inspire consumers ?
bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies tuesday , 30 january 2007 , 10:51 gmt can microsoft 's vista inspire consumers ?
by tim weber business editor , bbc news website microsoft has launched the latest version of its windows operating system , called vista .
but can it inspire consumers ?
microsoft founder bill gates is passionate about vista : " for the technology industry , it 's a huge milestone . "
the president of microsoft international , jean-philippe courtois , is equally impressed : " vista is the biggest launch ever " in microsoft 's history , more important than windows 95 .
considering the hype , it must be worrying for microsoft that many technology experts believe that vista is at best accomplished but not really a breakthrough .
vista , they say , is not any better than os x , the operating system of rival apple .
vista pc specifications vista capable 800mhz processor 512mb memory directx9 capable graphics processor premium ready 1ghz processor 1gb memory 128mb graphics memory 40gb hard drive dvd-rom internet access corporate it bosses are not impressed either , surveys suggest .
some will move to vista for security reasons , says george colony , chief executive of technology consulting firm forrester , but most will do so because microsoft is forcing them .
while corporate users may have little choice , it 's with consumers where vista will have to prove its mettle .
here microsoft has not just to capture the market , but also inspire it .
only if vista delivers its promise of managing the digital lifestyle will it become the central hub of consumers ' connected world .
success by default ?
let 's make no mistake : windows vista will be a success .
but it will happen almost by default .
corporate it administrators are tied into microsoft 's network architecture , while consumers will probably pick a pc because they trust brands such as hp , dell or sony and because pc manufacturers simply take up more shelf space than apple 's narrow product range .
" very few consumers will choose to upgrade to vista , " says mr colony .
" nobody is choosing to install it , they will upgrade only by buying a new machine . "
forrester estimates that by the end of this year , vista will have a 15 % share of the north american consumer market , which amounts to about 12.2 million units .
by 2011 it expects vista to have 70 % of the market , or just over 73 million installations .
considering that windows is one of microsoft 's two big profit engines -lrb- the other is the productivity software office -rrb- , executives at the company headquarters in redmond , washington , can probably relax .
but these numbers do not secure microsoft 's future in a rapidly evolving tech landscape .
the problem , says mr colony , is microsoft 's brand perception : a forrester survey of 50,000 consumers suggests that microsoft is the consumer brand with the highest number of installations , but also the company with the second-lowest approval rating among its customers , says mr colony .
' vista is user-centric ' vista is supposed to change that perception and " wow " computer users .
when you use vista , " it 's just not like using software anymore ... it 's more user-centric , less systems-centric , " says mr gates , who is also the firm 's chief software architect .
to make the right first impression , microsoft has scheduled big launch events in 50 countries .
in paris , for example , fireworks will light the sky that will be larger than those at the start of the new millennium .
" this is about capturing the minds of the people , " says mr courtois .
" they have problems -lsb- with their computers -rsb- , need help " and vista is going to provide it .
the boss of microsoft international tries to explain : looks : vista looks much prettier than xp , with a 3d feel to it and see-through windows .
security : " the company has learned its lessons , and bill gates was leading the work to make security central to vista . "
the software will be secure by design and by default , he says , with all security options switched on straight out of the box .
better back-up software will protect your digital memories , parental controls will safeguard your children , and strong encryption software will ensure that a stolen laptop or pc will not give up your personal secrets -lrb- although this part of vista is available only in vista 's most expensive version -rrb- .
connectivity : whatever kind of device you want to connect to , eg using wifi or bluetooth , vista will make it easier ; and a new " meeting room " allows users to share a virtual workspace between computers in the same area .
fun and entertainment : the gaming technology in vista has " increased significantly " .
better graphics boost the quality of game play , and the popular flight simulator , for example , now integrates real-time weather conditions .
watching and working with photos , music and videos has been improved , mr courtois says , and vista comes integrated with microsoft 's media centre , which is optimised to watch media on a television .
search : a fully integrated search function makes it easy to find the needles in the rapidly growing haystacks of our digital lives .
microsoft has not left much to chance .
to iron out bugs , some five million people have tested vista over the past year or two .
in your living room microsoft 's biggest challenge , however , will be for windows to make the jump from the study into our living rooms .
vista home versions home basic - improved search and security but no aero interface -lrb- pictured -rrb- home premium - as above but with aero , media center options , back-up tools , dvd burning software vista ultimate - all home and business features , plus a series of downloadable ultimate extras vista and rivals : your view irritatingly for microsoft executives , this make-or-break move is out of the company 's control .
windows is a platform ; microsoft 's partners build on it by providing hardware and software .
if the industry develops and sells products with the right form factor , combining the beauty and simplicity of hi-fi equipment with the vista operating system , microsoft will sit at the top of our digital world .
forrester 's george colony is dubious about microsoft 's chances of success : " operating systems crash , they do n't give you any pleasure , " he says .
" it 's still too difficult to install and administer computers . "
' two sets of idiots ' so what about the long-awaited convergence between pcs and consumer electronics ?
niklas zennstroem , the co-founder of internet telephony success skype and backer of video-on-demand service joost.com , believes that the " computerisation of television sets " is just a few years away .
mr colony is more sceptical : " you have two sets of idiots here , the pc idiots and the tv idiots , " he says , and neither understands yet how to make convergence work .
so if microsoft 's hardware partners fail to deliver , the company has a problem .
mr courtois for his part points to " an incredible variety of form factors " in the pipeline , from media centres to what he calls " ultra-mobile pcs " .
why the rivals do n't deliver microsoft 's weakness , however , is also its biggest strength .
rival apple may grab the headlines -lrb- and the biggest share of the mp3 player market -rrb- , but in the computer space it is puny .
the reason : apple insists on controlling the whole package , from the operating system to the central hardware .
as a result , apple lacks the breadth of hard- and software that attracts customers .
apple may glow in the halo of its iconic ipods and gain kudos from the tech-savvy crowd .
but so far , the shallowness of apple 's industrial ecosystem has made the firm 's offering pricey and limited its success in the market place .
microsoft 's other rival , the open-source linux operating system , has a similar problem .
even though products like ubuntu and suse linux show great promise , there are still issues with compatibility and ease of use .
beyond vista but as microsoft celebrates vista , the company is already thinking about what comes next .
consumers had to wait five years for the new operating system .
a gap that long wo n't be allowed again , promises mr courtois .
but as it works on the next incarnation of windows , microsoft will have to face a profound shift in the world of software .
more and more companies are offering software online as a service .
all that users need is a good browser .
and that could make operating systems somewhat irrelevant .
last chance so why is vista so important ?
have your say " i 'll run linux on most of my machines , it does everything i need much more easily than windows " john , uk send us your experiences well , it may be microsoft 's last chance to confound the critics who say the company is not capable of developing a secure and user-friendly operating system .
one of vista 's new features is that it shuts down in just two seconds .
microsoft is hoping that its customers wo n't shut down windows for good .
