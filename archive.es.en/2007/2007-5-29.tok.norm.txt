police , however , stopped the protestors before they reached the asem hotel meeting location .
later , hundreds of far-left demonstrators wearing ski masks built a barricade and set it ablaze in an area of hamburg known as a hub for radical leftists .
a police spokesperson said police extinguished the fire and arrested at least 21 demonstrators on suspicion of violence including attacks on security officers and making firebombs .
at least 30 other protestors were detained .
police said one police officer and a female protester were hurt , 21 demonstrators were arrested and a further 30 detained .
warming up for the g8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang demonstrators - including radicals from several european nations - were said to be using the event as a " practice run " for the upcoming group of eight summit to be hosted by germany from june 6-8 at the northern beach resort of heiligendamm .
on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel spoke out in support of the right to demonstrate peacefully and voiced sympathy for environmentalists ' calls for deep cuts in emissions , one of her key demands at the g8 summit .
german authorities , who were likewise treating monday 's event as practice for next month , said they would crack down hard on any rioting .
monday 's demonstrators found themselves marching between a cordon of riot police accompanying the procession .
organizers voiced frustration at the cordon and said that police barriers made it difficult for crowds to disperse following the event .
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked the demonstrators .
" the protesters have a right to demonstrate .
they have a right to raise the issues , " said steinmeier who was hosting the foreign ministers ' talks as part of the german presidency of the eu .
" but i would like to ask them a question back .
why do they demonstrate against a conference where asians and europeans try to establish a shared view on the places of conflict in this world ?

there is discord between european countries seeking deep cuts in world carbon-dioxide emissions and asian governments countering that they have not caused global warming , the three working sessions monday and tuesday are expected to cover issues ranging from crises with iran and north korea to anti-terrorism policies .
on monday in hamburg , myanmar foreign minister nyan win defended his government 's one-year extension of house arrest for nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi , telling japanese foreign minister taro aso that it had been " a very difficult decision . "
a japanese foreign ministry spokesman said that win had explained that the myanmar military junta had been concerned with both " political stability " and negative reactions from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,800 police officers were deployed in hamburg on monday earlier , after an advance meeting with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , german foreign minister steinmeier said that he remained hopeful that agreement on emissions reductions could be reached with china before a world summit on global warming in december in bali .
voicing a sentiment shared by many asian nations , which oppose sharp cuts , yang said that china already had its own targets and made clear that beijing believes it is up to industrialized countries to cut world emissions .
" china is a developing country , and per capita emission of greenhouse gases in china is much lower that in developed nations , " he said .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .

together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .

according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .

it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .

unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .

zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .

ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .

he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "
the report said evidence against ullrich now appeared to be overwhelming . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more confessions as merkel urges doping cyclists to come clean german chancellor angela merkel has urged all cyclists involved in doping to own up and come clean as more confessions from top stars pile up in what is becoming the sport 's biggest ever scandal .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam .

" we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .

according to the paper , the transrapid train would help transport millions of pilgrims along the 800-kilometer -lrb- around 500-mile -rrb- stretch from tehran to iran 's holiest city , mashhad .
a transrapid train ride between the two cities could reduce the trip to two to three hours - a stark contrast to the two days a bus normally needs .

he said that then bavarian economic minister otto wiesheu 's visit to iran in 2004 had helped to lay the groundwork for the negotiations .
wiesheu , who left the bavarian government in 2005 , took up a post as board director of germany 's rail company deutsche bahn .

he also told sz that iran was hoping for additional , private investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad has strained ties apparently , economic sanctions against iran would not stand in the way of the project .

" iran is without a doubt a complicated country , " he told sz .
" but , i hope circumstances and international relations improve , " he added , referring to the country 's controversial nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies repatriating production in reverse trend a rising number of german firms are repatriating their production , breaking the trend of the past decade in which thousands of manufacturing jobs moved out of the country in the drive for lower costs and better markets .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

" we think it is damaging and dangerous to transform europe into a powder keg and fill it with new forms of weapons , " russian president vladimir putin said during a joint press conference in moscow with portuguese prime minister jose socrates .
the comments come amid a stand-off with washington over us plans to place a radar base in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland , part of a missile defense shield to protect against what the united states calls " rogue " states , such as iran and north korea .

that , says dw 's peter philipp , is a huge positive to emerge from the first official diplomatic meeting between the two countries in nearly three decades . where there 's a will , there 's a way - even in " impossible " situations .
that 's what the us and iran have learned after a four-hour meeting of their ambassadors in iraq on monday .
for a long time it was unclear whether the meeting in baghdad would happen at all .
first us president george w. bush made demands that iran was unwilling to fulfill .
then iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamanei hestitated .
but in the end , both sides gave the green light . after almost thirty years of diplomatic silence , one might have thought the americans and the iranians would not have had much to talk about .
but the meeting in the green zone was primarily concerned with iraq , specifically the terrible escalation of violence there in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were the usual recriminations on both sides , with tehran blaming the us-led invasion for the violence , and washington accusing iran of stirring up trouble .
but surprisingly , the two countries discovered that , in essence , they were n't very far apart on the issue .
both want to see a peaceful and secure iraq that ceases to be a source of instability for its neighbors and the entire middle east . it is difficult , of course , for former enemies to admit they see eye to eye , but such an admission would not only be in the best interest of iraq .
it could also lay the groundwork for solving some of the other disputes between america and iran . the signs are n't all that bad .
iran suggested setting up a three-party commission with the us and the iraqi government .
this is a good idea , even if the us ambassador to iraq , ryan crocker , deferred any decisions on such a body to washington .
george bush would be well advised to accept the offer , and tehran should continue to advance it . there are still roadblocks .
it is n't helpful when iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki demands that washington openly acknowledge the failure of its campaign in iraq .
and the detention of five iranians by us forces in northern iraq looms as a thorny issue .
but despite these problems , iran and the us should seize the opportunity to make the impossible become a reality . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran says nuke talks with eu back on hours after cancellation iran announced sunday that crunch talks with the eu to break the deadlock over its disputed nuclear program would go ahead as planned , hours after saying they had been postponed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 29.05.2007 climate change divides foreign ministers at eu-asia meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change requires political consensus on an international level foreign ministers from asia and europe disagreed on tuesday in the german city of hamburg on how to respond to climate change , with china telling the eu that nations had " common but differing responsibilities . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .
there was " a frank exchange of views on myanmar " at asem , the chairman 's statement said .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

" we need multilateral agreements to deal on a global basis with the challenges facing humanity , " merkel said after a meeting with nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives .
pelosi , for her part , stressed her commitment to " save the planet " and said she supported cooperation on climate change as she met with merkel .
pelosi , a democrat who opposes president george w. bush 's environmental policy , also called for " global and sustainable solutions " to halt climate change , including making greater use of advanced technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi praised merkel after tuesday 's meeting , pelosi agreed with merkel that climate change " solutions must be multilateral . "
she praised merkel 's " extraordinary leadership " in addressing the issue of global warming .
merkel said the united states was " moving a lot " on climate change , but made no reference to the differences threatening to derail a deal at the june 6-8 summit in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm .
with just over a week to go before the conference , senior officials of the group of eight wealthy nations will hold a new round of talks this week in an attempt to resolve last-minute differences .
us expected to object the meetings follow objections raised by the us administration to a proposed declaration on global warming to be issued by the leaders of the united states , canada , japan , britain , france , italy , germany and russia .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .

zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .
there was " a frank exchange of views on myanmar " at asem , the chairman 's statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .

the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .

" we need multilateral agreements to deal on a global basis with the challenges facing humanity , " merkel said after a meeting with nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives .
pelosi , for her part , stressed her commitment to " save the planet " and said she supported cooperation on climate change as she met with merkel .
pelosi , a democrat who opposes president george w. bush 's environmental policy , also called for " global and sustainable solutions " to halt climate change , including making greater use of advanced technology .

she praised merkel 's " extraordinary leadership " in addressing the issue of global warming .
merkel said the united states was " moving a lot " on climate change , but made no reference to the differences threatening to derail a deal at the june 6-8 summit in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm .

" we need multilateral agreements to deal on a global basis with the challenges facing humanity , " merkel said after a meeting with nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives .
pelosi , for her part , stressed her commitment to " save the planet " and said she supported cooperation on climate change as she met with merkel .
pelosi , a democrat who opposes president george w. bush 's environmental policy , also called for " global and sustainable solutions " to halt climate change , including making greater use of advanced technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi praised merkel after tuesday 's meeting , pelosi agreed with merkel that climate change " solutions must be multilateral . "
she praised merkel 's " extraordinary leadership " in addressing the issue of global warming .
merkel said the united states was " moving a lot " on climate change , but made no reference to the differences threatening to derail a deal at the june 6-8 summit in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm .
with just over a week to go before the conference , senior officials of the group of eight wealthy nations will hold a new round of talks this week in an attempt to resolve last-minute differences .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .

russia 's military meanwhile successfully tested a new ballistic missile . " we think it is damaging and dangerous to transform europe into a powder keg and fill it with new forms of weapons , " russian president vladimir putin said during a joint press conference in moscow with portuguese prime minister jose socrates .
the comments come amid a stand-off with washington over us plans to place a radar base in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland , part of a missile defense shield to protect against what the united states calls " rogue " states , such as iran and north korea .
russia tests missile russian officials meanwhile announced on tuesday they had successfully tested a new multiple warhead ballistic missile designed to overcome air-defense systems such as the proposed us shield .

" the rs-24 reinforces the military potential of the strategic forces to overcome anti-missile defense systems , " the statement said .
russia 's first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former defense minister and widely seen as a potential successor to president vladimir putin in 2008 , said the rs-24 could overcome any such anti-missile system .
" these complexes are capable of penetrating all existing and perspective anti-missile systems , " he was quoted by interfax .
" so from the point of view of defense and security , russians can look at the future calmly . "

" let 's not talk as if on one side we are dealing with pure , white and fluffy partners and on the other side with a monster that has just left the forest and has claws instead of feet and horns growing , " he said .
" the death sentence in several western countries , secret prisons and torture right in europe , problems with the media in some european countries ... are these also common values ? "
putin asked .
strained relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , is concerned about the state of democracy in russia relations between brussels and moscow have been exacerbated by the concerns of newer eu members that previously were either part of the soviet union or members of the soviet bloc .

after the german leader urged moscow to allow a banned opposition march during a recent eu-russia summit in samara , russia , local authorities approved the march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

" we need multilateral agreements to deal on a global basis with the challenges facing humanity , " merkel said after a meeting with nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives .
pelosi , for her part , stressed her commitment to " save the planet " and said she supported cooperation on climate change as she met with merkel .
pelosi , a democrat who opposes president george w. bush 's environmental policy , also called for " global and sustainable solutions " to halt climate change , including making greater use of advanced technology .

she praised merkel 's " extraordinary leadership " in addressing the issue of global warming .
merkel said the united states was " moving a lot " on climate change , but made no reference to the differences threatening to derail a deal at the june 6-8 summit in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm .
with just over a week to go before the conference , senior officials of the group of eight wealthy nations will hold a new round of talks this week in an attempt to resolve last-minute differences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

" we need multilateral agreements to deal on a global basis with the challenges facing humanity , " merkel said after a meeting with nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives .
pelosi , for her part , stressed her commitment to " save the planet " and said she supported cooperation on climate change as she met with merkel .
pelosi , a democrat who opposes president george w. bush 's environmental policy , also called for " global and sustainable solutions " to halt climate change , including making greater use of advanced technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi praised merkel after tuesday 's meeting , pelosi agreed with merkel that climate change " solutions must be multilateral . "
she praised merkel 's " extraordinary leadership " in addressing the issue of global warming .
merkel said the united states was " moving a lot " on climate change , but made no reference to the differences threatening to derail a deal at the june 6-8 summit in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm .
with just over a week to go before the conference , senior officials of the group of eight wealthy nations will hold a new round of talks this week in an attempt to resolve last-minute differences .
us expected to object the meetings follow objections raised by the us administration to a proposed declaration on global warming to be issued by the leaders of the united states , canada , japan , britain , france , italy , germany and russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.05.2007 us , iran should work together to help iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington and tehran share the same basic goal concerning iraq .
that , says dw 's peter philipp , is a huge positive to emerge from the first official diplomatic meeting between the two countries in nearly three decades . where there 's a will , there 's a way - even in " impossible " situations .
that 's what the us and iran have learned after a four-hour meeting of their ambassadors in iraq on monday .
for a long time it was unclear whether the meeting in baghdad would happen at all .
first us president george w. bush made demands that iran was unwilling to fulfill .
then iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamanei hestitated .
but in the end , both sides gave the green light . after almost thirty years of diplomatic silence , one might have thought the americans and the iranians would not have had much to talk about .
but the meeting in the green zone was primarily concerned with iraq , specifically the terrible escalation of violence there in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were the usual recriminations on both sides , with tehran blaming the us-led invasion for the violence , and washington accusing iran of stirring up trouble .
but surprisingly , the two countries discovered that , in essence , they were n't very far apart on the issue .
both want to see a peaceful and secure iraq that ceases to be a source of instability for its neighbors and the entire middle east . it is difficult , of course , for former enemies to admit they see eye to eye , but such an admission would not only be in the best interest of iraq .
it could also lay the groundwork for solving some of the other disputes between america and iran . the signs are n't all that bad .
iran suggested setting up a three-party commission with the us and the iraqi government .
this is a good idea , even if the us ambassador to iraq , ryan crocker , deferred any decisions on such a body to washington .
george bush would be well advised to accept the offer , and tehran should continue to advance it . there are still roadblocks .
it is n't helpful when iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki demands that washington openly acknowledge the failure of its campaign in iraq .
and the detention of five iranians by us forces in northern iraq looms as a thorny issue .
but despite these problems , iran and the us should seize the opportunity to make the impossible become a reality . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran says nuke talks with eu back on hours after cancellation iran announced sunday that crunch talks with the eu to break the deadlock over its disputed nuclear program would go ahead as planned , hours after saying they had been postponed .

police , however , stopped the protestors before they reached the asem hotel meeting location .
later , hundreds of far-left demonstrators wearing ski masks built a barricade and set it ablaze in an area of hamburg known as a hub for radical leftists .
a police spokesperson said police extinguished the fire and arrested at least 21 demonstrators on suspicion of violence including attacks on security officers and making firebombs .
at least 30 other protestors were detained .
police said one police officer and a female protester were hurt , 21 demonstrators were arrested and a further 30 detained .
warming up for the g8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang demonstrators - including radicals from several european nations - were said to be using the event as a " practice run " for the upcoming group of eight summit to be hosted by germany from june 6-8 at the northern beach resort of heiligendamm .
on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel spoke out in support of the right to demonstrate peacefully and voiced sympathy for environmentalists ' calls for deep cuts in emissions , one of her key demands at the g8 summit .
german authorities , who were likewise treating monday 's event as practice for next month , said they would crack down hard on any rioting .
monday 's demonstrators found themselves marching between a cordon of riot police accompanying the procession .
organizers voiced frustration at the cordon and said that police barriers made it difficult for crowds to disperse following the event .
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked the demonstrators .
" the protesters have a right to demonstrate .
they have a right to raise the issues , " said steinmeier who was hosting the foreign ministers ' talks as part of the german presidency of the eu .
" but i would like to ask them a question back .
why do they demonstrate against a conference where asians and europeans try to establish a shared view on the places of conflict in this world ? " when we have so many places of conflict , we are duty bound to try to find a solution in a spirit of partnership , ' he insisted , then adding : " we are trying . "
big impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asem attendees are meeting behind a security barricade in his opening remarks for the meeting , steinmeier said : " we in the asia-europe meeting represent about 50 percent of gross domestic product , 58 percent of the global population and 60 percent of international trade . "
asem , held every two years , offers ministers or their deputies a chance to talk and does not take any formal decisions .
india , pakistan and mongolia are attending for the first time .
there is discord between european countries seeking deep cuts in world carbon-dioxide emissions and asian governments countering that they have not caused global warming , the three working sessions monday and tuesday are expected to cover issues ranging from crises with iran and north korea to anti-terrorism policies .
on monday in hamburg , myanmar foreign minister nyan win defended his government 's one-year extension of house arrest for nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi , telling japanese foreign minister taro aso that it had been " a very difficult decision . "
a japanese foreign ministry spokesman said that win had explained that the myanmar military junta had been concerned with both " political stability " and negative reactions from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,800 police officers were deployed in hamburg on monday earlier , after an advance meeting with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , german foreign minister steinmeier said that he remained hopeful that agreement on emissions reductions could be reached with china before a world summit on global warming in december in bali .
voicing a sentiment shared by many asian nations , which oppose sharp cuts , yang said that china already had its own targets and made clear that beijing believes it is up to industrialized countries to cut world emissions .
" china is a developing country , and per capita emission of greenhouse gases in china is much lower that in developed nations , " he said .
darfur crisis in a bilateral meeting with china , the european union pressed beijing to open its markets to help redress a " huge " trade surplus with the bloc and appealed to the country to ratify a key rights covenant that also covers labor rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some used humor to protest france , for its part , used the meeting to propose opening a humanitarian corridor through chad to bring relief to victims of the darfur conflict , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said late monday .
the sudanese government has repeatedly rejected plans to deploy un troops alongside the african peacekeepers in a joint force numbering some 23,000 soldiers .
khartoum 's hand has been strengthened by china , which has opposed us-led plans within the un security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to accept a un force .
kouchner spent an hour in one-on-one talks with yang on the sidelines of the asem meeting in a bid to bring china fully on board in efforts to resolve the darfur crisis . dw staff dpa / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for us support on g8 climate pact german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that berlin would battle with washington " to the last minute " to win us backing for a strong stand on climate change at the g8 summit .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "

police , however , stopped the protestors before they reached the asem hotel meeting location .
later , hundreds of far-left demonstrators wearing ski masks built a barricade and set it ablaze in an area of hamburg known as a hub for radical leftists .
a police spokesperson said police extinguished the fire and arrested at least 21 demonstrators on suspicion of violence including attacks on security officers and making firebombs .
at least 30 other protestors were detained .
police said one police officer and a female protester were hurt , 21 demonstrators were arrested and a further 30 detained .
warming up for the g8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang demonstrators - including radicals from several european nations - were said to be using the event as a " practice run " for the upcoming group of eight summit to be hosted by germany from june 6-8 at the northern beach resort of heiligendamm .
on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel spoke out in support of the right to demonstrate peacefully and voiced sympathy for environmentalists ' calls for deep cuts in emissions , one of her key demands at the g8 summit .
german authorities , who were likewise treating monday 's event as practice for next month , said they would crack down hard on any rioting .
monday 's demonstrators found themselves marching between a cordon of riot police accompanying the procession .
organizers voiced frustration at the cordon and said that police barriers made it difficult for crowds to disperse following the event .
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked the demonstrators .
" the protesters have a right to demonstrate .
they have a right to raise the issues , " said steinmeier who was hosting the foreign ministers ' talks as part of the german presidency of the eu .
" but i would like to ask them a question back .
why do they demonstrate against a conference where asians and europeans try to establish a shared view on the places of conflict in this world ? " when we have so many places of conflict , we are duty bound to try to find a solution in a spirit of partnership , ' he insisted , then adding : " we are trying . "
big impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asem attendees are meeting behind a security barricade in his opening remarks for the meeting , steinmeier said : " we in the asia-europe meeting represent about 50 percent of gross domestic product , 58 percent of the global population and 60 percent of international trade . "
asem , held every two years , offers ministers or their deputies a chance to talk and does not take any formal decisions .
india , pakistan and mongolia are attending for the first time .
there is discord between european countries seeking deep cuts in world carbon-dioxide emissions and asian governments countering that they have not caused global warming , the three working sessions monday and tuesday are expected to cover issues ranging from crises with iran and north korea to anti-terrorism policies .
on monday in hamburg , myanmar foreign minister nyan win defended his government 's one-year extension of house arrest for nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi , telling japanese foreign minister taro aso that it had been " a very difficult decision . "
a japanese foreign ministry spokesman said that win had explained that the myanmar military junta had been concerned with both " political stability " and negative reactions from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,800 police officers were deployed in hamburg on monday earlier , after an advance meeting with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , german foreign minister steinmeier said that he remained hopeful that agreement on emissions reductions could be reached with china before a world summit on global warming in december in bali .
voicing a sentiment shared by many asian nations , which oppose sharp cuts , yang said that china already had its own targets and made clear that beijing believes it is up to industrialized countries to cut world emissions .
" china is a developing country , and per capita emission of greenhouse gases in china is much lower that in developed nations , " he said .
darfur crisis in a bilateral meeting with china , the european union pressed beijing to open its markets to help redress a " huge " trade surplus with the bloc and appealed to the country to ratify a key rights covenant that also covers labor rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some used humor to protest france , for its part , used the meeting to propose opening a humanitarian corridor through chad to bring relief to victims of the darfur conflict , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said late monday .
the sudanese government has repeatedly rejected plans to deploy un troops alongside the african peacekeepers in a joint force numbering some 23,000 soldiers .
khartoum 's hand has been strengthened by china , which has opposed us-led plans within the un security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to accept a un force .
kouchner spent an hour in one-on-one talks with yang on the sidelines of the asem meeting in a bid to bring china fully on board in efforts to resolve the darfur crisis . dw staff dpa / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for us support on g8 climate pact german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that berlin would battle with washington " to the last minute " to win us backing for a strong stand on climate change at the g8 summit .

according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .

it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .

the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .
there was " a frank exchange of views on myanmar " at asem , the chairman 's statement said .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "
the report said evidence against ullrich now appeared to be overwhelming . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more confessions as merkel urges doping cyclists to come clean german chancellor angela merkel has urged all cyclists involved in doping to own up and come clean as more confessions from top stars pile up in what is becoming the sport 's biggest ever scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

that , says dw 's peter philipp , is a huge positive to emerge from the first official diplomatic meeting between the two countries in nearly three decades . where there 's a will , there 's a way - even in " impossible " situations .
that 's what the us and iran have learned after a four-hour meeting of their ambassadors in iraq on monday .
for a long time it was unclear whether the meeting in baghdad would happen at all .
first us president george w. bush made demands that iran was unwilling to fulfill .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

police , however , stopped the protestors before they reached the asem hotel meeting location .
later , hundreds of far-left demonstrators wearing ski masks built a barricade and set it ablaze in an area of hamburg known as a hub for radical leftists .
a police spokesperson said police extinguished the fire and arrested at least 21 demonstrators on suspicion of violence including attacks on security officers and making firebombs .
at least 30 other protestors were detained .
police said one police officer and a female protester were hurt , 21 demonstrators were arrested and a further 30 detained .
warming up for the g8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang demonstrators - including radicals from several european nations - were said to be using the event as a " practice run " for the upcoming group of eight summit to be hosted by germany from june 6-8 at the northern beach resort of heiligendamm .
on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel spoke out in support of the right to demonstrate peacefully and voiced sympathy for environmentalists ' calls for deep cuts in emissions , one of her key demands at the g8 summit .
german authorities , who were likewise treating monday 's event as practice for next month , said they would crack down hard on any rioting .
monday 's demonstrators found themselves marching between a cordon of riot police accompanying the procession .
organizers voiced frustration at the cordon and said that police barriers made it difficult for crowds to disperse following the event .
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked the demonstrators .
" the protesters have a right to demonstrate .
they have a right to raise the issues , " said steinmeier who was hosting the foreign ministers ' talks as part of the german presidency of the eu .
" but i would like to ask them a question back .
why do they demonstrate against a conference where asians and europeans try to establish a shared view on the places of conflict in this world ? " when we have so many places of conflict , we are duty bound to try to find a solution in a spirit of partnership , ' he insisted , then adding : " we are trying . "
big impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asem attendees are meeting behind a security barricade in his opening remarks for the meeting , steinmeier said : " we in the asia-europe meeting represent about 50 percent of gross domestic product , 58 percent of the global population and 60 percent of international trade . "
asem , held every two years , offers ministers or their deputies a chance to talk and does not take any formal decisions .
india , pakistan and mongolia are attending for the first time .
there is discord between european countries seeking deep cuts in world carbon-dioxide emissions and asian governments countering that they have not caused global warming , the three working sessions monday and tuesday are expected to cover issues ranging from crises with iran and north korea to anti-terrorism policies .
on monday in hamburg , myanmar foreign minister nyan win defended his government 's one-year extension of house arrest for nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi , telling japanese foreign minister taro aso that it had been " a very difficult decision . "
a japanese foreign ministry spokesman said that win had explained that the myanmar military junta had been concerned with both " political stability " and negative reactions from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,800 police officers were deployed in hamburg on monday earlier , after an advance meeting with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , german foreign minister steinmeier said that he remained hopeful that agreement on emissions reductions could be reached with china before a world summit on global warming in december in bali .
voicing a sentiment shared by many asian nations , which oppose sharp cuts , yang said that china already had its own targets and made clear that beijing believes it is up to industrialized countries to cut world emissions .
" china is a developing country , and per capita emission of greenhouse gases in china is much lower that in developed nations , " he said .
darfur crisis in a bilateral meeting with china , the european union pressed beijing to open its markets to help redress a " huge " trade surplus with the bloc and appealed to the country to ratify a key rights covenant that also covers labor rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some used humor to protest france , for its part , used the meeting to propose opening a humanitarian corridor through chad to bring relief to victims of the darfur conflict , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said late monday .
the sudanese government has repeatedly rejected plans to deploy un troops alongside the african peacekeepers in a joint force numbering some 23,000 soldiers .
khartoum 's hand has been strengthened by china , which has opposed us-led plans within the un security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to accept a un force .
kouchner spent an hour in one-on-one talks with yang on the sidelines of the asem meeting in a bid to bring china fully on board in efforts to resolve the darfur crisis . dw staff dpa / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for us support on g8 climate pact german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that berlin would battle with washington " to the last minute " to win us backing for a strong stand on climate change at the g8 summit .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .

riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .

that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup . kristiansen strike in the 109th minute at berlin 's olympic stadium made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
" i was delighted with the goal , " said kristiansen , who has won nine caps for his country .
" i knew i had hit it well , but it was a great feeling when it went in .
the boys are over the moon , it has been a fantastic and superb night , there will be quite a party . "
stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , playing his last game before leaving to join spanish club valencia , said his side went down with a fight .
" we threw everything in and fought hard with ten men , " he said .
" the referee did not have his best day , but i am proud of the boys , they gave everything and worked hard just like they have done all season . "
having beaten stuttgart home and away in the league , this was nuremberg 's third win of the season over their rivals - their first german cup win since 1962 - but the hans meyer-coached side had to come from behind .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "
the report said evidence against ullrich now appeared to be overwhelming . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more confessions as merkel urges doping cyclists to come clean german chancellor angela merkel has urged all cyclists involved in doping to own up and come clean as more confessions from top stars pile up in what is becoming the sport 's biggest ever scandal .

according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .

" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .

that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup . kristiansen strike in the 109th minute at berlin 's olympic stadium made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
" i was delighted with the goal , " said kristiansen , who has won nine caps for his country .
" i knew i had hit it well , but it was a great feeling when it went in .
the boys are over the moon , it has been a fantastic and superb night , there will be quite a party . "
stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , playing his last game before leaving to join spanish club valencia , said his side went down with a fight .
" we threw everything in and fought hard with ten men , " he said .
" the referee did not have his best day , but i am proud of the boys , they gave everything and worked hard just like they have done all season . "
having beaten stuttgart home and away in the league , this was nuremberg 's third win of the season over their rivals - their first german cup win since 1962 - but the hans meyer-coached side had to come from behind .

first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then portuguese defender fernando meira earned himself a yellow card for a terrible tackle on mintel , who had to be stretchered off after 32 minutes .
penalty leads top extra-time and dramatic finale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez is brought down for vfb 's late penalty the first-half finished 1-1 , but nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when spanish defender horacio pinola drilled in a corner and german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go schaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area .
referee michael weiner wasted no time pointing to the spot , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

russia 's military meanwhile successfully tested a new ballistic missile . " we think it is damaging and dangerous to transform europe into a powder keg and fill it with new forms of weapons , " russian president vladimir putin said during a joint press conference in moscow with portuguese prime minister jose socrates .
the comments come amid a stand-off with washington over us plans to place a radar base in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland , part of a missile defense shield to protect against what the united states calls " rogue " states , such as iran and north korea .
russia tests missile russian officials meanwhile announced on tuesday they had successfully tested a new multiple warhead ballistic missile designed to overcome air-defense systems such as the proposed us shield .

" the rs-24 reinforces the military potential of the strategic forces to overcome anti-missile defense systems , " the statement said .
russia 's first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former defense minister and widely seen as a potential successor to president vladimir putin in 2008 , said the rs-24 could overcome any such anti-missile system .

" let 's not talk as if on one side we are dealing with pure , white and fluffy partners and on the other side with a monster that has just left the forest and has claws instead of feet and horns growing , " he said .
" the death sentence in several western countries , secret prisons and torture right in europe , problems with the media in some european countries ... are these also common values ? "
putin asked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said .

that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup . kristiansen strike in the 109th minute at berlin 's olympic stadium made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
" i was delighted with the goal , " said kristiansen , who has won nine caps for his country .
" i knew i had hit it well , but it was a great feeling when it went in .
the boys are over the moon , it has been a fantastic and superb night , there will be quite a party . "
stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , playing his last game before leaving to join spanish club valencia , said his side went down with a fight .
" we threw everything in and fought hard with ten men , " he said .
" the referee did not have his best day , but i am proud of the boys , they gave everything and worked hard just like they have done all season . "
having beaten stuttgart home and away in the league , this was nuremberg 's third win of the season over their rivals - their first german cup win since 1962 - but the hans meyer-coached side had to come from behind .

first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then portuguese defender fernando meira earned himself a yellow card for a terrible tackle on mintel , who had to be stretchered off after 32 minutes .
penalty leads top extra-time and dramatic finale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez is brought down for vfb 's late penalty the first-half finished 1-1 , but nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when spanish defender horacio pinola drilled in a corner and german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go schaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area .
referee michael weiner wasted no time pointing to the spot , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .
there was " a frank exchange of views on myanmar " at asem , the chairman 's statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 29.05.2007 hundreds clash with police during eu-asia meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and protestors faced off in hamburg police used water canons and arrested left-wing demonstrators on the sidelines of an eu-asia meeting of foreign ministers in hamburg on monday . the two-day asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- involving 43 nations which began monday was overshadowed by clashes between police and an estimated 4,000 left-wing demonstrators . an estimated 4,000 anti-globalization protesters marched toward the summit venue , using it to gear up for next month 's demonstrations at the g8 economic summit .
police , however , stopped the protestors before they reached the asem hotel meeting location .
later , hundreds of far-left demonstrators wearing ski masks built a barricade and set it ablaze in an area of hamburg known as a hub for radical leftists .
a police spokesperson said police extinguished the fire and arrested at least 21 demonstrators on suspicion of violence including attacks on security officers and making firebombs .
at least 30 other protestors were detained .
police said one police officer and a female protester were hurt , 21 demonstrators were arrested and a further 30 detained .
warming up for the g8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang demonstrators - including radicals from several european nations - were said to be using the event as a " practice run " for the upcoming group of eight summit to be hosted by germany from june 6-8 at the northern beach resort of heiligendamm .
on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel spoke out in support of the right to demonstrate peacefully and voiced sympathy for environmentalists ' calls for deep cuts in emissions , one of her key demands at the g8 summit .
german authorities , who were likewise treating monday 's event as practice for next month , said they would crack down hard on any rioting .
monday 's demonstrators found themselves marching between a cordon of riot police accompanying the procession .
organizers voiced frustration at the cordon and said that police barriers made it difficult for crowds to disperse following the event .
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked the demonstrators .
" the protesters have a right to demonstrate .
they have a right to raise the issues , " said steinmeier who was hosting the foreign ministers ' talks as part of the german presidency of the eu .
" but i would like to ask them a question back .
why do they demonstrate against a conference where asians and europeans try to establish a shared view on the places of conflict in this world ? " when we have so many places of conflict , we are duty bound to try to find a solution in a spirit of partnership , ' he insisted , then adding : " we are trying . "
big impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asem attendees are meeting behind a security barricade in his opening remarks for the meeting , steinmeier said : " we in the asia-europe meeting represent about 50 percent of gross domestic product , 58 percent of the global population and 60 percent of international trade . "
asem , held every two years , offers ministers or their deputies a chance to talk and does not take any formal decisions .
india , pakistan and mongolia are attending for the first time .
there is discord between european countries seeking deep cuts in world carbon-dioxide emissions and asian governments countering that they have not caused global warming , the three working sessions monday and tuesday are expected to cover issues ranging from crises with iran and north korea to anti-terrorism policies .
on monday in hamburg , myanmar foreign minister nyan win defended his government 's one-year extension of house arrest for nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi , telling japanese foreign minister taro aso that it had been " a very difficult decision . "
a japanese foreign ministry spokesman said that win had explained that the myanmar military junta had been concerned with both " political stability " and negative reactions from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,800 police officers were deployed in hamburg on monday earlier , after an advance meeting with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , german foreign minister steinmeier said that he remained hopeful that agreement on emissions reductions could be reached with china before a world summit on global warming in december in bali .
voicing a sentiment shared by many asian nations , which oppose sharp cuts , yang said that china already had its own targets and made clear that beijing believes it is up to industrialized countries to cut world emissions .
" china is a developing country , and per capita emission of greenhouse gases in china is much lower that in developed nations , " he said .
darfur crisis in a bilateral meeting with china , the european union pressed beijing to open its markets to help redress a " huge " trade surplus with the bloc and appealed to the country to ratify a key rights covenant that also covers labor rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some used humor to protest france , for its part , used the meeting to propose opening a humanitarian corridor through chad to bring relief to victims of the darfur conflict , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said late monday .
the sudanese government has repeatedly rejected plans to deploy un troops alongside the african peacekeepers in a joint force numbering some 23,000 soldiers .
khartoum 's hand has been strengthened by china , which has opposed us-led plans within the un security council to use sanctions to force president omar al-beshir to accept a un force .
kouchner spent an hour in one-on-one talks with yang on the sidelines of the asem meeting in a bid to bring china fully on board in efforts to resolve the darfur crisis . dw staff dpa / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for us support on g8 climate pact german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that berlin would battle with washington " to the last minute " to win us backing for a strong stand on climate change at the g8 summit .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .
the eu-china meeting took place on the sidelines on an asem meeting of eu and asian nations in hamburg which concludes on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany renews criticism of us stance on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel said germany had been frustrated by the difficulties of reaching agreement on climate change with the united states .
-lrb- 28.05.2007 -rrb- us on collision course with g8 partners over climate agreement the prospect looms of a major clash between the united states and its g8 partners over global warming , with washington 's view threatening to block agreement at next month 's summit of the leading industrial nations .
-lrb- 27.05.2007 -rrb- merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .

police , however , stopped the protestors before they reached the asem hotel meeting location .
later , hundreds of far-left demonstrators wearing ski masks built a barricade and set it ablaze in an area of hamburg known as a hub for radical leftists .
a police spokesperson said police extinguished the fire and arrested at least 21 demonstrators on suspicion of violence including attacks on security officers and making firebombs .
at least 30 other protestors were detained .
police said one police officer and a female protester were hurt , 21 demonstrators were arrested and a further 30 detained .
warming up for the g8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang demonstrators - including radicals from several european nations - were said to be using the event as a " practice run " for the upcoming group of eight summit to be hosted by germany from june 6-8 at the northern beach resort of heiligendamm .
on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel spoke out in support of the right to demonstrate peacefully and voiced sympathy for environmentalists ' calls for deep cuts in emissions , one of her key demands at the g8 summit .
german authorities , who were likewise treating monday 's event as practice for next month , said they would crack down hard on any rioting .
monday 's demonstrators found themselves marching between a cordon of riot police accompanying the procession .
organizers voiced frustration at the cordon and said that police barriers made it difficult for crowds to disperse following the event .
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked the demonstrators .
" the protesters have a right to demonstrate .
they have a right to raise the issues , " said steinmeier who was hosting the foreign ministers ' talks as part of the german presidency of the eu .
" but i would like to ask them a question back .
why do they demonstrate against a conference where asians and europeans try to establish a shared view on the places of conflict in this world ? " when we have so many places of conflict , we are duty bound to try to find a solution in a spirit of partnership , ' he insisted , then adding : " we are trying . "
big impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asem attendees are meeting behind a security barricade in his opening remarks for the meeting , steinmeier said : " we in the asia-europe meeting represent about 50 percent of gross domestic product , 58 percent of the global population and 60 percent of international trade . "
asem , held every two years , offers ministers or their deputies a chance to talk and does not take any formal decisions .
india , pakistan and mongolia are attending for the first time .
there is discord between european countries seeking deep cuts in world carbon-dioxide emissions and asian governments countering that they have not caused global warming , the three working sessions monday and tuesday are expected to cover issues ranging from crises with iran and north korea to anti-terrorism policies .
on monday in hamburg , myanmar foreign minister nyan win defended his government 's one-year extension of house arrest for nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi , telling japanese foreign minister taro aso that it had been " a very difficult decision . "
a japanese foreign ministry spokesman said that win had explained that the myanmar military junta had been concerned with both " political stability " and negative reactions from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,800 police officers were deployed in hamburg on monday earlier , after an advance meeting with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , german foreign minister steinmeier said that he remained hopeful that agreement on emissions reductions could be reached with china before a world summit on global warming in december in bali .
voicing a sentiment shared by many asian nations , which oppose sharp cuts , yang said that china already had its own targets and made clear that beijing believes it is up to industrialized countries to cut world emissions .
" china is a developing country , and per capita emission of greenhouse gases in china is much lower that in developed nations , " he said .
darfur crisis in a bilateral meeting with china , the european union pressed beijing to open its markets to help redress a " huge " trade surplus with the bloc and appealed to the country to ratify a key rights covenant that also covers labor rights .

that , says dw 's peter philipp , is a huge positive to emerge from the first official diplomatic meeting between the two countries in nearly three decades . where there 's a will , there 's a way - even in " impossible " situations .
that 's what the us and iran have learned after a four-hour meeting of their ambassadors in iraq on monday .
for a long time it was unclear whether the meeting in baghdad would happen at all .
first us president george w. bush made demands that iran was unwilling to fulfill .
then iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamanei hestitated .
but in the end , both sides gave the green light . after almost thirty years of diplomatic silence , one might have thought the americans and the iranians would not have had much to talk about .
but the meeting in the green zone was primarily concerned with iraq , specifically the terrible escalation of violence there in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were the usual recriminations on both sides , with tehran blaming the us-led invasion for the violence , and washington accusing iran of stirring up trouble .

both want to see a peaceful and secure iraq that ceases to be a source of instability for its neighbors and the entire middle east . it is difficult , of course , for former enemies to admit they see eye to eye , but such an admission would not only be in the best interest of iraq .
it could also lay the groundwork for solving some of the other disputes between america and iran . the signs are n't all that bad .
iran suggested setting up a three-party commission with the us and the iraqi government .
this is a good idea , even if the us ambassador to iraq , ryan crocker , deferred any decisions on such a body to washington .

that , says dw 's peter philipp , is a huge positive to emerge from the first official diplomatic meeting between the two countries in nearly three decades . where there 's a will , there 's a way - even in " impossible " situations .
that 's what the us and iran have learned after a four-hour meeting of their ambassadors in iraq on monday .
for a long time it was unclear whether the meeting in baghdad would happen at all .
first us president george w. bush made demands that iran was unwilling to fulfill .
then iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamanei hestitated .
but in the end , both sides gave the green light . after almost thirty years of diplomatic silence , one might have thought the americans and the iranians would not have had much to talk about .
but the meeting in the green zone was primarily concerned with iraq , specifically the terrible escalation of violence there in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were the usual recriminations on both sides , with tehran blaming the us-led invasion for the violence , and washington accusing iran of stirring up trouble .
but surprisingly , the two countries discovered that , in essence , they were n't very far apart on the issue .
both want to see a peaceful and secure iraq that ceases to be a source of instability for its neighbors and the entire middle east . it is difficult , of course , for former enemies to admit they see eye to eye , but such an admission would not only be in the best interest of iraq .
it could also lay the groundwork for solving some of the other disputes between america and iran . the signs are n't all that bad .
iran suggested setting up a three-party commission with the us and the iraqi government .
this is a good idea , even if the us ambassador to iraq , ryan crocker , deferred any decisions on such a body to washington .
george bush would be well advised to accept the offer , and tehran should continue to advance it . there are still roadblocks .
it is n't helpful when iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki demands that washington openly acknowledge the failure of its campaign in iraq .
and the detention of five iranians by us forces in northern iraq looms as a thorny issue .
but despite these problems , iran and the us should seize the opportunity to make the impossible become a reality . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran says nuke talks with eu back on hours after cancellation iran announced sunday that crunch talks with the eu to break the deadlock over its disputed nuclear program would go ahead as planned , hours after saying they had been postponed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 29.05.2007 iran considers transrapid route designed by german firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train in shanghai using german technology the german version of the magnetic levitation train - transrapid - may be built in the pilgrim city of mashhad in north-eastern iran , a german newspaper reported . germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- reported that a munich-based engineering firm has received a request about the viability of such a transrapid route in iran .
according to the paper , the transrapid train would help transport millions of pilgrims along the 800-kilometer -lrb- around 500-mile -rrb- stretch from tehran to iran 's holiest city , mashhad .
a transrapid train ride between the two cities could reduce the trip to two to three hours - a stark contrast to the two days a bus normally needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire on shanghai 's maglev train last year harald späth , managing director of the firm regierungsbaumeister schlegel gmbh , told sz that his company had received an official contract to investigate whether or not the high-speed magnetic levitation train could be built .
he said that then bavarian economic minister otto wiesheu 's visit to iran in 2004 had helped to lay the groundwork for the negotiations .
wiesheu , who left the bavarian government in 2005 , took up a post as board director of germany 's rail company deutsche bahn .
uncertain future späth , who said he had met with iran 's ambassador in berlin , mohammad akhondzadeh , last week in berlin to discuss the project , said that the iranian had allocated $ 1.5 billion -lrb- 1.1 billion euros -rrb- as " start-up financing " for the project .
he also told sz that iran was hoping for additional , private investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad has strained ties apparently , economic sanctions against iran would not stand in the way of the project .
according to sz , german companies exported more than four billion euros in products and services to iran last year .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .
a headline in germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild summarized the cycling situation : " jan , we no longer need your confession . "

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .

but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .

the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 29.05.2007 european data privacy officials worry about big brother google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page -lrb- left -rrb- and sergey brin the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .
eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

russia 's military meanwhile successfully tested a new ballistic missile . " we think it is damaging and dangerous to transform europe into a powder keg and fill it with new forms of weapons , " russian president vladimir putin said during a joint press conference in moscow with portuguese prime minister jose socrates .
the comments come amid a stand-off with washington over us plans to place a radar base in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in poland , part of a missile defense shield to protect against what the united states calls " rogue " states , such as iran and north korea .
russia tests missile russian officials meanwhile announced on tuesday they had successfully tested a new multiple warhead ballistic missile designed to overcome air-defense systems such as the proposed us shield .

" the rs-24 reinforces the military potential of the strategic forces to overcome anti-missile defense systems , " the statement said .

according to the paper , the transrapid train would help transport millions of pilgrims along the 800-kilometer -lrb- around 500-mile -rrb- stretch from tehran to iran 's holiest city , mashhad .
a transrapid train ride between the two cities could reduce the trip to two to three hours - a stark contrast to the two days a bus normally needs .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .

together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .

according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .

it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .

zabel admitted last thursday to epo blood doping in the 1990s while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
a milram team statement said zabel 's contract , which runs until the end of 2008 , will continue initially for the rest of this year and is then subject to a final legal review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel had red eyes during his confession last week a decision will be made about whether the three-year contract will continue until the end of 2008 .
cycling 's true tales zabel 's doping admission followed earlier confessions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful cycling team .
zabel won the green jersey for best sprinter at the tour de france six times .
he admitted to using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week due to side-effects .
zabel was a team-mate of danish rider bjarne riis and the german jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 for team telekom respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich -lrb- c -rrb- retired in february last friday , riis ended months of speculation by admitting he had used epo , or erythropoietin - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in his 1996 tour win .
riis said he had used banned substances between 1993 and 1998 - among the most successful years of his career .
ullrich has repeatedly denied doping allegations and has made no statement in the wake of last week 's doping admissions by seven former telekom riders .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said .

the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said .

" fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works .

according to the paper , the transrapid train would help transport millions of pilgrims along the 800-kilometer -lrb- around 500-mile -rrb- stretch from tehran to iran 's holiest city , mashhad .
a transrapid train ride between the two cities could reduce the trip to two to three hours - a stark contrast to the two days a bus normally needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire on shanghai 's maglev train last year harald späth , managing director of the firm regierungsbaumeister schlegel gmbh , told sz that his company had received an official contract to investigate whether or not the high-speed magnetic levitation train could be built .
he said that then bavarian economic minister otto wiesheu 's visit to iran in 2004 had helped to lay the groundwork for the negotiations .
wiesheu , who left the bavarian government in 2005 , took up a post as board director of germany 's rail company deutsche bahn .
uncertain future späth , who said he had met with iran 's ambassador in berlin , mohammad akhondzadeh , last week in berlin to discuss the project , said that the iranian had allocated $ 1.5 billion -lrb- 1.1 billion euros -rrb- as " start-up financing " for the project .
he also told sz that iran was hoping for additional , private investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad has strained ties apparently , economic sanctions against iran would not stand in the way of the project .
according to sz , german companies exported more than four billion euros in products and services to iran last year .
wiesheu said that the project is " in the very early stages " in iran .
" iran is without a doubt a complicated country , " he told sz .
" but , i hope circumstances and international relations improve , " he added , referring to the country 's controversial nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies repatriating production in reverse trend a rising number of german firms are repatriating their production , breaking the trend of the past decade in which thousands of manufacturing jobs moved out of the country in the drive for lower costs and better markets .

that , says dw 's peter philipp , is a huge positive to emerge from the first official diplomatic meeting between the two countries in nearly three decades . where there 's a will , there 's a way - even in " impossible " situations .
that 's what the us and iran have learned after a four-hour meeting of their ambassadors in iraq on monday .
for a long time it was unclear whether the meeting in baghdad would happen at all .
first us president george w. bush made demands that iran was unwilling to fulfill .
then iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamanei hestitated .
but in the end , both sides gave the green light . after almost thirty years of diplomatic silence , one might have thought the americans and the iranians would not have had much to talk about .
but the meeting in the green zone was primarily concerned with iraq , specifically the terrible escalation of violence there in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were the usual recriminations on both sides , with tehran blaming the us-led invasion for the violence , and washington accusing iran of stirring up trouble .
but surprisingly , the two countries discovered that , in essence , they were n't very far apart on the issue .
both want to see a peaceful and secure iraq that ceases to be a source of instability for its neighbors and the entire middle east . it is difficult , of course , for former enemies to admit they see eye to eye , but such an admission would not only be in the best interest of iraq .
it could also lay the groundwork for solving some of the other disputes between america and iran . the signs are n't all that bad .
iran suggested setting up a three-party commission with the us and the iraqi government .
this is a good idea , even if the us ambassador to iraq , ryan crocker , deferred any decisions on such a body to washington .
george bush would be well advised to accept the offer , and tehran should continue to advance it . there are still roadblocks .
it is n't helpful when iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki demands that washington openly acknowledge the failure of its campaign in iraq .
and the detention of five iranians by us forces in northern iraq looms as a thorny issue .
but despite these problems , iran and the us should seize the opportunity to make the impossible become a reality . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran says nuke talks with eu back on hours after cancellation iran announced sunday that crunch talks with the eu to break the deadlock over its disputed nuclear program would go ahead as planned , hours after saying they had been postponed .

-lrb- 27.05.2007 -rrb- germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

that , says dw 's peter philipp , is a huge positive to emerge from the first official diplomatic meeting between the two countries in nearly three decades . where there 's a will , there 's a way - even in " impossible " situations .
that 's what the us and iran have learned after a four-hour meeting of their ambassadors in iraq on monday .
for a long time it was unclear whether the meeting in baghdad would happen at all .
first us president george w. bush made demands that iran was unwilling to fulfill .
then iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamanei hestitated .
but in the end , both sides gave the green light . after almost thirty years of diplomatic silence , one might have thought the americans and the iranians would not have had much to talk about .
but the meeting in the green zone was primarily concerned with iraq , specifically the terrible escalation of violence there in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were the usual recriminations on both sides , with tehran blaming the us-led invasion for the violence , and washington accusing iran of stirring up trouble .
but surprisingly , the two countries discovered that , in essence , they were n't very far apart on the issue .
both want to see a peaceful and secure iraq that ceases to be a source of instability for its neighbors and the entire middle east . it is difficult , of course , for former enemies to admit they see eye to eye , but such an admission would not only be in the best interest of iraq .
it could also lay the groundwork for solving some of the other disputes between america and iran . the signs are n't all that bad .
iran suggested setting up a three-party commission with the us and the iraqi government .
this is a good idea , even if the us ambassador to iraq , ryan crocker , deferred any decisions on such a body to washington .
george bush would be well advised to accept the offer , and tehran should continue to advance it . there are still roadblocks .
it is n't helpful when iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki demands that washington openly acknowledge the failure of its campaign in iraq .
and the detention of five iranians by us forces in northern iraq looms as a thorny issue .
but despite these problems , iran and the us should seize the opportunity to make the impossible become a reality . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran says nuke talks with eu back on hours after cancellation iran announced sunday that crunch talks with the eu to break the deadlock over its disputed nuclear program would go ahead as planned , hours after saying they had been postponed .
the discussions are scheduled for may 31 .
-lrb- 27.05.2007 -rrb- germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

according to the paper , the transrapid train would help transport millions of pilgrims along the 800-kilometer -lrb- around 500-mile -rrb- stretch from tehran to iran 's holiest city , mashhad .
a transrapid train ride between the two cities could reduce the trip to two to three hours - a stark contrast to the two days a bus normally needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire on shanghai 's maglev train last year harald späth , managing director of the firm regierungsbaumeister schlegel gmbh , told sz that his company had received an official contract to investigate whether or not the high-speed magnetic levitation train could be built .
he said that then bavarian economic minister otto wiesheu 's visit to iran in 2004 had helped to lay the groundwork for the negotiations .
wiesheu , who left the bavarian government in 2005 , took up a post as board director of germany 's rail company deutsche bahn .
uncertain future späth , who said he had met with iran 's ambassador in berlin , mohammad akhondzadeh , last week in berlin to discuss the project , said that the iranian had allocated $ 1.5 billion -lrb- 1.1 billion euros -rrb- as " start-up financing " for the project .
he also told sz that iran was hoping for additional , private investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad has strained ties apparently , economic sanctions against iran would not stand in the way of the project .
according to sz , german companies exported more than four billion euros in products and services to iran last year .
wiesheu said that the project is " in the very early stages " in iran .
" iran is without a doubt a complicated country , " he told sz .

eu data privacy experts now want to see if google 's data storage practices are in line with eu rules . last week , google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer got a message addressed directly to him .
it was an open letter from the european union 's so-called article 29 data protection working party , which advises the eu commission on data privacy matters . the group sent the letter to google by " snail mail . "
that may be because the 28-member body does not trust the privacy practices of the internet search giant . " they -lrb- google -rrb- are playing an obscure game , " said dietmar müller , press secretary for germany 's data privacy commissioner and article 29 working party chief , peter schaar .
" there is a need for clarification , so that we can pursue this matter . " when you visit a google search site , such as google.com or germany 's google.de , the server automatically records a plethora of information that is made readily available by most computers .
the data sent to google 's servers - most of which are located in the united states - includes the time and date of the connection , as well as technical information about the person 's browser , operating system , screen resolution and so on . the most controversial piece of information stored on the server is the actual search query , which can , over time , paint a revealing picture of people 's likes and dislikes , health problems , sexual orientation , interests and consumption patterns . in addition , all of this information is linked directly to the computer 's ip -lrb- internet protocol -rrb- address , a series of numbers that uniquely identifies the connecting device .
and for returning visitors , google installs a so-called cookie on their computer hard drive , which reaps further information and tracks clicks through the google web site . google has consistently defended the practice , saying it needs this information to improve its products , guard against malicious attacks , investigate internet fraud and fight online spam . " the key is striking a reasonable balance between these goals and that 's the discussion we want to have with the working party , " google 's peter fleischer said . planned merger hardens fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to acquire notorious internet marketer doubleclick but google 's planned 3.1 billion-dollar -lrb- 2.3 billion-euro -rrb- acquisition of doubleclick inc . , a leader in internet marketing technologies , has only intensified concern among data privacy advocates that google intends to exploit sensitive user data for profit . " we are concerned that data will be exchanged with doubleclick , " said johann bizer , a german state-level deputy commissioner for data privacy .
" it is important for google to set the record straight on this . " franco frattini , the european commissioner for justice , freedom and security , has also voiced his support for the open letter . " the letter is not only welcome , but also absolutely necessary , " bizer said .
" there are deficits at google , and they should be more transparent . " paradoxically , google prides itself on the same transparent philosophy that critics say it is lacking . " we are a consumer-facing web site in a way that doubleclick is not , " fleischer said .
he argues that this puts google in " a better position to offer information to consumers on ad targeting and how it all works . " fleischer cited the example of doubleclick 's " opt-out cookie , " a little-known browser cookie that allows users to opt out of the company 's targeted advertising , which is believed to reach 80 to 85 percent of all internet users . google 's acquisition of the notorious internet marketer " is actually good for privacy , " fleischer claims , and google " would never do anything that would undermine the trust of users . " success prompts distrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german data protection commissioner peter schaar google operates the world 's most successful online search engine .
according to a recent ranking by comscore , a leading pollster of the digital world , nearly half of all internet users conducted their online searches through google in march . yahoo came in second in the poll , capturing slightly less than 30 percent of the market .
only 10 percent of users searched the web through microsoft sites , while the ask and time warner networks scored around 5 percent each .
americans alone conducted 7.3 billion searches online in march , according to the comscore poll . google 's role as the undisputed industry-leader may help explain why the us-based company has become the focus of european data protection experts .
although google competitors yahoo and microsoft have similar practices for storing search query data , these companies have so far been spared from the crosshairs of eu data privacy officials . that is an ironic consequence of success , said google 's fleischer , who has his own theory on why google is being singled out . " very early on , we expressed a commitment to work with data privacy officials constructively , " fleischer said .
" i think they thought , let 's start engaging with google , a leader in the search industry , then we might turn to the other companies . " google to let data expire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google search sessions are recorded on company servers in addition , google announced in march that it would anonymize its server logs after 18 to 24 months .
that means that once a user 's data has been on google 's servers for up to two years , it will be automatically stripped of any details that could be used to identify a person . although google employees like to cite philosophical motives for their company 's actions , deputy commissioner bizer said the decision has a more probable economic cause . " google is afraid of the public debate , " bizer said , adding that " this is why the article 29 group 's open letter was so effective " in compelling google to work with them . but fleischer vehemently denied this .
the google approach is different , he said . " we believe there needs to be robust public debate on this issue .
google has never shied away from controversial topics , " fleischer said , citing a 2005 incident in which the us department of justice ordered google to release its server logs to law enforcement .
google resisted , and a compromise was reached in court . fleischer said he intends to deliver an appropriate response to the eu data protection panel before their june 19 meeting in brussels .
he also said he would publish his own letter on the google blog - because " google is committed to being transparent to users and shareholders , " he said . " the net is an exciting place with many lively debates and that 's the world we 're living in , " he said . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- , confirmed that europe and asia had failed to agree on the need to set global , binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier , left , and his chinese colleague yang jiechi " there were disagreements on setting binding targets , " steinmeier told the press conference after the two-day meeting was brought to a conclusion .
he said , however , that european and asian nations agreed there should be a follow-up " regime " to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases after 2012 .
a chairman 's statement issued after the meeting said negotiations on this " should be completed by 2009 at the latest . "
but mitsuo sakaba , spokesman for japanese foreign minister taro aso , said tokyo disagreed with the 2009 deadline , and believed it was more important to include the countries outside the kyoto protocol - the united states , china and india - in the next accord .
sakaba said issuing a chairman 's statement was the usual way to end an asem meeting and the 16 asian and 27 european union ministers or their deputies had reached " not agreement , but acceptance " of the text .
sustainable development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it wanted to play a " constructive role " chinese foreign minister yang jiechi said as the meeting closed that climate change had to be seen against a background of " sustainable development " and that china would play " a constructive role . "
he stressed , however , that the main cuts should come from the industrialized nations , with emergent nations allowed to increase emissions , though more slowly than they increase their wealth .
he said this meant the international community had " common but differing responsibilities " in responding to climate change .
" the developed countries have a long history of emissions and we hope the developed countries will make further , deeper cuts , " he said .
china is a signatory of kyoto , the first international agreement on slashing emissions , but it has so far been exempt from binding targets because it is a developing nation .
japan and european countries have been called for rapid , deep cuts in world emissions of greenhouse gases .
tokyo believes emissions can be cut by 50 per cent by 2050 .
a prelude to the g8 meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not likely to make a breakthrough at the g8 summit the showdown on how best to fight global warming comes just a week ahead of the group of eight summit in heiligendamm , germany , to which chancellor angela merkel has invited both china , india and other leading emerging nations .
the g8 member states are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
together , india and china will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the united states and merkel has warned that a new pact to replace kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up .
india said on monday it would not be tied to emission targets because this will slow economic growth and hinder its efforts to lift a large part of its population out of poverty .
the asian stance comes as another setback for merkel on the environment after washington rejected parts of a draft declaration which she wants g8 leaders to adopt at the june 6-8 summit .
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's house arrest has been extended for yet another year the chairman 's statement issued at the end of the asem included an appeal to myanmar to release opposition leader aung san suu kyi , 61 , the nobel peace prize laureate who was told last week she faced a further year under house arrest , diplomats from europe said .
many european nations were affronted last week by the extension of her detention from four to five years .

" i trust that we will fight to the last minute , " steinmeier said on monday .
" we need binding benchmarks and targets and we have to see whether we can make more headway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier with a week to go before the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , the united states and its partners in the group of eight leading industrial nations appear to be heading for a major clash on climate change .
according to leaked documents , washington has rejected parts of a draft declaration on curbing global warming which germany , as current g8 president , wants leaders to adopt at the meeting .
the us administration rejects the idea of setting mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
german proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is adamant about fighting climate change german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed text on the environment calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it also stresses the need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
hinting at a row with washington , merkel said last week she was pessimistic that the g8 summit would result in a commitment to cut greenhouse emissions .
steinmeier said some progress has been made in forging an understanding between europe and the united states but urged washington to come on board on energy efficiency targets before the g8 gathering .
" we trust that the us will be prepared to work together with us in the field of energy technology , " he said .
" we need to do this . "
he was speaking after a meeting between the so-called eu troika - grouping the german and portuguese foreign ministers and eu foreign policy chief javier solana - and chinese foreign minister yang jiechi .
after kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and china could be important factors in the fight against global warming germany is seeking to tie both china and india into a new pact on fighting carbon emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol runs out .
together , the two vast developing nations are set to surpass the united states ' output of greenhouse gases in 2015 .
the german chancellor has warned that efforts to fight global warming were doomed without them .
unlike the united states , china signed up to kyoto but its status as a developing nation exempts it from binding emissions targets .
yang refused to be drawn on whether beijing would agree to be tied to emission limits in the post-kyoto era , saying china needs to strike a balance between fighting pollution and fighting poverty .
" our position is that we are a developing nation and climate change is not the doing of developing countries , though every country has to do what it can to help the environment , " he said .
" china 's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line , so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment . "
a serious blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is having a direct impact on the living environment earlier monday , merkel 's efforts to rally the developing world on climate change received a serious blow when india , which had been invited to the heiligendamm summit , said it would reject proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the indian environment ministry said restrictions would slow the country 's boooming economy and set back efforts to fight poverty .

" we need multilateral agreements to deal on a global basis with the challenges facing humanity , " merkel said after a meeting with nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives .
pelosi , for her part , stressed her commitment to " save the planet " and said she supported cooperation on climate change as she met with merkel .
pelosi , a democrat who opposes president george w. bush 's environmental policy , also called for " global and sustainable solutions " to halt climate change , including making greater use of advanced technology .

she praised merkel 's " extraordinary leadership " in addressing the issue of global warming .
merkel said the united states was " moving a lot " on climate change , but made no reference to the differences threatening to derail a deal at the june 6-8 summit in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm .

the discovery could lead to treatments that complement flu vaccines in the event of a human epidemic of the virus .
the h5n1 bird flu virus is estimated to have killed more than 180 people around the world since 2003 .
some countries are already stockpiling vaccines for a possible bird flu outbreak in humans , but no one knows how effective they might be .
' emergency antidote ' this is because the particular strain of bird flu that might eventually spark a human pandemic is unknown .
but scientists working in switzerland , vietnam and the united states say they have isolated antibodies that they hope could offer protection against several different strains of the virus simultaneously .
antibodies are used by our immune system to neutralise bacteria and viruses - in this case , the scientists have isolated antibodies that bird flu survivors in vietnam produced to fight off the disease .

" we in a way exploit the immune response of an individual who has been infected and has survived the infection and of course has made antibodies that neutralise these viruses , " he said .
" and using this technique , we can isolate the cells that make these antibodies so that this antibody can now be reproduced in vitro and eventually massively produced to treat other individuals . "
the antibodies could be used to protect key workers , such as nurses and doctors , in countries where a bird flu epidemic strikes .
the researchers say it could also be used as an emergency antidote in people who have already been infected with bird flu - if administered within a few days .
it is hoped human trials could begin shortly .

the discovery could lead to treatments that complement flu vaccines in the event of a human epidemic of the virus .
the h5n1 bird flu virus is estimated to have killed more than 180 people around the world since 2003 .
some countries are already stockpiling vaccines for a possible bird flu outbreak in humans , but no one knows how effective they might be .
' emergency antidote ' this is because the particular strain of bird flu that might eventually spark a human pandemic is unknown .
but scientists working in switzerland , vietnam and the united states say they have isolated antibodies that they hope could offer protection against several different strains of the virus simultaneously .
antibodies are used by our immune system to neutralise bacteria and viruses - in this case , the scientists have isolated antibodies that bird flu survivors in vietnam produced to fight off the disease .
professor antonio lanzavecchia , at the institute for research in biomedicine in switzerland , says the antibodies have already proven effective in the lab and in mice and he is confident that they could be used in humans .
" we in a way exploit the immune response of an individual who has been infected and has survived the infection and of course has made antibodies that neutralise these viruses , " he said .
" and using this technique , we can isolate the cells that make these antibodies so that this antibody can now be reproduced in vitro and eventually massively produced to treat other individuals . "
the antibodies could be used to protect key workers , such as nurses and doctors , in countries where a bird flu epidemic strikes .
the researchers say it could also be used as an emergency antidote in people who have already been infected with bird flu - if administered within a few days .
it is hoped human trials could begin shortly .

some canoeists say their sport does not receive fair treatment , because they only have access to some 4 % of all welsh rivers .
most riverbanks and rights to the water belong to angling clubs , who pay large sums for the right to fish .
bbc 's week in week out was told abuse and intimidation is already creating a tense atmosphere on some rivers .
some canoeists feel that decades of negotiations have made no progress , the programme found .
they want the law to be changed to give access to all . "
one day , it will be the wrong persons at the wrong time " gethyn thomas , carmarthenshire fishermen 's federation gareth bryant of llandysul paddlers , in carmarthenshire , said they have a good relationship with the town 's angling club , but said some canoeists were getting frustrated .
he said : " the access that we 've got on here is about 5oom that we can use year round , and that is 5oom of the river teifi which is almost loo miles long , so , it 's not very much .
" at the moment you , you ca n't canoe anywhere else on the river , unless you contact a landowner of the land which juts up to the river , or if you are going on to fishing club waters , then the fishing clubs as well .
" the problem is , is that there are so many landowners on a small stretch of water , to try and contact each individual land owner , and ask permission is impossible . "
but some anglers have said they will fight any legislation that undermines their right to fish .
out of bounds they added canoeists should work out local access agreements to use the river , in the same way as fishermen .
gethyn thomas , of the carmarthenshire fishermen 's federation , claimed canoeists were already ignoring existing laws and were paddling on out-of-bounds areas .
mr thomas said it was a worrying trend that has brought them into conflict with anglers . "
the problem is , is that there are so many landowners on a small stretch of water " gareth bryant , llandysul paddlers " we are trying to tell our members as anglers , not to get involved in any confrontation , because there 's anglers as well which we have got to watch , but maybe ... one day , it will be the wrong persons at the wrong time , and there will be something nasty , " he added .
the welsh assembly government has said access to rivers must be through local agreements , but they are actively looking at ways of improving access for all .
but at least one political party , the liberal democrats , is in favour of changing the law .
elsewhere in the uk , scotland have already introduced a new law to allow reasonable access .
ashley charlwood of the welsh canoeing association said : " it 's an exciting time in wales at the moment , the new government of wales act , gives wales the opportunity to introduce legislation that sees beneficial for wales .
" westminster has already made a statement on 16 october last year that recreational and access to inland water is for the welsh assembly to consider .
" fundamentally , we believe that there needs to be legislative intervention . "

one day , it will be the wrong persons at the wrong time gethyn thomas , carmarthenshire fishermen 's federation gareth bryant of llandysul paddlers , in carmarthenshire , said they have a good relationship with the town 's angling club , but said some canoeists were getting frustrated .
he said : " the access that we 've got on here is about 5oom that we can use year round , and that is 5oom of the river teifi which is almost loo miles long , so , it 's not very much .
" at the moment you , you ca n't canoe anywhere else on the river , unless you contact a landowner of the land which juts up to the river , or if you are going on to fishing club waters , then the fishing clubs as well .
" the problem is , is that there are so many landowners on a small stretch of water , to try and contact each individual land owner , and ask permission is impossible . "
but some anglers have said they will fight any legislation that undermines their right to fish .
out of bounds they added canoeists should work out local access agreements to use the river , in the same way as fishermen .
gethyn thomas , of the carmarthenshire fishermen 's federation , claimed canoeists were already ignoring existing laws and were paddling on out-of-bounds areas .
mr thomas said it was a worrying trend that has brought them into conflict with anglers .
the problem is , is that there are so many landowners on a small stretch of water gareth bryant , llandysul paddlers " we are trying to tell our members as anglers , not to get involved in any confrontation , because there 's anglers as well which we have got to watch , but maybe ... one day , it will be the wrong persons at the wrong time , and there will be something nasty , " he added .
the welsh assembly government has said access to rivers must be through local agreements , but they are actively looking at ways of improving access for all .
but at least one political party , the liberal democrats , is in favour of changing the law .
elsewhere in the uk , scotland have already introduced a new law to allow reasonable access .
ashley charlwood of the welsh canoeing association said : " it 's an exciting time in wales at the moment , the new government of wales act , gives wales the opportunity to introduce legislation that sees beneficial for wales .
" westminster has already made a statement on 16 october last year that recreational and access to inland water is for the welsh assembly to consider .
" fundamentally , we believe that there needs to be legislative intervention . "

lord butler told the hay festival in powys there should be " more substance to the government and less flim-flam " .
he said he had seen the powers of the cabinet steadily decrease .
lord butler also criticised standards of government white papers , saying some had read like " sales manifestos " and been full of soundbites .
he said tony blair 's successor at no 10 should restore cabinet government , and papers should be properly circulated to ministers in order that they can make informed decisions .
lazy lord butler served as cabinet secretary for 10 years until 1998 and led the inquiry into the intelligence which took britain into the iraq war .
he said he had served under five prime ministers - edward heath , harold wilson , margaret thatcher , john major , and finally under mr blair for an eight month period .
the only decision the cabinet made collectively during the time under mr blair , he told the festival audience , was about the millennium dome , and that was when the prime minister was absent at a memorial service , and the matter was steered through by his deputy john prescott .
he acknowledged that the nature of governance has gradually weakened , not just under new labour but since the second world war .
lord butler , 69 , said lady thatcher ran her cabinet by " haranguing , dominating and putting the fear of god into people " while her successor sir john major ran his " like the captain of a team " .
he welcomed the fact that gordon brown has already indicated he will look at reform in this area and said if parliament did not put government under close scrutiny , then government got lazy .
he said the system of decison making in government was " faulty " , adding he did not think the public was " swayed " by tomorrow 's hedlines but politicians think they are .
what matters in the long term , he said , were good policies .
lord butler also criticised the standard of government white papers , saying some have read like " sales manifestos " and been full of soundbites , and said select committees in parliament should be made more " effective " .

lord butler told the hay festival in powys there should be " more substance to the government and less flim-flam " .
he said he had seen the powers of the cabinet steadily decrease .
lord butler also criticised standards of government white papers , saying some had read like " sales manifestos " and been full of soundbites .
he said tony blair 's successor at no 10 should restore cabinet government , and papers should be properly circulated to ministers in order that they can make informed decisions .
lazy lord butler served as cabinet secretary for 10 years until 1998 and led the inquiry into the intelligence which took britain into the iraq war .
he said he had served under five prime ministers - edward heath , harold wilson , margaret thatcher , john major , and finally under mr blair for an eight month period .
the only decision the cabinet made collectively during the time under mr blair , he told the festival audience , was about the millennium dome , and that was when the prime minister was absent at a memorial service , and the matter was steered through by his deputy john prescott .
he acknowledged that the nature of governance has gradually weakened , not just under new labour but since the second world war .
lord butler , 69 , said lady thatcher ran her cabinet by " haranguing , dominating and putting the fear of god into people " while her successor sir john major ran his " like the captain of a team " .
he welcomed the fact that gordon brown has already indicated he will look at reform in this area and said if parliament did not put government under close scrutiny , then government got lazy .
he said the system of decison making in government was " faulty " , adding he did not think the public was " swayed " by tomorrow 's hedlines but politicians think they are .
what matters in the long term , he said , were good policies .
lord butler also criticised the standard of government white papers , saying some have read like " sales manifestos " and been full of soundbites , and said select committees in parliament should be made more " effective " .

speaking at the hay festival in powys , he said there would have to be a bigger change " than has happened in the last 10 years " to meet the threat .
it was the closest that the man many see as a future labour leader came to criticising the record of outgoing prime minister tony blair .
the minister spent the rest of the time defending his government 's actions .
there was vehement criticism from the two other panellists , environmental authors jeremy leggett and mark lynas . "
the conservatives reduced emissions massively by taking the miners out of business , so do n't take credit for that ! "
mark lynas , author mr milliband said the uk was on course to deliver cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , including carbon dioxide , that were double what the kyoto protocol had demanded .
no other government in the world could claim that , he said : " for the first time we have broken the link between strong economic growth and carbon . "
however , the claim was strongly denied by mark lynas , author of six degrees , our future on a hotter planet .
mr lynas said that progress begun under the previous conservative administration - when the country was moved off coal and into cleaner gas - had helped new labour look better than it was .
he said : " carbon emissions have been going up since 1997 .
the conservatives reduced emissions massively by taking the miners out of business , so do n't take credit for that ! "
mr lynas said there were only eight years left to make massive global cuts in carbon dioxide emissions if a disastrous increase in temperatures was to be avoided .
" so how can you allow this runaway expansion in aviation ? " he asked .
the minister pointed out that chancellor gordon brown had doubled air passenger duty .
there was strong criticism of the government 's alleged reluctance to support new forms of cleaner energy .
mr leggett , who also runs a solar panel company , said last week 's energy white paper was a " fig-leaf for the nuclear industry " and " replete with consultation and light on policy " .
mr miliband defended his government 's renewed interest in nuclear power by saying that if reactors were not replaced in the coming years the resulting energy gap would mean we would turn instead to carbon rich fuels like coal and gas .
' time running out ' he also denied nuclear energy would suck public money away from renewable clean energy , saying , " by 2010 we 'll be spending one billion pounds on renewables " .
however , there was much laughter when mr lynas said he had calculated that at present levels of government grants , it would take 76,000 years for every house in britain to have a solar panel .
there was agreement on hardly anything .
mr miliband appeared reluctant to respond to invitations to say there would be big changes on the environment when mr brown becomes pm shortly .
both mr leggett and mr lynas said that with time running out so quickly for the planet , courageous political leadership was vital , and there was still no sign of it .

speaking at the hay festival in powys , he said there would have to be a bigger change " than has happened in the last 10 years " to meet the threat .
it was the closest that the man many see as a future labour leader came to criticising the record of outgoing prime minister tony blair .
the minister spent the rest of the time defending his government 's actions .
there was vehement criticism from the two other panellists , environmental authors jeremy leggett and mark lynas .
the conservatives reduced emissions massively by taking the miners out of business , so do n't take credit for that !
mark lynas , author mr milliband said the uk was on course to deliver cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , including carbon dioxide , that were double what the kyoto protocol had demanded .
no other government in the world could claim that , he said : " for the first time we have broken the link between strong economic growth and carbon . "
however , the claim was strongly denied by mark lynas , author of six degrees , our future on a hotter planet .
mr lynas said that progress begun under the previous conservative administration - when the country was moved off coal and into cleaner gas - had helped new labour look better than it was .
he said : " carbon emissions have been going up since 1997 .
the conservatives reduced emissions massively by taking the miners out of business , so do n't take credit for that ! "
mr lynas said there were only eight years left to make massive global cuts in carbon dioxide emissions if a disastrous increase in temperatures was to be avoided .
" so how can you allow this runaway expansion in aviation ? " he asked .
the minister pointed out that chancellor gordon brown had doubled air passenger duty .
there was strong criticism of the government 's alleged reluctance to support new forms of cleaner energy .
mr leggett , who also runs a solar panel company , said last week 's energy white paper was a " fig-leaf for the nuclear industry " and " replete with consultation and light on policy " .
mr miliband defended his government 's renewed interest in nuclear power by saying that if reactors were not replaced in the coming years the resulting energy gap would mean we would turn instead to carbon rich fuels like coal and gas .
' time running out ' he also denied nuclear energy would suck public money away from renewable clean energy , saying , " by 2010 we 'll be spending one billion pounds on renewables " .
however , there was much laughter when mr lynas said he had calculated that at present levels of government grants , it would take 76,000 years for every house in britain to have a solar panel .
there was agreement on hardly anything .
mr miliband appeared reluctant to respond to invitations to say there would be big changes on the environment when mr brown becomes pm shortly .

construction will start on the eastport project after a deal was agreed between great yarmouth port authority and international port holdings .
the scheme is regarded as a focus for the town 's regeneration , creating 1,000 jobs and bringing in extra visitors .
great yarmouth port company will develop the outer harbour and take over the operation of the port .
richard ellis of the east of england development agency , which invested £ 8.75m into eastport , said : " this is an historic moment , not only for great yarmouth , but also for the whole of norfolk . "
seven-year wait barry coleman , leader of great yarmouth borough council , said the news of the development was the " best possible " news for people who lived , worked or ran businesses in the town .
" to say that i am thrilled is an under-statement , " he said .
" it has been a long time coming , and i am so pleased for those who kept the faith over many years . "
the outer harbour project was first proposed in 2000 .
the government gave it the go-ahead two-and-a-half years ago and it cleared planning approval six months later .
since then , complex legal work has taken place with the commercial partner international port holdings to complete the deal .

graham brady was told to stick to his brief as europe spokesman .
the altrincham and sale west mp spoke out in defence of grammar schools in the row caused by the party 's decision to turn against selection by ability .
he released data to the times , suggesting areas with selective schools got better exam results .
party leader david cameron has promised more city academies - the privately sponsored state schools championed by prime minister tony blair - and more streaming and setting within existing schools . "
graham would not have been doing his job if he had not stepped in and defended the grammar schools " nigel evans conservative mp q & a : what are grammars ?
but former grammar school pupil mr brady supplied data to the times which indicated that in areas with no selective education fewer pupils get five or more gcses at grade a * -c including english and maths .
" these facts appear to confirm my own experiences : that selection raises the standards for everyone in both grammar and high schools in selective areas , " he told the paper .
" it is vitally important that policy should be developed with a full understanding of all of these facts , which might lead to the introduction of selection in other ways . "
fellow conservative nigel evans , mp for ribble valley , said mr brady should " absolutely not " be censured for speaking out .
he said the way that shadow education secretary david willetts announced the policy " looked as if it was an attack on grammar schools " .
' 100 % support ' " graham would not have been doing his job if he had not stepped in and defended the grammar schools , " mr evans told bbc radio 4 's today programme . "
mr brady 's crime was to re-open a debate which the tory leader has declared to be over " bbc political editor nick robinson " but at the same time graham is 100 % behind ensuring that the academies that david willetts and david cameron wish to see rolled around the country is going to become a reality so that youngsters of all abilities can get the education that they deserve . "
mr evans said he himself would continue to speak out about the grammar school he attended and the one in his constituency , but was also going to support the party 's policy .
" we are all getting behind the policy of ensuring that we 're now going to concentrate and focus on those schools , those areas where youngsters are looking for a good education but at the moment it 's not happening . "
a number of newspapers cite conservative party sources as suggesting mr brady may be axed from his role in a party reshuffle expected this summer .

zheng xiaoyu was convicted on charges of taking bribes and of dereliction of duty , xinhua news agency reported .
the sentence is unusually harsh for a senior figure , but zheng could have his sentence reduced to life on appeal .
the verdict came as the government announced plans for the first ever recall system of unsafe food products .
beijing has been under pressure to act over increasing concern both at home and abroad about the poor standards of chinese-produced food and medicines .
name poisoned state television showed footage of a grey-haired zheng - who was expelled from the communist party earlier this year - appearing in court in beijing flanked by police officers .
he had been accused by an official investigation last month of accepting more than 6.5m yuan -lrb- $ 850,000 -rrb- in bribes to approve hundreds of drugs .
one company , kongliyuan group , allegedly paid zheng bribes in return for approving 277 drugs , mostly antibiotics .
zheng 's former secretary , cao wenzhuang , also faced trial , accused of accepting bribes .
thirty-one other people were also alleged to have been involved in the scandal , including zheng 's wife , liu naixue , and his son , zheng hairong .
following zheng 's sacking in 2005 , the chinese government announced a review of about 170,000 medical licences that were awarded during his tenure at the agency .
dozens of people have died in china because of poor quality or fake drugs .
last year , a sub-standard antibiotic , xinfu , which was not properly sterilised , caused the deaths of 11 people .
thirteen babies died of malnutrition in 2005 after being fed powdered milk that contained no nutritional value .

the royal navy has four of these submarines , each armed with 16 missiles carrying multiple nuclear warheads .
at all times one boat is on patrol .
bbc radio 4 's file on 4 has heard sailors ' complaints that the condition of these and the rest of the navy 's submarines are being affected by government cost-cutting .
indeed one sailor serving on a trident submarine claims they are " just about " seaworthy , with crews scouring other subs for spare parts in a massive " make do and mend " operation .
the senior rating said crews frequently experienced problems with oxygen production equipment on board as well as with the batteries on the craft .
" our subs are nuclear powered but if for any reason we ca n't use the nuclear power we would use the battery , " he said .
" if it was in an escape situation , the reactor would be shut down and you would need the battery .
" there 's so many things that seem to go wrong that the guys do an unbelievable job fixing it , and how they keep going is beyond me .
" if the government want a premier league weapons platform , you need to have the equipment , the skills , you need to have all of this in place in case anything goes wrong and they do n't have that .
" they want a premier league system and they 're paying third division prices .
he added : " the boats are safe to go to sea , but i would say just safe . "
i have seen water all over the control room floor , we 're talking about half an inch over a large area .
you deal with it , mop it up but it is not ideal former petty officer paul reidy former first sea lord sir alan west argues that cost cutting is a problem across the navy .
sir alan said the service has some excellent sailors of whom the nation should be proud , but added : " what really demotivates them is that they 're working flat out to make sure their system , their ship , their aeroplane is the best in the world , sorry we have n't got this spare part . "
but armed forces minister adam ingram denied there was any problem .
he said the navy 's overall morale is of the " highest standard " .
and he rejected the claims that trident submarines are just about seaworthy .
' highly safe ' " that has never been put to me " said mr ingram , who added that safety on royal navy submarines was of the " highest order . "
but sailors on the navy 's nuclear powered trafalgar class submarines , which carry conventional weapons , are also concerned .
former petty officer paul reidy said that towards the end of his career he was worried about the state of the submarines he served on .
the vessels suffered from leaking hatches and unfinished equipment , he said .
' leaking hatches ' " the hatches were constantly leaking , they were sealing at 50 to 100 metres down when it should be three metres down .
he added : " i have seen water all over the control room floor , we 're talking about half an inch over a large area .
you deal with it , mop it up but it is not ideal . "
another sailor , who wished to remain anonymous , said in his five years aboard trafalgar class vessels they experienced potential dangerous failures of electrical systems .
he said on one occasion his craft might have sunk to the bottom of the sea with its crew trapped inside following a systems failure .
" if we were n't coming up we would have been stuck there , if we were going down we would not have been able to come back up . "
